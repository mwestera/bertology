"Al - Zaman : American |0 forces | killed |1 Shaikh | Abdullah al - Ani , the preacher at the mosque in the town of Qaim , near the Syrian border ."
[ This |0 killing | of a respected cleric will be causing |2 us | |1 trouble | for years to come . ]
DPA : Iraqi |0 authorities | announced that |0 they | had busted up 3 terrorist |1 cells | operating in Baghdad .
Two of them were being run by 2 officials of the Ministry of the Interior !
"The |0 MoI | in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI , so |0 this | would be like having |0 J. | Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level |1 members | of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s ."
The third was being run by the head of an investment firm .
|0 You | wonder if |0 he | was manipulating the |1 market | with his bombing targets .
The |0 cells | were operating in the Ghazaliyah and al - Jihad districts of the capital .
"Although the announcement was probably made to show |1 progress | in identifying and breaking up terror |1 cells | , |0 I | do n't find the |1 news | that the |0 Baathists | continue to penetrate the Iraqi |1 government | very hopeful ."
|0 It | reminds |1 me | too much of the ARVN officers |0 who | were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam .
Al - Zaman : |0 Guerrillas | killed a |1 member | of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping |1 him | in Mosul .
"The police |0 commander | of Ninevah Province announced that |0 bombings | had declined 80 |1 percent | in Mosul , whereas there had been a big |0 jump | in the number of kidnappings ."
On Wednesday |0 guerrillas | had kidnapped a cosmetic |1 surgeon | and his wife while |0 they | were on their way home .
"In Suwayrah , Kut Province , two car bombs were discovered before they could be detonated ."
"( |0 Kut | is in southeastern Iraq and has an overwhelmingly Shiite |1 population | , |0 who | are on the lookout for Baathist saboteurs and willingly turn |1 them | in ."
This |0 willingness | is the main difference in the number of bombings in the south as opposed to the center - north of the country . )
"In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain , assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University , was assassinated with his driver in the Salikh district ."
"|0 Guerrillas | killed an |1 engineer | , Asi Ali , from Tikrit ."
"|0 They | also killed |1 Shaikh | Hamid 'Akkab , a clan elder of a branch of the Dulaim tribe in Tikrit ."
His mother was also killed in the attack .
Two other Dulaim leaders have been killed in the past week and a half .
"|0 Guerrillas | near Hawijah launched an |1 attack | |0 that | left |1 6 | dead , including 4 Iraqi soldiers ."
|0 One | of them was from the Jubur tribe and was deputy commander of the Hawijah garrison .
"Two hundred |0 members | of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday , protesting the |1 killing | of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army |1 uniforms | ."
"( |0 This | is a largely Sunni Arab clan , and some Sunni |0 observers | have accused Shiite |1 elements | in the government of being behind the assassination ; |0 it | is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the |1 Batawi | leaders for cooperating with the Dec. 15 elections . )"
Al - Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral |0 Commission | on Friday denied a |1 request | of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 |1 individuals | from running on party lists in the Dec. 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office .
The |0 Commission | said |0 it | had no legal |1 grounds | for such an exclusion .
This |0 item | is a small one and easily missed .
But in my view |0 it | is highly significant .
"The Debaathification Commission had been pushed by Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress very hard , and had pushed many Sunni |1 Arabs | into the arms of the guerrillas ."
"Chalabi has been increasingly marginalized within Iraq , however , despite his ties of clientelage with Washington and Tehran ."
"|0 He | is no longer in the dominant Shiite list , the United Iraqi Alliance , and wo n't have many |1 seats | in the new parliament ."
"Some 2,000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months , something |0 Chalabi | would have blocked if |0 he | could have ."
Now the Electoral |0 Commission | is refusing to punish |1 people | for mere past Baath Party membership .
The |0 situation | in Iraq is only going to get better this |1 way | .
"If |0 someone | committed a |1 crime | against humanity , prosecute the |1 person | ."
"If |0 he | or she did not , then |0 they | should have all the same |1 rights | as other Iraqis ."
|0 Al | - Sharq al - Awsat reports that a key |0 eyewitness | in the trial of Saddam Hussein for a 1982 massacre at Dujail has died .
A |0 team | from the court managed to take his |1 deposition | before |0 he | died .
The |0 trial | begins again Nov. 28 .
"In Baghdad the |0 fighting | still continues in several areas , mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya ."
"|0 Baghdadis | do n't venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more , |0 you | never know where you might get stuck ."
There has been |0 talk | that the night curfew might be implemented again .
"My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now , |0 helicopters | have been circling over our heads non-stop ."
|0 Fedayeen | are now visible on the street and |0 they | have become bolder than ever .
"Yesterday there were |0 tens | of them putting road |1 blocks | on our street and setting up |1 mortars | , |0 they | only come out in the open when |0 Americans | leave the |1 area | , then |0 they | start firing |1 mortars | indiscriminately and shooting their AK - |1 47's | in the air ."
"|0 They | are setting the road |1 blocks | at the exact same positions |0 they | were during the war last year , |0 which | indicates |0 they | are the same people ."
"And there is |0 nothing | |0 we | can do about it really , |0 people | |0 who | are suggesting that |0 we | go out and fight |1 them | are living in dream land ."
"Even the |0 IP | and ICDC have abandoned the |1 neighbourhood | , and |0 those | are trained and armed , so do n't expect scared |1 civilians | to do |1 anything | except to hide inside and pray a |0 helicopter | or a tank does n't bomb |1 them | , and also how are American |0 soldiers | going to distinguish the brave and valiant |1 civilians | from the Fedayeen ?"
"|0 Everyone | is apprehensive , there is some |0 talk | that |0 April | 9th and 10th are going to be bloody days ."
"Most |0 people | have n't gone to work the last few days , although it seems that the |0 rest | of Baghdad is ' normal ' ( if |0 you | can define |1 what | |0 normal | is ) ."
"There are |0 rumours | about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks , governmental and public property similar to the one |0 that | took |1 place | last April , and |0 I | have already overheard |0 youngsters | in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying |1 things | like "" This time |0 we | will be the first to loot , |0 we | did n't get |1 anything | the last time "" ."
"|0 Mosques | are calling for donating |1 blood | , food , and medicine for Fallujah , and several |0 convoys | have already headed out for Fallujah , |0 most | of them returned later though ."
"|0 What | irritates |1 me | is this sudden false ' solidarity ' between Sunni and Shi'ite clerics , |0 we | all know that |0 they | would be glad to get at each other s throats when |0 they | have the |1 chance | , and Shia |0 clerics | were describing Fallujan |1 insurgents | as ' Ba'athists ' , ' Saddamites ' , ' Wahhabis ' , and ' terrorists ' just a few days ago ."
So |0 what | happened ?
"|0 I | guess |0 it | 's just the old new Arab ' Me against my brother , me and my brother against my cousin , me and my cousin against my enemy ' , or ' The |0 enemy | of my enemy is my friend ' thing going on again ."
"Speaking of Fallujah , |0 we | have only Al - |1 Jazeera | to rely on for our news from there ."
"|0 They | have sent over their top |1 reporter | Ahmed Mansour to the town , and |0 he | is spouting all |1 kinds | of propaganda hourly reminding |1 me | of Al - Sahhaf ."
""" They are |0 targetting | |1 ambulances | "" , "" American |0 snipers | are shooting |1 children | and pregnant women "" , and "" |0 They | are using cluster |1 bombs | against civilians "" is all |0 you | get to hear from him ."
"|0 He | did once make an unforgivable |1 error | when |0 he | mentioned that Fallujan |0 militants | were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al - Golan , but of course |0 that | is okay for Al - Jazeera ."
|0 Someone | |0 who | called |1 himself | Abu Hafs from the Ibn Al - Khattab Brigades ( another new group ) was on Al - Jazeera describing the enormous |1 casualties | among the Marines and |0 he | sweared that American |0 soldiers | were mutilating the |1 bodies | of dead insurgents .
Over 300 Iraqis are reported dead and 500 reported wounded in Fallujah alone .
Al - Iraqiyah |0 tv | said that |0 ICDC | were controlling |1 Ramadi | .
"Azzaman |0 newspaper | mentioned an |1 announcement | signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin , an Al - Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website ' the voice of Jihad ' , in which |0 he | stated that "" although mutilating dead |1 bodies | is not originally permitted in Islam , but in this case it is allowed if |0 Muslims | use |1 it | against infidels to deter |1 them | from committing criminal |1 actions | "" ."
"|0 He | added that "" |0 America | does not understand |1 anything | except the language of force and retaliation , they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole |0 world | to see "" , and that "" the |0 day | will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged , defiled , and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters "" ."
Elena 's motorcycle |0 tour | through the region around Chernobyl has revived |1 interest | in one of the most serious nuclear disasters in history .
"|0 We | all know |0 what | happened , but even to this day , there are many different |0 versions | and opinions on how |0 it | happened and what |1 effect | |0 Chernobyl | will have on the health of people affected by the fallout ."
UPDATE :
Now |0 you | can tour |1 Chernobyl | and write your own |1 story | .
|0 This | is not a post about fault - finding or assigning |1 blame | .
|0 It | is a time to learn |0 what | happened and how |0 it | may affect the |1 future | .
There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR ( United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) |0 report | in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific |0 evidence | of any significant radiation - related health effects to most people exposed .
This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release titled THE |1 MYTHS | OF CHERNOBYL |0 which | contained |1 the | following :
"|0 One | of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor |0 accident | in 1986 caused many |1 thousands | of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions , and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation ."
"Many |0 people | still believe |1 that | to be true , even though the |0 Ministry | of Russian Federation on Civil Defence , Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters ( EMERCOM of Russia ) reported |1 this | in 1996 :"
CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT : TEN YEARS ON
"In the last decade , there has been a real and significant |0 increase | in childhood and , to a certain extent , adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union ( Wi940 ) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl accident until proven otherwise ."
The prestigious |0 IAEA | ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) published an early |1 report | on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health |0 effects | .
"However , in April 2001 , the |0 IAEA | published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - |1 Lessons | learned . |0 which | contradict the earlier |1 reports | ."
Here are some |0 excerpts | :
"The dramatic |0 increase | in radiation - induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine , which have been observed since 1991 , continues to this day ."
"... a drop in the birth rate , a deterioration in women 's reproductive health , an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth , and a deterioration in neonatal health ...."
"The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine - in the post-accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies : the morbidity |0 rate | is going up , the |0 number | of really healthy children is dropping , and |0 disability | is increasing ."
"As a parent , |0 I | can well imagine how |1 painful | it must be for those families whose |0 children | are succumbing to radiation poisoning ."
There is a |0 lot | to learn about Chernobyl .
Being well - informed will give |2 you | |1 certainty | and |0 that | is desirable in a world of conflicting reports .
There are a |0 wealth | of references on Chernobyl .
Read |1 some | of the following links and draw your own |1 conclusions | .
These |0 links | present the many |1 viewpoints | |0 that | existed and still exist about the disaster called |1 Chernobyl | :

|0 I | would be interested in hearing what |1 conclusions | |0 you | reached and what |0 you | found |0 that | was most convincing .
radiation :
As a child in the 50's |0 I | had a |1 lot | of glandular problems and |0 they | treated |1 it | with radiation therapy ( primitive at best ! ) and stopped when a |0 lesion | on my neck started enlarging -- |0 they | said |0 it | was not CA but stopped the |1 treatments | ....
Remember the old shoe sizing |1 machines | |0 that | was a form of radiation xray ?
That too was stopped .
Do n't have to mention |1 what | |0 radiation | has done and is still doing to Hirsohima & Nagaski folks -- there can be no |0 doubts | about the effects of radiation in Chernobyl .......
The Chernobyl Children 's |0 Project | ( http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp ) offers several |1 ways | to help the |1 children | of that region .
"|0 One | of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program , wherein a |0 child | can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer ."
"Even a little |0 time | spent receiving wholesome , uncontaminated |1 food | , good medical care , etc. can add years to their lives ."
|0 S. | and I have an |1 acquaintance | |0 who | has hosted |1 several | of these children for many years ; to see these little |1 ones | breaks the |1 heart | .
"The |0 urge | to protect and gather |1 them | all in is almost overwhelming , and makes |1 me | more grateful for the blessings |0 I | have ."
"Take |1 care | , my |1 friend | , Linda"
|0 I | 'm sorry to say Elena 's story has been revealed to be a fake .
|1 What | do the new al - Qaeda videotape and audio |0 speeches | of Bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri tell |2 us | about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization ?
"Because the |0 US | and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2 / |1 3s | of the top 25 al - Qaeda commanders , the middle |0 managers | are not in close contact with al - Zawahiri and Bin Laden ."
The |0 tape | was a way to signal |1 priorities | .
"|0 These | are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow |1 Gen. | Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military "" president "" |0 who | had made a |1 coup | in 1999 and has thrown in his |1 lot | with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda ."
|0 Musharraf | has been trying to purge his officer |1 corps | of the substantial number of al - Qaeda sympathizers .
"His military |0 intelligence | has captured major |1 figures | like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operatives , over |1 400 | of whom the |0 Pakistanis | have turned over to the US ."
"|0 Musharraf | held |1 elections | in October of 2002 , in which center - right |0 parties | did well , but in which nearly 20 |0 percent | of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition , MMA ."
"|0 MMA | also captured the Northwest Frontier |1 Province | , |0 which | probably shelters |1 Bin | Laden and al - Zawahiri , and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province , also on the Afghanistan border ."
"If al - |0 Qaeda | can kill |1 Musharraf | or instigate a military |1 coup | against him by Islamist junior officers , |0 they | can hope to catapult the |1 MMA | to power as political allies and hosts ."
"|0 They | would thereby gain |1 control | of a major base for terrorist operations , |0 which | is also a nuclear power ."
"All |0 this | is highly unlikely , as with most al - Qaeda crackpot schemes ."
But so was it unlikely that a small |0 group | of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over |1 Afghanistan | .
Response : The |0 US | must do |1 whatever | |0 it | can to strengthen the |1 legitimacy | of the Pakistani government .
"On the one hand , |1 it | should pressure |1 Musharraf | to take off his |1 uniform | and run for president in a fair election , and to repeal the contentious "" Legal Framework |1 Order | "" |0 that | essentially perpetuates his |1 dictatorship | ."
"On the other , restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League - N and Pakistan People 's Party , |0 who | can defeat the |1 MMA | in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police ."
"On the other hand , the |0 US | should strong - arm |1 India | and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue ."
|0 Al | - Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf 's |1 lack | of progress in helping the |1 Muslims | of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow .
"The Kashmir |0 issue | generates far more |1 terrorism | , and even the threat of nuclear war , than |0 Iraq | ever did ."
2 ) Target |1 Israel | and encourage the worst |1 elements | of the Palestinians by playing on the iron fist policies of the Sharon government .
"Response : The |0 US | has succeeded in politically isolating |1 Hamas | , and started the |1 process | of cutting off its |1 funding | ."
This terrorist |0 organization | can now only pull off far less sophisticated |1 bombings | and attacks .
|0 It | should continue to be defanged .
"But Sharon 's iron |0 fist | is simply not working as a means of establishing general |1 peace | , and the |0 Bush | administration will have to finally apply effective |1 pressure | on Sharon to stop his |1 outrages | in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza ."
"Sharon 's hard |0 line | has worked in tandem with Hamas 's terrorism to ratchet up |1 tensions | further and further , |0 which | spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United |1 States | ."
"|0 Israel | owes the United |2 States | at least this |1 much | , in this crisis , to cease militarily unnecessary |1 provocations | and establish genuine |1 peace | ."
"3 ) Make |1 Iraq | another Afghanistan , using the Republican Right 's own |1 tactics | against them ."
"Response : |0 Iraq | is actually hostile territory for al - Qaeda , and without Iraqi sympathizers |0 it | can not succeed there ."
"By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives , the |0 US | may be able to get |1 Iraqis | on its side , so that |0 they | turn in the |1 foreigners | ."
"Certainly , the |0 Shiites | already hate al - |1 Qaeda | and would help ; likewise the Kurds ."
"The |0 problem | of mollifying the |1 Sunnis | , though , has to be solved to avoid giving al - |2 Qaeda | an |1 entrée | ."
The |0 Americans | have to put away their free - market |1 fetishism | for a while and find |1 ways | of creating |1 jobs | and pumping |1 money | into Iraqi households .
"|0 We | need an |1 FDR | in Iraq , not a Ronald Reagan ."
"Of course , the sooner the US soldiers can be withdrawn in favor of less - provocative local or international forces , the better ."
Getting the |1 Spanish | out of Iraq is n't nearly as good a rallying cry for al - Qaeda in the Arab world as getting the |1 Americans | and British out .
"The |0 thing | to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab |0 nationalists | and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al - Qaeda infiltrators , and it would be dangerous to take one 's |1 eyes | off the former ball ."
|0 George | W. Bush alleged Thursday that |0 John | Edwards lacks the |1 experience | necessary to be president .
"The |0 problem | with this argument is that |0 Bush | lacked the |1 experience | necessary to be president when |0 he | ran in 2000 , so this |0 sort | of cheap shot just hoists |1 him | by his own petard ."
Let |1 's | just remember a seminal |1 Bush | moment in 1999 :
' |0 Bush | fails reporter 's pop |1 quiz | on international leaders
"November 5 , 1999"
Web posted at : 3:29 p.m. EST ( 2029 GMT )
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
"Texas |0 Gov. | George W. Bush is enduring sharp |1 criticism | for being unable to name the |1 leaders | of four current world hot spots , but |0 President | Bill Clinton says |0 Bush | "" should , and probably will , pick up "" those |1 names | ."
"The front - |0 runner | for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller , a political reporter for WHDH - TV in Boston ."
Bush
"|0 Hiller | asked |1 Bush | to name the |1 leaders | of Chechnya , Taiwan , India and Pakistan ."
"|0 Bush | was only able to give a partial |1 response | to the query on the leader of Taiwan , referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng - hui simply as "" Lee . """
|0 He | could not name the |1 others | .
""" Can |0 you | name the |1 general | |0 who | is in charge of Pakistan ? """
"|0 Hiller | asked , inquiring about Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf , |0 who | seized |1 control | of the country October 12 ."
""" Wait , wait , is |0 this | 50 questions ? "" asked |0 Bush | ."
"|0 Hiller | replied : "" No , |0 it | 's four questions of four leaders in four hot spots . "" . . ."
"|0 Bush | , in answering the |1 question | about the leader of Pakistan , also said : "" The new Pakistani general , he 's just been elected -- not elected , this |0 guy | took over |1 office | ."
"It appears this |0 guy | is going to bring |1 stability | to the country and |0 I | think |0 that | 's good news for the subcontinent . """
|0 Gore | released a |1 statement | Friday taking |1 Bush | to task for his comments on Pakistan 's recent coup .
""" |0 I | find it troubling that a |0 candidate | for president in our country -- the world 's oldest democracy -- would characterize the military |1 takeover | as "" good news , "" |0 Gore | said ."
""" Further , |0 I | find it even more disturbing that |0 he | made these |1 comments | about a nation |0 that | just last year tested nuclear |1 weapons | -- shortly after voicing his public |1 opposition | to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ."
A |0 spokesman | for President Clinton also criticized Bush 's |1 comments | .
""" It is very dangerous for this |0 country | to condone the |1 overthrow | of democratically elected governments , "" said |0 David | Leavy , spokesman for the National Security Council ."
"Not only did |0 Bush | not know who General |0 Pervez | Musharraf was , |0 he | seems to have confused coup - |1 making | with "" taking |1 office | , "" and moreover went on to suggest that the |0 overthrow | of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military , then the world 's strongest supporter of the Taliban , would bring "" |1 stability | ! """
"|0 Musharraf | made his |1 coup | in part because of the military 's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 's willingness to back down from confronting |1 India | over Kashmir , so that |0 he | explicitly came to power as a warmonger ."
|0 I | ca n't tell |1 you | how ominous |0 I | found Bush 's |1 performance | in that interview .
"|0 I | still remember |1 him | stuttering about "" the General , "" unable to remember Musharraf 's |1 name | ."
"|0 He | obviously had no |1 idea | what |0 he | was talking about , though |0 he | demonstrated a |1 number | of ill - fated instincts ."
"|0 He | obviously liked authoritarian |1 rule | better than democracy , equating |1 dictatorship | with "" stability . """
"And , |0 he | did n't think |0 he | needed to know |1 anything | about South Asia , with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics -- the |0 latter | a dire security threat to the US ."
|0 He | could n't tell when |0 things | were becoming more unstable as opposed to less .
"|0 Musharraf | went on to play nuclear |1 brinkmanship | with India in 2002 , risking |1 war | twice that year ."
"Although |0 Musharraf | did turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , |0 elements | of his military continued to support radical |1 Islamism | and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself ."
"|0 This | was the body |1 that | |0 Bush | proclaimed was bringing "" |1 stability | "" to the region in fall of 1999 ."
"So , one |0 answer | to Bush 's charge about Edwards is that if |0 it | had any |1 merit | , |0 Bush | should have declined to run himself ."
Another |0 answer | is that |0 Edwards | certainly knows far |1 more | about foreign affairs now than |0 Bush | did then .
"Indeed , given how |0 Bush | has rampaged around the world alienating |1 allies | and ignoring vital |1 conflicts | with the potential to blow back on the US , |0 one | might well argue that |0 Edwards | knows |1 more | now than |0 Bush | does ."
"|0 This | is what Edwards ' campaign |0 literature | said about his positions : "" |0 Edwards | believes that the |0 U.S. | must be an active leader to help resolve |1 conflicts | , from reducing |1 tensions | between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland ."
"|0 Edwards | is a strong supporter of Israel , and believes that the |0 U.S. | has a vital |1 role | in promoting |1 peace | between the Israelis and the Palestinians . """
|0 I | do n't see |1 Bush | doing |1 any | of this .
From Friday 's Daily Star
By Juan Cole
"Friday , June 04 , 2004"
"As the American |0 public | gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis , |0 some | have begun worrying that the |0 war | could blow back on the US by creating the |1 conditions | for anti-American terrorism ."
"|0 Israel | , however , is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United |0 States | ."
"Ironically , among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime |0 Minister | Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US ."
"Have |0 they | , however , actually weakened Israeli |1 security | ?"
The biggest |0 threat | |0 Israel | faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation movements .
The |0 derailing | of the Oslo peace process by the hard - line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide |1 bombings | .
"|0 This | , in turn , has discouraged international |1 investment | in Israel and has made it less likely that |0 immigrants | to the country will actually remain there ."
"Although |0 Israel | withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000 , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified ."
"It is estimated to have some 5,000 armed |1 fighters | , and |0 they | have pursued |1 attacks | against Israeli forces to compel |1 them | to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of Syrian territory |1 that | |0 Israel | annexed after the 1967 war ."
"Any thorough |0 assessment | of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel 's security environment must , therefore , closely examine its likely |1 effect | on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare ."
"Although it is often alleged ( without much evidence ) that |0 Saddam | Hussein gave |1 money | to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical |1 warfare | , it is not clear that |0 he | actually posed a |1 danger | to Israel ."
The Palestinians |0 who | have been willing to kill |1 themselves | to end the Israeli |1 occupation | of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations .
|0 Saddam | never did |1 anything | practical to help the |1 Palestinians | .
"At some points , as in the late 1980s , |0 he | reportedly made behind - the - scenes |1 overtures | to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal ."
|0 He | did not allow Palestinian |1 radicals | to launch |1 operations | against Israel from Iraq .
"By the late 1990s , |0 Iraq | had no nuclear or biological weapons |1 program | , and had destroyed its chemical weapons |1 stockpiles | ."
Its ramshackle |0 army | had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003 .
"If it is hard to see how Baathist |0 Iraq | posed any real |1 threat | to Israel , it is not so difficult to see a |1 menace | in the current instability ."
The |0 bungling | of post-war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed |1 state | .
"Armed |0 militias | , many staffed by former Iraqi military men with substantial training and experience , have proliferated ."
"The |0 US | chose to ally |1 itself | with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , whose 15,000 - strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards ."
Anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian |0 feeling | is strong among several major Iraqi ideological groups and currents .
"The more radical |0 Shiites | , |0 who | generally follow the theocratic |1 notions | of Iran 's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel ."
"|0 They | vehemently protested the Israeli |1 assassination | of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the leader of Hamas , last March ."
"Worse for Israel , the |0 assassination | drew a |1 denunciation | even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , |0 who | wields enormous moral |1 authority | over Iraqi Shiites ."
"These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein 's regime , but have now organized and armed |1 themselves | ."
|0 They | have also reestablished their historical |1 links | with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites .
"It is inevitable that most Iraqi |0 Shiites | will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel , and it seems likely that Iraqi |0 Shiites | will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that |0 they | will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite |1 radicals | ."
"Sunni Arab |0 fundamentalists | deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas , and |0 those | in Iraq have deep historical |1 inks | with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine ."
"Iraqi |0 cities | such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad , and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement , |0 which | is popular in Jordan ."
"Secular Arab nationalist |0 groups | also universally sympathize with the Palestinians , and |0 those | in post-Saddam Iraq are no exception ."
"Whereas Saddam Hussein 's |0 dictatorship | ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control , |0 they | are now free to organize ."
An |0 Iraq | in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist |0 militias | proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel .
"If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq , its |0 citizens | will be able to benefit from the country 's petroleum reserves ."
That private wealth can easily be funneled into aid for the Palestinians and for Lebanese Shiites .
"Israel 's security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors , which can only be achieved by trading |1 land | for peace with the Palestinians ."
Ariel Sharon 's aggressive near |0 annexation | of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented |1 rage | and violence .

India defensive over Sri Lanka
By Ranjit Devraj
NEW DELHI -
"While |0 India | is ready to enter into a "" defense cooperation agreement "" with Sri Lanka , |0 it | is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation 's two decades - old civil war |0 that | has seen violent |1 strife | between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over |1 60,000 | dead on both sides ."
And |0 that | explains the |1 delay | in the signing of a formal defense agreement |0 that | was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga 's four - day visit to India recently .
"According to Professor S D Muni , South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University , the two - year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) are stalemated ."
"For that reason , |0 he | said , Kumaratunga 's |0 government | was keen to beef up military |1 preparedness | with Indian support ."
""" The Sri Lankan |0 government | does not want to initiate a |1 conflict | but would be interested in deterring the |1 LTTE | from starting |1 one | ."
"And the |0 Tigers | look as if |0 they | are on the brink of launching another |1 offensive | , "" |0 Muni | told |1 IPS | ."
|0 Colombo | held six |1 rounds | of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003 .
"But last April , the |0 rebels | abruptly pulled out of negotiations demanding |1 recognition | , first , for the right to self - rule before proceeding any further ."
Kumaratunga 's India |0 tour | preceded a three - day |1 visit | to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace |1 talks | |0 that | were supposed to follow a |1 ceasefire | |1 that | |0 Oslo | successfully brokered in February 2002 .
"|0 Petersen | held |1 discussions | with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success , and chief Tamil rebel negotiator |0 Anton | Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed - door |1 talks | at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage |1 effort | on track , diplomatic |0 sources | said ."
"But |0 they | , too , failed ."
"|0 Colombo | , too , seems to be in an intractable position ."
"According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat , the |0 difficulty | for Kumaratunga 's government lay in the fact that the |0 LTTE | had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every |1 aspect | of civil administration in the areas within its control ."
A veteran of India 's military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo - Sri Lanka Peace |1 Accord | - |0 which | ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - |0 Kalkat | said the new defense |0 deal | would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .
"|0 Kalkat | , |0 who | currently chairs the independent US - based International |1 Council | on Conflict Resolution , said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the |1 Tigers | , |0 India | remained the only power capable of influencing the |1 course | of the current peace talks ."
""" The |0 Norwegians | mean well but their |0 role | is limited to that of honest broker and the |0 LTTE | is keenly aware that |0 they | do not have the |1 power | [ unlike India ] to underwrite any |1 arrangement | , "" |0 Kalkat | told |1 IPS | in an interview ."
"In 1987 , the Tamil |0 Tigers | reluctantly accepted the peace |1 accord | under Indian pressure ."
"Under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east ."
"However , |0 differences | between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force ."
"About 1,200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict ."
"|0 India | had to pull back its |1 forces | from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation ."
"Last June , an international |0 initiative | led by Japan to persuade the |1 LTTE | to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US$ 4.5 billion ."
"Japan 's special |0 envoy | , Yasushi Akashi , |0 who | called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released , came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man ."
"|0 He | complained about the "" visible lack of progress "" and reaching an |1 impasse | in talks with both sides ."
"The Tigers ' chief |0 ideologue | , Balasingham , sniffed at the proposal saying that "" a solution to the ethnic conflict can not be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences , but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces . """
But there are strong |0 hints | in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense |0 deal | could be in the making .
And |0 this | has already drawn |1 protests | from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
""" |0 Tamils | feel that the proposed defense |0 agreement | between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala |1 rulers | to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace |1 process | , "" TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement ."
"|0 She | added that recent |0 visits | to the island by India 's top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "" caused |1 apprehension | among Tamils that |0 preparations | are under way for another war in the island "" ."
"But |0 Kalkat | pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because |0 it | still had to consider the |1 sentiments | of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka 's Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits ."
"Apart from the 1,200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping |0 force | was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority |0 who | considered |1 it | a violation of their country 's sovereignty ."
"The best |0 option | , now , under the present difficult circumstances is for |0 Colombo | to do its own dirty |1 work | , although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly |1 help | because of the shared belief that |0 religion | , ethnicity and language can not be the basis for secession ."
"In any case , |0 Kalkat | puts it succinctly : "" There can not be a military |0 option | to what is a political situation . """

"Unreported by the international media , the |0 Valley | of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural |1 genocide | |0 that | has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families |0 who | have been living there since human habitation was first recorded ."
"Over nine dozen temples |0 that | had served the Hindu |1 population | have been destroyed , with |0 some | used as building material and others used as urinals ."
"Thus far , |0 none | of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a |1 development | ."
|0 Musharraf | calls the |1 bluff |
M.D. Nalapat
"While most U.S. |0 secretaries | of state -- save perhaps Dean Rusk -- have gobbled up |1 credit | for outcomes |1 that | |0 they | had |1 little | to do with , |0 few | have been as brazen as Colin Powell ."
"Two years ago , Pakistani |0 President | Pervez Musharraf was surprised when the |0 leader | of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visited |1 India | and issued a |1 series | of highly conciliatory statements ."
"As Pakistan 's |0 president | had been telling the United |1 States | he was "" forced "" into taking a hawkish |1 line | on India precisely by the likes of Rahman , |0 this | was an embarrassment ."
The |0 reality | is that |0 India | is no longer the enemy of choice for the people of Pakistan .
That |0 distinction | has now gone to the United States .
"|0 Realists | , and |0 this | even includes |1 members | of the U.S. Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott , |0 who | have long sought to divest |1 India | of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia , understand the only feasible |0 solution | for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo ."
|0 India | keeps |1 what | |0 it | has while |0 Pakistan | and China ( which was gifted a |1 slice | of the territory three decades ago ) do likewise .
"Simultaneously , New |0 Delhi | would ensure a |1 degree | of autonomy for the state |0 that | would help cut popular |1 support | off from jihadis attempting to convert |1 Kashmir | into a second Afghanistan ."
"|0 Bill | Clinton understood |1 this | at the end of his term in office yet , under Colin Powell ( |0 who | appears to have an |1 affinity | for generals active in politics ) , the |0 pendulum | of U.S. policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the |1 Valley | of Kashmir loose from India ."
"|0 This | , Pakistan 's lobbyist in Washington Christina Rocca has been told , is the "" minimum "" |1 that | the Pakistan |0 army | will accept ."
|0 It | is also far more than what any |0 administration | in New Delhi can deliver .
"This |0 writer | has for years regarded the best |1 solution | to the Kashmir problem as being the trifurcation of the Indian part of the state into a Hindu - majority Jammu , a Buddhist - dominated Ladakh and the overwhelmingly Muslim Kashmir Valley , with the third |0 state | given |1 little | of taxpayers ' money but substantial autonomy ."
"With luck , the Kashmir |0 Valley | can attract |1 investment | from the Middle East and other locations where |0 Muslims | are dominant and become a tourist , education and services haven within India ."
"The overwhelming |0 majority | of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome , except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U.S. State Department and the Pakistan Army , |0 which | would like to even the |1 score | with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971 ."
"Unreported by the international media , the |0 Valley | of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural |1 genocide | |0 that | has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families |0 who | have been living there since human habitation was first recorded ."
"Over nine dozen temples |0 that | had served the Hindu |1 population | have been destroyed , with |0 some | used as building material and others used as urinals ."
"Thus far , |0 none | of the many "" human rights "" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a |1 development | ."
"Indeed , their reports are filled with tales of the "" atrocities "" of Indian troops on the innocent jihadis ."
"Despite Sept. 11 , the United |0 States | still supports the Kashmir |1 groups | |0 that | back |1 jihad | as part of the price |0 Washington | is paying to keep Pervez |1 Musharraf | happy ."
"Unfortunately for them , the |0 general | has decided to take seriously Colin Powell 's frequent |1 boasts | that |0 it | was on his nudging that the |0 Indians | made conciliatory |1 gestures | toward Islamabad ."
"The U.S. State |0 Department | and the misnamed think tanks |0 that | follow its |1 lead | have held numerous |1 conferences | on Kashmir and , in most of them , the |0 solution | |0 that | has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova ."
"That |0 India | is not Yugoslavia and that the "" foreigner - led "" Indian National |0 Congress | can least afford to ignore Indian |1 nationalism | , has not struck the |1 conferees | , among whom have been several Indian "" |0 scholars | "" and "" analysts "" ready to say and endorse |1 anything | for the sake of a free trip to New York or Vienna ."
"Despite many wrinkles , |0 India | remains a part - democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper |0 that | calls for an independent Kashmir does not get |1 you | into the trouble that writing an op - ed |1 piece | against Sonia Gandhi or Atal Behari Vajpayee would instantly ."
"It was the business community in India |0 that | stepped in after |0 Vajpayee | indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002 , pointing out that the only |0 beneficiary | of the mythical perception that |0 war | -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China ."
"The |0 reason | for this is that |0 India | is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China , hence the favor |1 that | the |0 generals | in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a |1 scare | about war involving |1 India | when in fact the real |0 flashpoints | are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea ."
"Since then , |0 India | has talked |1 peace | while always signaling that only the status |0 quo | would be acceptable as a final settlement : a line of action that is followed in the case of disputes with China as well ."
"Unfortunately for those eager to indefinitely carry on with the lucrative business of conflict resolution in South Asia , |0 Pervez | Musharraf has now called Colin Powell 's |1 bluff | , challenging |1 him | to deliver on his frequent statements implying that the |0 Indians | jump to his commands ."
"Once the Manmohan Singh |0 government | shows that |0 it | has little |1 appetite | for suicide , |0 Musharraf | will face the |1 moment | of truth : accept the |1 inevitable | , or once again ramp up the |1 insurgency | and spawn a fresh |1 lot | of killers |0 that | can hit not merely |1 Mumbai | and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well ."
The one |0 country | |0 that | has shown that |0 it | understands the |1 realities | in South Asia is China .
"Under President Hu Jintao , |0 Beijing | has opened out to New Delhi and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is expected to visit early next year , making |1 friends | by formally accepting |1 Sikkim | as part of India and backing |1 India | as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council -- thus leaving |1 Washington | as the only one of the "" permanent five "" |0 that | has not yet done so ."
"With Colin Powell around , the |0 U.S. | has no |1 need | of an Osama bin Laden"

Ok .
|0 We | all know that |0 John | Kerry served in Vietnam .
"Four whole months , after which |0 he | took |1 advantage | of a little - known , little - invoked regulation |0 that | allowed |1 him | to desert his "" |1 band | of brothers "" ."
"|0 We | also know how |0 Dan | Rather libeled |1 George | Bush and impugned his |1 service | in the Texas Air National Guard on a "" 60 Minutes II "" report based largely on forged documents ."
"During his time in the Guard , |0 George | Bush flew the F - 102 Delta Dagger fighter - |1 interceptor | ."
The |0 F | - 102 saw |1 service | in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969 .
"During this time , F - 102 squadrons were based out of Tan Son Nhut , Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam , and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand ."
( Click here for source . )
"As far as |0 George | Bush knew , he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam ."
"In all this so - called controversy , has |0 anyone | considered that perhaps |0 George | Bush just wanted to fly |1 jets | ?"
"And , let |1 's | remember , flying supersonic fighter |1 jets | is dangerous !"
|0 They | do n't let just |1 anybody | do |1 it | .
"Some |0 reporters | ( |0 you | know , the ones with journalistic ethics ) have actually uncovered the |1 truth | about George Bush 's service in the Texas Air National Guard ."
"For example , did |0 you | know that |0 George | Bush spent considerably more |1 time | in uniform than John Kerry ?"
|0 What | |0 follows | is the text of an e-mail sent to me by a friend of mine ( thanks to Dave Manzano ) .
Read on to learn the |1 facts | .

Bush ’s National Guard years
"Before |0 you | fall for Dems ’ spin , here are the |0 facts |"
|1 What | do |0 you | really know about George W. Bush ’s time in the Air National Guard ?
That |0 he | did n’t show up for duty in Alabama ?
That |0 he | missed a |1 physical | ?
That his |0 daddy | got |1 him | in ?
News |0 coverage | of the president ’s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else .
"So just for the record , here , in full , is |1 what | |0 Bush | did :"
The future |0 president | joined the |1 Guard | in May 1968 .
"Almost immediately , |0 he | began an extended |1 period | of training ."
Six weeks of basic training .
Fifty - three weeks of flight training .
Twenty - one weeks of fighter - interceptor training .
"|0 That | was 80 weeks to begin with , and there were other training |0 periods | thrown in as well ."
|0 It | was full - time work .
"By the time |0 it | was over , |0 Bush | had served nearly two years ."
Not two years of weekends .
Two years .
"After training , |0 Bush | kept flying , racking up |1 hundreds | of hours in F - 102 jets ."
"As |0 he | did , |0 he | accumulated |1 points | toward his National Guard service requirements ."
"At the time , guardsmen were required to accumulate a |1 minimum | of 50 points to meet their yearly |1 obligation | ."
"According to records released earlier this year , |0 Bush | earned 253 |1 points | in his first year , May 1968 to May 1969 ( since |0 he | joined in May 1968 , his service thereafter was measured on a May - to - May basis ) ."
|0 Bush | earned 340 |1 points | in 1969 - 1970 .
"[ In other words , |0 Bush | earned enough |1 points | to satisfy the |1 requirements | for his entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone ."
- acd ]
|0 He | earned 137 |1 points | in 1970 - 1971 .
And |0 he | earned 112 |1 points | in 1971 - 1972 .
"The |0 numbers | indicate that in his first four years , |0 Bush | not only showed up , |0 he | showed up a lot ."
Did |0 you | know |1 that | ?
"|0 That | brings the |1 story | to May 1972 — the time |0 that | has been the focus of so many news reports — when |0 Bush | “ deserted ” ( according to anti-Bush filmmaker Michael Moore ) or went “ AWOL ” ( according to Terry McAuliffe , chairman of the Democratic National Committee ) ."
|0 Bush | asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign .
His superior |0 officers | said |1 OK | .
"|0 Requests | like that were n’t unusual , says retired |0 Col. | William Campenni , |0 who | flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971 ."
"“ In 1972 , there was an enormous |0 glut | of pilots , ” |0 Campenni | says ."
"“ The Vietnam |0 War | was winding down , and the Air |0 Force | was putting |1 pilots | in desk jobs ."
"In ’72 or ’73 , if |0 you | were a pilot , active or Guard , and |0 you | had an |1 obligation | and wanted to get out , no problem ."
"In fact , |0 you | were helping |1 them | solve their |1 problem | . ”"
So |0 Bush | stopped flying .
"From May 1972 to May 1973 , |0 he | earned just 56 |1 points | — not much , but enough to meet his |1 requirement | ."
"Then , in 1973 , as |0 Bush | made |1 plans | to leave the |1 Guard | and go to Harvard Business School , |0 he | again started showing up frequently ."
"In June and July of 1973 , |0 he | accumulated 56 |1 points | , enough to meet the minimum |1 requirement | for the 1973 - 1974 year ."
"Then , at his request , he was given |1 permission | to go ."
"|0 Bush | received an honorable |1 discharge | after serving five |1 years | , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment ."
"By that time , however , |0 he | had accumulated enough |1 points | in each year to cover six |1 years | of service ."
"During his service , |0 Bush | received high |1 marks | as a pilot ."
A 1970 |0 evaluation | said |0 Bush | “ clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot ” and was “ a natural leader whom his |0 contemporaries | look to for leadership . ”
A 1971 |0 evaluation | called |1 Bush | “ an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot ” |0 who | “ continually flies intercept |1 missions | with the unit to increase his |1 proficiency | even further . ”
And a 1972 |0 evaluation | called |1 Bush | “ an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer . ”
"Now , it is only natural that news |0 reports | questioning Bush ’s |1 service | — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times , on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now ."
|0 Democrats | are spitting mad over attacks on John Kerry ’s record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
"And , as it is with Kerry , it ’s reasonable to look at a candidate ’s entire record , including his military service — or lack of it ."
|0 Voters | are perfectly able to decide whether |0 it | ’s important or not in November .
"The |0 Kerry | camp blames |1 Bush | for the Swift boat veterans ’ attack , but |0 anyone | |0 who | has spent much |1 time | talking to the Swifties gets the |1 sense | that |0 they | are doing |1 it | entirely for their own reasons ."
"And it should be noted in passing that |0 Kerry | has personally questioned Bush ’s |1 service | , while |0 Bush | has not personally questioned |1 Kerry | ’s ."
"In April — before the Swift boat |0 veterans | had said a |1 word | — |0 Kerry | said |0 Bush | “ has yet to explain to America whether or not , and tell the |1 truth | , about whether |0 he | showed up for duty . ”"
"Earlier , |0 Kerry | said , “ Just because |0 you | get an honorable |1 discharge | does not , in fact , answer that |1 question | . ”"
"Now , after the Swift boat episode , the |0 spotlight | has returned to Bush ."
|0 That | ’s fine .
|0 We | should know as |1 much | as |0 we | can .
And perhaps someday |0 Kerry | will release |1 more | of his military records as well .
|0 Byron | York is a White House correspondent for National Review .
His |0 column | appears in The Hill each week .
"One week to elections day and the general |0 atmosphere | in the capital is eerie , yet strikingly familiar ."
|0 I | suspect the |0 streets | of Baghdad will look as if a |0 war | is looming this week .
"There is no |0 doubt | that many |0 Iraqis | regard the |1 date | of 30 January as a day of renewed hope , one |0 they | have been awaiting all their lives , but at the same time , many |0 others | are already dreading |1 it | ."
"The interim |0 government | has promised security |1 measures | |0 that | would reduce the |1 violence | on the day of elections , but |0 I | fail to see how |0 they | will be able to protect all 5,000 ( or so ) balloting |1 centres | ."
Many voting centres have already been successfully attacked or destroyed in many areas .
"Now that the |0 picture | is clear , the two main competing |0 lists | seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi 's Al - Iraqiya list ."
"|0 Ayad | Allawi , and other ministers running on his list , have quite expectedly used their governmental |1 positions | in campaigning ."
"One |0 minister | reportedly handed out 100 dollar ' |1 gifts | ' to journalists attending a press |1 conference | for Allawi , a practice |0 that | brings back bad |1 memories | to many Iraqis ."
"Sheikh |0 Naji | Al - Abbudi , a spokesman for Sistani , affirmed the |1 claims | that the Grand |0 Ayatollah | is backing the United Iraqi Coalition |1 list | ."
"Indeed , Sistani 's |0 agents | all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi |1 Shia | on the merits of elections , |0 which | has led to the assassination of at least two of them ."
"|0 Al | - Abbudi stated that "" His |0 Emminence | "" decided to openly support the |1 list | because "" |0 others | "" ( obviously a reference to Allawi ) have been abusing official state |1 positions | and media outlets in their campaigning ."
"Again there is no official written |0 statement | from Sistani 's office confirming this |1 allegation | , |1 which | |0 I | think is intentional ."
|0 Ahmed | Al - Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al - Sha'lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media .
"|0 Chalabi | describing |1 Sha'lan | as a "" Ba'athist "" and a "" former double agent for Saddam and the CIA "" , while |0 Sha'lan | dismisses |1 Chalabi | as a "" thief "" and an "" Iranian stooge |0 who | longs for his own origins by defending |1 Iran | "" ."
"One |0 remark | made by Sha'lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that |0 he | could n't say |1 more | about Chalabi because |0 he | would embarrass |1 himself | and the viewers almost made |0 me | roll on the floor ."
"|0 It | was an extremely amusing episode , watching |1 Chalabi | looking smug and amused , contrasted with Sha'lan , all serious and barely keeping |1 himself | from swearing ."
"Fistfights , please ."
"|0 Hazim | Al - Sha'lan , by the way , is the son of the late Sheikh of Al - Khaza'il in Diwaniya and has the |1 potential | to replace former information minister , |1 M.S. | Al - Sahaf , in his nonsensical media statements , which can be passed as jokes ."
The main Kurdish coalition list ( PUK and KDP ) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region .
"Even there , many |0 Kurds | look and act as if |0 they | are going to grab the |1 chance | to vote |1 them | out of power ."
|0 I | doubt |0 that | will be the outcome though .
"Many |0 Iraqis | , including conservative and religious Iraqis , are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party , probably in an attempt to counter the |1 influence | of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly ."
The Communist |0 party | has the largest |1 number | of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq .
Its support |0 base | is much larger than |1 what | |0 it | seems .
***
"Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks , others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the |1 example | of the Islamic party ."
"Sectarian |0 tensions | are at their highest since April , 2004 , with Sunni |0 insurgents | now openly attacking |1 Husseiniyas | and Shia mosques ."
"|0 I | had an interesting |1 conversation | with a middle - aged taxi driver |0 who | used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya , Baghdad ."
"After asking |1 me | which tribe |0 I | belong to ( thus assessing my sectarian |1 background | ) |0 he | started hurling |1 abuses | at the Shia , calling |1 them | Persians , Majoos ( fire worshippers ) , rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions |1 that | |0 I | ca n't mention here ."
|0 He | described Allawi 's |1 face | as that of a f*ed horse and |0 he | dismissed the whole |1 government | as a band of thieves and traitors .
|0 I | did n't argue with him but |0 I | asked |1 him | |0 what | |0 he | believed would be a viable solution to this mess .
|0 He | said that |0 resistance | was the only commonsense solution .
"First driving out the |1 Americans | , then fighting the |1 Shia | back into submission ( as in 1991 ) ."
Sunni |0 Iraqis | contend that |0 elections | are impossible to hold under occupation .
"Leaving aside the |1 fact | that this |0 views | conflicts with other historical examples in the region , |0 Sunnis | have never offered an alternative |1 choice | , |0 which | eventually leads |1 one | to guess that the |0 opinion | held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely |1 what | |0 they | are planning to implement ."
|0 I | had another |1 conversation | some months ago with a retired Ba'athist old - timer |0 who | claimed that |0 Ba'athists | have the |1 means | to stage a third coup |1 d'etat | and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal .
"On sensing my |1 incredulity | to his statement |0 he | asserted that Ba'athist |0 cells | exist in all parts of the country and that |0 they | do have a central |1 command | , even though |0 many | have formed seperate |1 cells | ( often under Islamic labels ) with their own leaderships ."
|0 He | said that |0 they | have the |1 training | and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments .
"|0 I | concur that |0 Ba'athists | and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least |1 5 | out of 18 governorates , along with the capital , if |0 Americans | are to be removed from the picture entirely ."
"But |0 I | also see |1 that | as a fatal misconception , |0 which | is doing |2 Sunnis | |1 harm | , because |0 I | do n't believe the |0 US | is going anywhere so soon ."
"Any |0 government | |0 that | assumes |1 power | after the elections also realises |1 this | , so not even |0 Sistani | is going to call the |1 US | to withdraw its |1 troops | , despite what |0 he | is saying now , not until they are ensured the |0 insurgency | is out of the picture , or that |0 they | have an alternative foreign |1 power | ( in this case Iran ) to back |1 them | up ."
"The only |0 hope | now is that , following the elections , the National |0 Assembly | would offer the |1 hand | of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties ."
"|0 I | would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics , since |0 they | have the upper |1 hand | in their areas and can effectively root out any |1 Ba'athists | in their midst in return for a promise of sharing |1 power | and authority ."
Many of these Sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years .
"Very recently , US |0 forces | in Al - Anbar made a terrible |1 blunder | by accidentally killing |1 Abdul | - Razaq Inad Al - Gu'ud , Sheikh of the Al - Bu Nimr clan from the powerful Dulaym tribe ."
|0 Al | - Gu'ud had favoured |1 elections | and was in good terms with the government .
The Gu'ud |0 family | even accepted to be offered the |1 seat | of Al - Anbar governor some months back .
"The Al - Bu |0 Nimr | in Ramadi and Al - Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid-nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al - Dulaymi , an Air Force general belonging to their tribe ."
The |0 revolt | took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard .
"Another bad |0 step | was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al - Lihabi , of the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of Al - Anbar , Mosul and Salah Al - Din ."
|0 Al | - Lihaibi was running in elections and is now said to have withdrawn following this incident .
|0 I | believe national |1 reconciliation | to be the only path forward to a new Iraq .
"The |0 Shia | can not live without the Sunnis , and vice versa ."
|0 Both | have shared this |1 country | for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible |0 way | that |0 one | can live without the other .
"Even |0 partition | is not a possibility , there are no clear |0 borders | between the two ."
Remember |1 Luis | Posada Carriles ?
"Here 's a Miami Herald |0 interview | with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo , published yesterday ."
"( "" At first |0 I | hid a lot ."
|0 I | thought the US |0 government | was looking for me .
"Now |0 I | hide a lot less . "" )"
"Because of such talk , Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials ."
|0 I | ca n't imagine |0 they | wanted to do |1 this | .
|0 Authorities | would likely have been happy answering |1 questions | about Posada 's whereabouts with an indefinite shrug .
As recently as last week the official |0 line | stated |0 they | had no |1 knowledge | |0 he | had entered the |1 country | .
"But comfortable among the thugs , |0 Posada | overplayed his |1 hand | and embarrassed his old |1 patron | , the US government ."
"And though |0 he | 'd been a faithful servant , |0 he | was not such a player that |0 he | could get away with that ."
"|0 He | should have taken a |1 cue | from another bomber some pesky dark - skinned |0 foreigners | want extradited , CIA operative Michael Meiring ."
"|0 Posada | should have told any inquisitive |2 journalist | at his doorstep |1 something | like |0 Meiring | told the single American |1 reporter | |0 who | bothered following his bloody |1 trail | from the Philippines , that "" If |0 this | harms |1 me | in any way , |0 you | will find my |1 power | then , and |0 you | 'll find out who |0 I | am . """
"But then , maybe |0 that | would n't have saved |1 him | either , because |0 Posada | is not Meiring ."
"Posada can be given up , but |0 Meiring | ca n't ."
"Meiring 's |0 crimes | are fresh , and wave the false |1 flag | |0 which | is the "" War on Terror . """
"|0 They | happened in the Philippines |0 which | , like Pakistan , is an important and vulnerable node for the business |1 which | intelligence |0 agencies | and terrorist organizations conduct with each other ."
( Ask |1 Terry | Nichols about the Philippines . )
"The |0 bombings | implicated |1 Muslims | , and exacerbated regional |1 tensions | |1 which | the |0 Bush | regime and its friends wearing the |1 brass | in the Philippine military sought to exploit ."
"Posada 's |0 crimes | , on the other hand , must seem like ancient history , especially to a people |0 who | do n't know their |1 history | ."
"And to those |0 who | do n't even know their |1 crimes | , not even that ."
But will Posada be given up ?
"|0 I | doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela , |0 which | is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes ."
"|0 I | expect it will be determined that , under "" Strong Man "" Hugo Chavez , Posada could not be guaranteed a fair |1 trial | ."
The |0 hope | may be that Posada can soon be offered to a post-Chavez Allawi - like puppet in Caracas .
Whether such an offer were accepted or declined would make no |1 difference | ; justice would not be served then .
"But |0 Posada | 's nearly 80 years old , and the Venezuelan |0 people | will ensure |0 that | 's a vain hope ."
"So instead Posada may be held indefinitely , in comfortable custody ."
"An embarrassment to the US still , just not as embarrassing as having the old |0 killer | strut about Miami , gloating in his freedom ."
|0 Meiring | is more than an embarrassment .
"His |0 case | threatens the consensus |1 fiction | of the "" War on Terror . """
So his |0 name | will remain unspoken .
"Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling - dating from the 1980s - is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot , by Jack Terrell ."
"|0 Terrell | , a CIA asset originally recruited for the Contra effort , identifies the |1 man | attempting to recruit |1 him | into the Philippine scheme as Oliver North ..."
|0 I | seem to recall the |0 object | was to smuggle |1 explosives | .
http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0915765381/701-3377456-8181939
"|0 I | 've read the |1 book | - |0 it | 's a first person memoir with the ring of truth , especially since so |0 much | of the wider context has confirmed the |1 allegations | of Contra drug connections |0 that | led to |0 Terrell | becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group |0 that | ran |1 interference | for the Contra effort , staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North , Robert Owen , Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell ."
|0 Peter | Dale Scott includes an |1 account | of how Terrell 's whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics .
"... same ole , same ole ..."
"Due to the |0 Judge | in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA |0 agent | could not testify using a |1 pseudonym | , therefore opening |1 him | to cross-examination by Wilson , the |0 prosecution | had a |1 problem | ."
|0 They | needed |1 someone | |0 that | could convince the |1 jury | |0 they | had been able to see all relevant |1 documents | in CIA files on Wilson .
|0 Wilson | was claiming that |0 he | had been working for the CIA when |0 he | sold the |1 C | - 4 to Quaddaffi .
The |0 prosecution | was charging |0 he | was a rogue using his |1 contacts | from former service in both CIA and the ' Office of Naval Intelligence ' .
"|0 Wilson | had been able to show that |0 he | 'd had more than 80 "" non-social |1 contacts | "" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971 , leaving the prosecution 's |1 case | in turmoil ."
Then |0 Charles | A. Briggs came to the rescue .
"Third ranking CIA officer , |0 Briggs | signed a |1 declaration | on February 3rd , 1983 , that on November 8th , 1982 , |0 he | had authorized a |1 search | of CIA records "" for any material |0 that | in any way pertains to Edwin P.

"The Briggs |0 Declaration | states that with one exception in 1972 , |0 Wilson | did not work "" directly or indirectly "" for the CIA since retiring ."

"+ As the |0 implications | of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian |0 intelligence | has inevitably come under scrutiny ."
"In recent months , its |0 fallibility | has become evident ."
"The |0 inability | to foresee in advance the assassination |1 attempt | on the pro-India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his |1 government | and imposing a virtual absolute |1 monarchy | , are glaring examples of intelligence failure . +"
Trouble on India 's islands
Ramtanu Maitra
"In early February , |0 India | charged 34 Arakan |1 separatists | from Myanmar with hiding in the Landfall Islands , part of the Andaman Islands group ( see end |1 note | ) ."
"These alleged members of the Arakan Army , the military wing of the National Unity Party in Myanmar , have been charged with illegal entry ."
"It is likely , but not certain , that they will be deported to Myanmar ."
But the |0 news | of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when |0 it | comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands .
|0 Reports | are circulating in the intelligence community that the Andaman |0 Islands | are not only thick with Myanmar rebels .
"It has also become an arms depot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , |0 who | operate almost freely in the Andaman Sea ."
"|0 Information | pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami , |0 which | took a heavy |1 toll | on the Andamans ."
"|0 Correspondents | |0 who | flocked in to cover the |1 tsunami | found |0 they | also had another |1 story | - the miserable security situation surrounding the Indian navy 's Far Eastern Naval |1 Command | , now being established along with India 's "" blue water navy "" ."
Deteriorating security
"Security |0 problems | in the Andaman Sea are not new , but |0 they | have deteriorated during the past few years , in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh , Nepal and Bhutan , and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur , Nagaland and Tripura ."
"While the Indian |0 army | has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the |1 capability | of withstanding any Pakistani |1 adventure | in that sector , |0 it | has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its |0 enemy | is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh ."
"The Andaman |0 Sea | is a major conduit for this traffic , and the 572 large and small |0 islands | |0 that | constitute the Andaman and Nicobar |1 group | are a natural transit base ."
The |0 drugs | and arms travel in all directions .
"Since the "" Sea |0 Tigers | "" of the LTTE , better known as the Tamil Tigers , are the ones |0 who | rule the Andaman |1 Sea | : |0 they | carry the |1 arms | and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa ."
It is old news that the Tamil |0 Tigers | have developed a strong |1 network | within South Africa .
|0 This | is not unknown to New Delhi .
"A recent |0 report | by a journalist from Port Blair , in the Andamans , quoted an unnamed |1 official | saying that |0 foreigners | from Myanmar , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settled in the islands , using fake Indian ration |1 cards | , while |0 citizens | of Thailand , China , Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to plunder the natural |1 resources | and leave ."
""" Port Blair , Havelock Islands , Diglipur , Middle Nicobar , Campbell 's Bay , Neil Islands and Rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners , "" |0 he | said ."
"An official |0 estimate | issued in 2003 suggests there are 50,000 "" |0 foreigners | "" in the Andaman Islands , but unofficial |0 figures | are much higher than this ."
"A large |0 number | of them are Bangladeshis , |0 who | like millions of their countrymen have left their densely populated |1 homeland | to settle elsewhere ."
"As |0 most | of them have few technical |1 skills | , and the |0 Andamans | have little |1 demand | for them in any case , |0 they | turn to smuggling and other unlawful activities ."
"The |0 presence | of the Sea Tigers in the area with guns , cash and drugs makes the |1 situation | extremely dangerous ."
"|0 Reports | from Port Blair make it evident that New |0 Delhi | gets little on - the - ground |1 intelligence | , and the Indian Coast |0 Guard | is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands ."
"One unnamed naval officer was quoted saying , "" Arms |0 smuggling | is a very profitable business in this region . """
"Considering the islands ' huge strategic |1 importance | , it is amazing how |0 lax | New |0 Delhi | has been ."
"These |0 islands | sit aside the vital sea lanes of the Strait of Malacca , through which 300 |0 tankers | and merchant ships pass daily , bringing in |1 oil | for the Far East and Southeast Asia ."
Intelligence lapses
"As the |0 implications | of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , Indian |0 intelligence | has inevitably come under scrutiny ."
"In recent months , its |0 fallibility | has become evident ."
"The |0 inability | to foresee in advance the assassination |1 attempt | on the pro-India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent "" coup "" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his |1 government | and imposing a virtual absolute |1 monarchy | , are glaring examples of intelligence failure ."
"With growing economic and military power , |0 India | will be dependent on smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional |1 security | ."
"Unless New |0 Delhi | does better in providing |1 security | to its own nationals against rebels , secessionists , drug runners and arms traffickers , |0 it | will not generate much |1 confidence | in the capitals of surrounding nations ."
"In fact , |0 it | would tend to encourage more organized anti-India |1 outfits | , such as the Pakistani Inter- Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and outside - linked Maoists , to exploit these |1 networks | and weaken India 's eastern |1 flank | ."
Indian intelligence 's lackluster |0 performance | in dealing with the LTTE is startling .
"This formidable |0 enemy | , |0 which | gave the Indian |2 army | a black |1 eye | in the mid-1980s , has been operating in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time ."
"In 2001 , according to Indian army officials , security |0 forces | launched a wide - ranging |1 operation | in the 300 - some inhabited islands neighboring |1 Andaman | and Nicobar , and found huge |1 caches | of arms ."
"The arms were said to belong to the LTTE and "" other terrorist groups "" ."
The search - and - destroy operation was carried out by the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo .
"In addition , LTTE |0 activity | in the Andaman Sea is well known to local observers ."
The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in the now - defunct Asiaweek in 2001 .
"A |0 shipment | of weapons , ammunition and explosives , believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth several million |1 dollars | , left the |1 port | of Phuket in Thailand in early February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex - Joux 3 ."
"As is LTTE standard procedure , the |0 vessel | changed its |1 name | at sea to Horizon ."
On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa - based spy planes of India 's Aviation Research Center ; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka 's east coast .
LTTE arms - running
"In 1997 , the Thai |0 navy | reported the |1 interception | of a 16 - meter boat after a chase off the Thai port of Ranong , and the confiscation of two tons of weapons and ammunition ."
"Among the weapons intercepted were two rocket - propelled - grenade |0 launchers | , 20 assault rifles , M - 79 grenade launchers and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition ."
"Four persons were arrested , reportedly belonging to the Manipur Revolutionary People 's Front ."
Six crew |0 members | were from the Arakan region of Myanmar .
The |0 boat | was heading toward Cox 's Bazar in Bangladesh .
"Until 1995 the |0 LTTE | maintained a |1 base | at Twante , an island off the coat of Myanmar , west of the Andaman islands ."
"Subsequently , |0 Phuket | became the LTTE 's main backup base ."
A Sri Lanka - born Tamil with a Norwegian passport was arrested by Thai authorities in 2000 for his links with the LTTE .
"At the time of his arrest , the |0 suspect | was allegedly involved in constructing a "" |1 submarine | "" in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast ."
Steady buildup
The real |0 threat | to the Andaman Islands is the steady building - up of ports and conduits |0 that | serve the Tamil |1 Tigers | and a host of less - strong militant groups .
"Over the past decade , |0 Bangladesh | has steadily moved into a state of lawlessness ."
"A |0 number | of extremist groups , under the cover of the Islamist movement , have become active in drug trafficking , gun running and anti-Indian activities ."
"It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani |0 ISI | has nurtured a |1 number | of extremist Islamist groups , such as the Harkat - ul - Jehad - al - Islami , in the port city of Chittagong , and put a |1 number | of secessionist rebels from India 's northeast in touch with this terrorist network ."
"As a result , north of the Andaman Islands , Bangladeshi coastal |0 areas | have become a nest of terrorists involved in the shipment of drugs and arms ."
"A |0 pattern | of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the LTTE from Laos , Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong , from where they are transported northward by land to Bhutan ."
"The |0 route | from Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox 's Bazar passes through northern Bengal , Assam and Meghalaya , and on into Chittagong ."
Note
"India 's Andaman and Nicobar |0 Islands | comprise more than 500 |1 islands | lying 1,000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal ."
"Stretching 750 |1 kilometers | from end to end , |0 they | reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia ."
"The Ten Degree |0 Channel | divides the |1 Andamans | , |0 which | are the larger and more heavily populated northern islands , from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south ."
"On South Andaman , the most heavily populated |0 island | , is Port Blair , |0 which | is the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago ."
"|0 Travel | to the Nicobar Islands is forbidden to non-Indians , and they are also not allowed in some parts of South Andaman Island ."
|0 Ramtanu | Maitra writes for a number of international journals and is a regular contributor to the Washington - based EIR and the New Delhi - based Indian Defense Review .
"|0 He | also writes for Aakrosh , India 's defense - tied quarterly journal ."
[ |0 Karzai | also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
|0 Islamabad | accuses New |1 Delhi | of using its |1 consulates | in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi |1 insurgents | |0 who | are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
Pakistani |0 officials | claim there are as many as 42 RAW |0 agents | based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad .
"“ There have no |1 business | being there unless |0 they | are undermining |1 Pakistan | , ’’ says a Pakistani |0 official | ."
Both |0 India | and Afghanistan deny the |1 claim | .
"‘’ Should |0 Pakistan | show |2 us | any |1 evidence | of an Indian hand using Afghan |1 soil | to work against our neighbours |0 we | will take it very seriously , ” says |0 Amrullah | Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’s National Security Directorate . ]"
"Karzai , Musharraf new regional equations"
KABUL :
"For the past 25 years landlocked |0 Afghanistan | has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan , Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers - Russia and India ."
"The |0 neighbours | are still interfering , but there are |0 signs | that rather than undermining Afghanistan ’s |1 stability | |0 they | may now be trying to strengthen |1 it | ."
"“ The |0 elections | should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable |0 Afghanistan | , a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all ."
"|0 Nobody | should feel a |1 looser | in Afghanistan , ’’ |0 President | Hamid Karzai told Pakistan ’s English |1 daily | The Nation ."
"All the regional |0 countries | have publicly backed the |1 Karzai | government and supported the electoral |1 process | , but serious |0 undercurrents | remain as |0 they | all have their favourite |1 contenders | in Afghanistan ."
"Since September 11 , Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban |1 extremists | |0 who | had pledged to disrupt the |1 elections | , but at the highest level the |0 US | has avoided criticising |1 President | Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that |0 he | is helping the |0 US | catch Al Qaeda |1 elements | inside Pakistan ."
"|0 That | changed on September 22 when |0 President | George W. Bush , Musharraf and Karzai held a three way |1 meeting | in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly ."
The meeting was pushed together by the CIA and the US Defence Department |0 who | were desperately anxious to secure a peaceful |1 election | in Afghanistan and the non-interference of alleged Pakistani backed Taliban .
"Western and Afghan |0 diplomats | intimately involved with the meeting , said |0 Bush | pushed |1 Musharraf | hard on reigning in the |1 Taliban | so the |0 elections | could take |1 place | peacefully ."
"‘’ Where are |0 Mullah | Omar , Mullah Usmani and Gulbuddin Hikmetar ? ’’"
Bush is reported to have asked a flustered |1 Musharraf | .
All |0 three | are extremist Taliban or their allies and known to be living in Pakistan .
"( |0 Mullah | Omar is leader of the Taliban , |0 Usmani | is the former corps commander of Kandahar under the Taliban regime and now a commander of Taliban forces while |0 Hikmetyar | heads the extremist Hizb - e - |1 Islami | . )"
"‘’ |0 It | was the first time that |0 Bush | totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis , ’’ says a Western |0 diplomat | ."
"‘’ Bush was very well briefed before the meeting , ’’ the |0 diplomat | said ."
"An Afghan |0 official | at the meeting added , ‘’ The |0 Americans | now realise that the |0 Taliban | are a bigger threat to our security than Al Qaeda . ’’"
|0 Karzai | was clearly pleased at the results .
"‘’ |0 President | Musharraf promised to help |1 us | and cooperate with us on curbing terrorist |1 activity | by the Taliban , ’’ says |0 Karzai | ."
"The next day an angry |0 Musharraf | categorically said that |0 Pakistan | would not send Pakistani |1 troops | to Iraq , a clear snub to the Americans ."
Until then |0 he | had said Pakistan ’s |0 options | were open .
However Pakistani |0 officials | insist that the |0 decision | was unconnected to the tripartite meeting .
US and NATO military |0 officers | in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush ’s tough |0 message | was instrumental in persuading |1 Musharraf | and the ISI to pressure the |1 Taliban | to restrain from disrupting the |1 elections | .
However there were visible |0 signs | of a crackdown on the Pakistan side .
"‘’ |0 Pakistan | now has a large |1 force | deployed in Baluchistan |0 which | was not there before , ’’ says Lt. General |0 David | Barno ."
"‘’ There is much better tactical |0 cooperation | between our forces on both sides of the border , but the |0 movement | of Taliban still goes on both ways , ’’ |0 he | adds ."
Also several days before the elections |0 Pakistan | closed the border crossing |1 point | at Chaman in Baluchistan |0 which | is a key entry point for the Taliban into Afghanistan .
However US military |0 officers | say regular army |0 officers | - many of them Pashtun - leading |1 units | of the Frontier Corps |0 who | are on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mullahs of the JUI .
At the same time the |0 US | remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout |1 which | the |0 army | is facing in its operations in Waziristan .
"Not only is the |0 army | facing serious political |1 fallout | , growing anti-Americanism and anti-army feeling in the tribal areas but |0 it | is also taking heavy |1 casualties | - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March ."
|0 Musharraf | has always maintained that the |0 US | has never provided actionable |1 intelligence | about Taliban leaders hiding in Baluchistan .
|0 That | too may change .
US and Afghan |0 intelligence | will shortly be presenting the |1 ISI | with a list of Taliban extremists and their suspected whereabouts .
"Moreover there are now major covert |0 attempts | under way to try and bring back to Kabul leading Taliban |1 commanders | , |0 who | have been living quietly in Pakistan and have taken no |1 part | in the Taliban insurgency ."
"With the Taliban failure to disrupt the Afghan |1 elections | , the |0 militants | are even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban |0 who | want to return home ."
Until now |0 Pakistan | has not facilitated such a |1 return | and clearly |0 it | can not happen until there is both a |0 pull | from Kabul and a push from Islamabad .
"With |0 President | Karzai certain to win the |1 elections | and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan , there is now little |0 reason | for moderate Taliban |0 leaders | to fear |1 reprisals | from former Northern Alliance figures if |0 they | return home ."
Their |0 removal | should also provide increased |1 motivation | for |0 Pakistan | to help the |1 return | of moderate Taliban .
Afghan |0 officials | welcomed the |1 appointment | on October 3 of Lt. General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief .
Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year |0 he | led the Pakistani |1 delegation | in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues .
|0 Karzai | also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
|0 Islamabad | accuses New |1 Delhi | of using its |1 consulates | in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi |1 insurgents | |0 who | are active in Pakistani Balochistan .
Pakistani |0 officials | claim there are as many as 42 RAW |0 agents | based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad .
"“ |0 There | have no |1 business | being there unless |0 they | are undermining |1 Pakistan | , ’’ says a Pakistani |0 official | ."
Both |0 India | and Afghanistan deny the |1 claim | .
"‘’ Should |0 Pakistan | show |2 us | any |1 evidence | of an Indian hand using Afghan |1 soil | to work against our neighbours |0 we | will take it very seriously , ” says |0 Amrullah | Saleh the head of Afghanistan ’s National Security Directorate ."
|0 Karzai | categorically said that |0 he | has assured |1 Musharraf | repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly .
Senior US |0 diplomats | and military officials have warned |1 India | also .
"In a major regional shift reflecting the newly strengthened |1 position | of Karzai , |0 Iran | , Russia and India |0 which | have traditionally backed the Tajik dominated former Northern |1 Alliance | made strenuous |1 efforts | to convince presidential candidate |1 Younis | Qanooni to strike a |1 deal | with Karzai before the elections and not to oppose |1 Karzai | ."
|0 Iran | in particular feared that |0 Qanooni | would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream .
|0 Qanooni | refused to accept the Iranian |1 advice | as his fellow Panjsheri |0 Tajiks | urged |1 him | to stand against Karzai .
However since the elections Iranian |0 influence | has proved critical in convincing the Hazara Shia |1 candidate | Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the |1 results | of the elections and later convincing |1 Qanooni | to do the |1 same | .
"With the US military |0 presence | posing a |1 threat | on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan , Iran ’s moderate |0 leadership | is keen to help stabilise |1 Karzai | so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced ."
However powerful |0 hardliners | in Tehran may be trying to undermine that |1 strategy | and a new |0 issue | is likely to deepen the |1 rift | with the moderates .
"Iranian |0 officials | are deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand , a massive Soviet - era airbase just 30 kilometres from Iran ’s border ."
"The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan , the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month , |0 who | was a close ally of Iranian hardliners ."
Iranian |0 officials | say |0 they | made no |1 objections | to Khan ’s ouster because |0 they | want to strengthen Karzai ’s |1 campaign | against warlords .
"At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran ’s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo-conservatives in Washington that a second |0 Bush | term should deal with Iran aggressively , the |0 Iranians | fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post , spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran ."
Afghan |0 officials | say the |0 Americans | have moved over 100 Special |1 Forces | and helicopters to Shindand .
However General |0 Barno | insists the US |0 presence | poses no |1 threat | to Iran .
"‘’ |0 We | have a very small |1 number | of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters , ’’ says |0 Barno | ."
Nevertheless |0 this | places |1 Karzai | in a difficult and sensitive situation because |0 he | has to maintain excellent |1 relations | with both the US and Iran .
‘’ |0 Afghanistan | has had the |1 benefit | of cooperation from both the US and Iran .
"So far |1 what | |0 they | have done together has been good for us and |0 that | ’s how |0 we | would like to keep |1 it | ’’ , says |0 Karzai | ."
"|0 Nobody | can claim that the |0 interference | of Afghanistan ’s neighbours is over , but the |0 elections | will do |1 much | to strengthen |1 Karzai | and deal more firmly with neighbours ’ interference ."
In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the |0 Taliban | do not have the |1 support | of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns .
"In a highly significant move Afghan Pashtun |0 tribes | along the Pakistan border warned the |1 Taliban | in Quetta and Chaman that if |0 they | try and disrupt the |1 elections | , they would be resisted ."
Many |0 Taliban | living in Afghanistan voted for President Karzai .
"It is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan , the demise of key Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan , |0 Pakistan | should reconsider its |1 policy | of giving unlimited |1 sanctuary | to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil ."

The |0 debate | |1 that | a |0 handful | of Texas multi-millionnaires close to the Bush family have cleverly manufactured over John Kerry 's war record is absurd in every way .
The |0 charges | |1 that | |0 they | have put some |1 vets | up to making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false .
"|0 Most | of those making the |1 charges | have even flip - flopped , contradicting |1 themselves | ."
Or |0 they | were n't eyewitnesses and are just lying .
But to address the |1 substance | of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic .
The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when |0 we | consider that |0 George | W. Bush never showed any |1 bravery | at all at any point in his life .
|0 He | has never lived in a war zone .
"If |0 some | of John Kerry 's wounds were superficial , |0 Bush | received no |1 wounds | ."
"( And , a |0 piece | of shrapnel in the forearm |0 that | caused only a minor |1 wound | would have killed had |0 it | hit an |1 eye | and gone into the brain ; the |0 shrapnel | being in your body demonstrates |0 you | were in mortal danger and did n't absent |1 yourself | from it ."
|0 That | is the logic of the medal ) .
|0 Kerry | saved a man 's |1 life | while under fire .
|0 Bush | did no such |1 thing | .
|1 What | was |0 Bush | doing with his youth ?
|0 He | was drinking .
"|0 He | was drinking like a fish , every night , into the wee hours ."
For decades .
"|0 He | gave no |1 service | to anyone , risked |1 nothing | , and did not even slack off efficiently ."
"The |0 history | of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because |0 it | not only speaks to Bush 's character as an addictive personality , but may tell |2 us | |1 something | about his erratic and alarming actions as president ."
"His explosive |0 temper | probably provoked the disastrous |1 siege | of Fallujah last spring , killing 600 |1 Iraqis | , |0 most | of them women and children , in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries , |0 one | of them a South African ."
"( |0 Newsweek | reported that |0 Bush | commanded his |1 cabinet | , "" Let |1 heads | roll ! "" )"
That |0 temper | is only one problem .
|0 Bush | has a sadistic |1 streak | .
"|0 He | clearly enjoyed , as governor , watching |1 executions | ."
"His |0 delight | in killing |1 people | became a campaign issue in 2000 when |0 he | seemed , in one debate , to enjoy the |1 prospect | of executing wrong - |1 doers | a little too much ."
|0 He | has clearly gone on enjoying killing |1 people | on a large scale in Iraq .
Drug |0 abuse | can affect the |1 ability | of the person to feel deep |1 emotions | like empathy .
Two |0 decades | of pickling his nervous |1 system | in various highly toxic substances have left |1 Bush | damaged goods .
"Even for those |0 who | later abstain , "" visual - spatial |0 abilities | , abstraction , problem solving , and short - term memory , are the slowest to recover . """
"That |0 he | managed to get on the wagon ( though with that pretzel incident , |0 you | wonder how firmly ) is laudable ."
"But |0 he | suffers the severe |1 effects | of the aftermath , and |0 we | are all suffering along with him now , since |0 he | is the most powerful man in the world ."
"|0 We | all know by now that |0 Bush | did not even do his full |1 service | with the Texas Air National Guard , absenting |1 himself | to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
Whether |0 he | was actually AWOL during this stint is unclear .
"But it is clear that not only did |0 Bush | slack off on his National Guard service , but |0 he | slacked off from his campaign work ."
"This little - noted |0 interview | with Blount 's nephew Murph Archibald , |0 which | appeared on National Public Radio 's "" All Things Considered on March 30 , 2004 , gives a devastating |1 insight | into what |0 it | was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period ."
""" All Things Considered ( 8:00 PM ET ) - NPR March 30 , 2004 Tuesday"
"This campaign season , there have been |0 questions | about whether |0 George | W. Bush fulfilled his |1 obligations | to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s ."
"For weeks , |0 reporters | scoured |1 Alabama | in search of pilots or anyone |0 who | might have remembered seeing |1 Mr. | Bush at the time |0 he | was serving in the National Guard there ."
"There is one |0 place | in Alabama where |0 Mr. | Bush was present nearly every day : the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton "" Red "" Blount ."
|0 President | Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason |0 he | transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard .
NPR 's |0 Wade | Goodwyn has this |1 report | about Mr. Bush 's time on that campaign .
WADE GOODWYN reporting :
"In 1972 , |0 Baba | Groom was a smart , funny young woman smack - dab in the middle of an exciting US Senate campaign ."
"|0 Groom | was Republican Red Blount 's scheduler , and in that job , |0 she | was the hub in the campaign wheel ."
"Ask |1 her | about the handsome young man from Texas , and |0 she | remembers |1 him | 32 years later like |0 it | was yesterday ."
Ms. BABA GROOM ( Former Campaign Worker ) :
|0 He | would wear khaki |1 trousers | and some old jacket .
|0 He | was always ready to go out on the road .
"On the phone , |0 you | could hear his |1 accent | ."
|0 It | was a Texas accent .
But |0 he | just melded with everybody .
"GOODWYN : The |0 candidate | |0 Mr. | Bush was working for , Red Blount , had gotten rich in Alabama in the construction business ."
Prominent Southern |0 Republicans | were something of a rare breed in those days .
Blount 's |0 support | of the party led |1 him | to be appointed Richard Nixon 's postmaster general .
"In Washington , |0 Blount | became friends and tennis partners with Mr. Bush 's father , then Congressman Bush ."
"|0 That | was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant |0 Bush | came to Montgomery , at his father 's urging . . ."
It was Mr. Bush 's job to organize the Republican county |1 chairpersons | in the 67 Alabama counties .
"Back in 1972 in the Deep South , many rural |0 counties | did n't have |1 much | in the way of official Republican Party apparatus ."
"But throughout Alabama , there were |0 Republicans | and Democrats |0 who | wanted to help |1 Red | Blount ."
It was the young Texan 's job to find out |1 what | each county |0 leader | needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those |1 supplies | to them .
"|0 Groom | says this |0 job | helped |1 Mr. | Bush understand how even in a statewide Senate campaign , |0 politics | are local ."
". . . |0 Murph | Archibald is Red Blount 's nephew by marriage , and in 1972 , |0 he | was coming off a 15 - month tour in Vietnam in the infantry ."
"|0 Archibald | says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers , |0 Mr. | Bush was not one of them ."
"Mr. MURPH ARCHIBALD ( Nephew of Red Blount ) : Well , |0 I | was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid-evenings ."
"Ordinarily , |0 George | would come in around noon ; |0 he | would ordinarily leave around 5:30 or 6:00 in the evening ."
"GOODWYN : |0 Archibald | says that two months before the election , in September of '72 , Red Blount 's campaign |0 manager | came to him and asked that |0 he | quietly take over Mr. Bush 's |1 job | because the campaign |0 materials | were not getting out to the counties ."
Mr. ARCHIBALD : |0 George | certainly did n't seem to have any |1 concerns | about |0 my | taking over this |1 work | with the campaign workers there .
My overall |0 impression | was that |0 he | did n't seem as interested in the campaign as the other people |0 who | were working at the state headquarters .
"GOODWYN : |0 Murph | Archibald says that at first , |0 he | did n't know that |0 Mr. | Bush was serving in the Air National Guard ."
"After |0 he | found out from somebody else , |0 Archibald | attempted to talk to Mr. Bush about it ."
"The |0 president | was a lieutenant and |0 Archibald | had been a lieutenant , too ; |0 he | figured |0 they | had |1 something | to talk about ."
Mr. ARCHIBALD : |0 George | did n't have any |1 interest | at all in talking about the military .
"In fact , when |0 I | broached the |1 subject | with him , |0 he | simply changed the |1 subject | ."
"|0 He | was n't unpleasant about it , but |0 he | just changed the |1 subject | and would n't talk about it ."
"GOODWYN : Far from Texas and Washington , DC , |0 Mr. | Bush enjoyed his |1 freedom | ."
|0 He | dated a beautiful young |1 woman | working on the campaign .
|0 He | went out in the evenings and had a good |1 time | .
"In fact , |0 he | left the |1 house | |0 he | rented in such disrepair -- with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- that the Montgomery |0 family | |0 who | owned |1 it | still grumble about the unpaid repair bill ."
"|0 Archibald | says |0 Mr. | Bush would come into the office and , in a friendly way , offer up |1 stories | about the drinking |0 he | 'd done the night before , kind of as a conversation starter ."
Mr. ARCHIBALD : |0 People | have different |1 ways | of starting the days in any office .
"|0 They | 're going to talk about their kids , |0 they | 're going to talk about football , |0 they | 're going to talk about the weather ."
And |0 this | was simply his opening gambit ; |0 he | would start talking about that |0 he | had been out late the night before drinking .
GOODWYN : |0 Archibald | says the |0 frequency | with which |0 Mr. | Bush discussed the |1 subject | was off - putting to him .
"Mr. ARCHIBALD : |0 I | mean , at that time , |0 I | was 28 ; |0 George | would have been 25 or 26 ."
"And |0 I | thought it was really unusual that |0 someone | in their mid-20s would initiate |1 conversations | , particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign , by talking about their drinking the night before ."
"|0 I | thought |1 it | unusual and , frankly , inappropriate ."
"GOODWYN : According to Archibald , |0 Mr. | Bush would also sometimes tell |1 stories | about his days at Yale in New Haven , and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving , he was let go after the |0 officers | discovered |0 he | was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator ."
"|0 Archibald | , a middle - class Alabama boy -- |0 who | , by the way , is now a registered Democrat -- did n't like that |1 story | ."
"Mr. ARCHIBALD : |0 He | told |1 us | whenever he was stopped , as soon as the law |0 enforcement | found out that |0 he | was the grandson of Prescott Bush , |0 they | would let |1 him | go ."
"And |0 he | would always laugh about that . """
|0 Goodwyn | dutifully notes that |0 Baba | Groom did n't remember |1 George | telling drunk |1 stories | .
"But |0 that | means |1 nothing | , since |0 they | were n't the sort of things |0 guys | like Bush told the "" |1 girls | "" ."
|0 He | was trying to buddy with Archibald and impress |1 him | .
"Again , |0 decades | of this sort of behavior do not leave a |1 person | untouched ."
Our |0 world | is in crisis and our |0 Republic | is in danger .
It should not be left in the hands of a man |0 who | spent his |1 life | like this .

"Afraid |0 I | do n't have |1 time | today to discuss |1 these | , but some |0 stories | need |1 attention | :"
"From Wednesday 's Mirror the headline , "" Have 200,000 |0 AK47s | Fallen Into the Hands of Iraq Terrorists ? """
( also see this |1 thread | on the RI discussion board ) :
"Some 200,000 guns the |0 US | sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists , it was feared yesterday ."
The 99 - tonne |0 cache | of AK47s was to have been secretly flown out from a US base in Bosnia .
But the four |0 planeloads | of arms have vanished .
Orders for the |0 deal | to go ahead were given by the US Department of Defense .
But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private arms traders .
"And the Moldovan airline used to transport the |1 shipment | was blasted by the UN in 2003 for smuggling |1 arms | to Liberia , human rights group |0 Amnesty | has discovered ."
|0 It | follows a separate |1 probe | claiming that |0 thousands | of guns meant for Iraq 's police and army instead went to al - Qaeda .
"Amnesty chief spokesman |0 Mike | Blakemore said : "" |0 It | 's unbelievable that no |0 one | can account for 200,000 assault rifles ."
"If these |0 weapons | have gone missing |0 it | 's a terrifying prospect . """
"American defence |0 chiefs | hired a US |1 firm | to take the |1 guns | , from the 90s Bosnian war , to Iraq ."
"But air traffic |0 controllers | in Baghdad have no |1 record | of the flights , |0 which | supposedly took off between July 2004 and July 2005 ."
"A coalition forces |0 spokesman | confirmed |0 they | had not received "" any |1 weapons | from Bosnia "" and added |0 they | were "" not aware of any purchases for Iraq from Bosnia "" ."
"Nato and US |0 officials | have already voiced |1 fears | that Bosnian arms - sold by US , British and Swiss firms - are being passed to insurgents ."
"A NATO |0 spokesman | said : "" There 's no tracking |0 mechanism | to ensure |0 they | do n't fall into the wrong hands ."
"There are |0 concerns | that some may have been siphoned off . """
This year a |0 newspaper | claimed two UK |0 firms | were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi forces were re-routed to al - Qaeda .
"The Moldovan |0 airline | is Aerocom , and yes , |0 it | 's one of Victor Bout 's ."
"|0 It | 's always a bang - your - |1 head | - against - the - wall moment , reading again the |1 play | the incompetence |0 theory | receives , even from some of the Administration 's harshest mainstream critics ."
"But then , even to talk of an "" administration "" may be misdirection at this point , given how little representative |0 government | means in the United States these days , and how much of "" national security "" has been privatized into a global gangland of drugs and guns ."
"Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been "" lost "" in Iraq , |0 planeloads | of arms do n't just "" vanish "" ; not when the |0 Pentagon | contracts the |1 work | to an international criminal of Bout 's untouchable stature ."
"But Bout 's |0 name | is n't likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this |0 story | receives , before |0 it | sinks like so many others beneath the media 's frothing triviality ."
"Meanwhile , a decision 's been reached in the trial of Toledo priest Gerald Robinson ."
And |0 it | 's guilty :
"The |0 Rev. | Gerald Robinson appeared stony - faced as the jury 's guilty verdict was read , and |0 he | blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs ."

The |0 crime | occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital |1 chapel | in downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980 .
"|0 Investigators | said the nun , Margaret Ann Pahl , 71 , was strangled and then stabbed , with nine |0 wounds | on her chest forming the |1 shape | of an inverted cross , a well - recognized Satanic symbol ."
"An altar cloth was draped over her half - naked body , which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted ."
""" |0 It | was about how |0 he | could humiliate |1 her | the most , "" prosecutor |0 Dean | Mandros said in closing arguments ."

From SNAP 's statement on the Robinson conviction :
"More than ever , |0 police | and prosecutors have the |1 tools | and the will to go after horrific crimes , even when the |0 defendants | are seemingly powerful individuals or institutions ."
"When |0 victims | and witnesses stay silent , |0 nothing | changes ."
"When |0 victims | and witnesses speak up , at least sometimes a child is protected , the truth is exposed , and justice is done ."

CRACKDOWN ON POLYGAMY GROUP
Small polygamous |0 groups | have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a |0 sect | known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separated |1 itself | from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 .
...
"Now , FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI 's list of "" Ten Most Wanted Fugitives , "" a move |0 that | caps law enforcement 's dramatic |1 change | of approach toward the polygamous group in recent years ... [ because of ] the impact |1 that | the group 's |0 practices | , law enforcement |0 officials | say , are having on the most vulnerable within the sect , particularly children and women ."
"When the |0 FLDS | under Mr. Jeffs ( and his father before him ) grew to some 10,000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $ 110 million ; when |0 it | became clear that government |0 officials | , school authorities , and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect ; when |0 ex-members | increasingly reported child and sexual abuse |1 charges | ( mainly involving underage |1 girls | forced to marry older |1 men | ) ; and when the |0 sect | began to use secluded |1 compounds | , state and federal |0 authorities | started to crack down more vigorously ."
...
"Specifically , Jeffs is charged in Utah and Arizona with sexual assault of underage girls and with arranging "" spiritual "" |1 marriages | for girls and older men ."
"At weekend press conferences in Salt Lake City and Phoenix , FBI and state |0 officials | said Jeffs "" is considered armed and dangerous and may be traveling with armed bodyguards . """
"In the past , |0 he | has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world , according to former members ."
...
"As with Christian Identity and other hate - related philosophies tied to the Aryan Nations and the neo-Nazi Creativity Movement , |0 Jeffs | has preached |1 racism | as well ."

"An |0 editorial | in the church - owned Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake City earlier this year acknowledged that "" the state 's |0 history | , a conservative belief in free choice , and an unwillingness to stir up a hornet 's |1 nest | in the national media have likely all contributed to the kid - glove approach |0 lawmakers | and law - enforcement officers have taken when dealing with polygamous communities .

"When |0 Iraq | invaded |1 Kuwait | , many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- Germany , France , Canada , Denmark , England , the United States -- where they were raised by guardians |0 who | were usually Mujahedeen supporters ."
"When |0 they | were 18 or 19 , |0 many | of them decided to come back to Iraq and fill the |1 ranks | of the youngest Mujahedeen generation ."
"Though '' |0 decided | '' is probably not the right word , since from the day they were born , these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their |1 leaders | ."
"'' Every morning and night , the |0 kids | , beginning as young as 1 and 2 , had to stand before a poster of Massoud and Maryam , salute |1 them | and shout |1 praises | to them , '' |0 Nadereh | Afshari , a former Mujahedeen deep - believer , told |1 me | ."
"|0 Afshari | , who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving Mujahedeen |1 children | during the gulf war , said that when the German |0 government | tried to absorb Mujahedeen |1 children | into their education system , the |0 Mujahedeen | refused ."
"Many of the children were sent to Mujahedeen schools , particularly in France ."
"The |0 Rajavis | , |0 Afshari | went on to say , '' saw these |1 kids | as the next generation 's soldiers ."
|0 They | wanted to brainwash |1 them | and control |1 them | . ''
|0 Which | may explain the |1 pattern | to their stories : a journey to self - empowerment and the enlightenment of self - sacrifice inspired by the light and wisdom of Maryam and Massoud .

One man 's relentless |0 search | for his missing son led |1 him | to uncover |1 one | of the most shocking crimes in post-war Italy - a tale of satanism and violence |0 that | has gripped the |1 country | for more than a year .
"In January 1998 |0 Fabio | Tollis and Chiara Marino , both just 16 , disappeared ."
|0 They | had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and |0 they | never came home .
The |0 police | and many of their friends just thought |0 they | had run off together .
But their |0 parents | refused to accept |1 this | .
"|0 Michele | Tollis , Fabio 's father , began to attend metal |1 concerts | and festivals across Europe , handing out |1 leaflets | and quizzing Fabio 's |1 friends | ."
"|0 Fabio | and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the |0 role | of this music is central to the story ."
No |0 one | can contradict |1 me | when |0 I | say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked
Michele Tollis
"|0 It | emerged that |0 Chiara | , the girl |0 who | disappeared with Fabio , had a |1 collection | of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom ."
"During this search , |0 Michele | Tollis became convinced that |0 satanism | had |1 something | to do with his son 's disappearance ."

|0 They | are merely imposters .
"|0 Everything | |0 they | claim is a lie , and this above all ."
So why even credit their |1 claims | ?
|0 This | only serves their |1 purposes | .
"|0 They | want to be identified as ' Christians ' , and |0 I | fully suspect that for some of them , the |0 motivation | behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage , and has a lot |1 more | to do with the black magician 's practice of the inversion principle ."

Almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th Century ( except for Italian Futurism ) were labeled ' degenerate ' by the National Socialists .
"|0 Adolf | Hitler even held an |1 exhibition | of ' degenerate art ' in 1937 , while curating a parallel |1 show | of ' Aryan ' art across the street ."
The German Expressionist movement was destroyed as a result .
Here 's a quick |0 overview | of the Entartete Kunst ( Degenerate Art ) exhibit of 1937 :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art
"Ironically ( or perhaps not ) , the notion of the ' degenerate ' and ' degenerate art ' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish ' intellectual ' Max Nordau and a 1892 book |0 he | authored called Degeneration . ."
|0 Nordau | was also the co founder of the World Zionist Organization .

Tronicus :
"Simply , the |0 questions | permeate the entire ' Western ( Mystery ) |1 Tradition | ' and perhaps ' Eastern ' as well , as |0 they | relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality ."
"For example , is the |0 system | of Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process ?"
Or was |0 it | supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation ?
"Similarly , is |0 invoking | ancient Egyptian |1 gods | and goddesses a reaffirmation of an oppressive and hierarchical system ?"
"In my opinion , |0 people | can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political |1 systems | ."
The ' high |0 weirdness | ' and more hardcore political ' factions ' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis .
"In regards to death metal , the |0 problem | is , once again , a question of education , history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture ."
Shall |0 we | censor the |1 works | of poet Charles Baudelaire as well ?
|0 Baudelaire | was perhaps one of the first ' death metal ' artists .
"Tronicus , if |0 you | 're still checking this |1 thread | :"
"A bit of a knee - jerk reaction from me there , and |0 I | apologize for my over-generalizations ."
"My real |0 problem | is with literalist fundamentalists , of any religion ."
True |0 believers | are dangerous animals .
"|0 I | just get hung up on ' Christians ' , as |0 they | 're the dominant form where |0 I | come from ."
"Also , |0 I | 'm quite clear on the fact that |0 those | in power now ( and , in general , most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure ) tend to use the dominant |1 religion | as a cloak to hide their true |1 motivations | and as a tool to control the |1 masses | ."
"|0 It | boggles the |1 mind | that |0 ANYONE | can take at face value Bush 's |1 claims | to be a christian , yet |0 many | seem to do just |1 that | ."
"|0 I | seem to remember |1 something | about ' by their works shall |0 ye | know |1 them | . """
|0 I | do get my |1 hackles | up a bit when |0 people | haul out the old ' |0 Rock | - N - Roll made |0 them | do |1 it | ' |1 argument | .
"Whie |0 I | do n't subscribe to the notion that the |0 things | |0 we | watch or listen to have no |1 effect | on our behavior ( |0 which | |0 I | think is patently rediculous ) , it does bother |1 me | when |0 people | single out a specific |1 group | of people to pin the |1 blame | on ."
|0 Sub-cultures | ( as the |0 lable | implies ) do not develope in a vacuum .
"Again , |0 I | think the |0 problem | is people |0 who | sink to far into their own egos , and begin to take their personal |1 metaphors | a bit too literaly ."
These |0 people | are dangerous wether |0 they | 're head - banging to ' Canibal Corpse ' or humming along to ' Onward Christian Soldiers ' .
( The |0 mixing | of religion and militarism is a whole other topic .... )
"|0 I | have |1 nothing | but respect for people |0 who | adhear to non-violence , forgiveness , and charity , but it 's important to remember that |0 Christians | ( or ' Smartwolves ' ) do not have a |1 monopoly | on that particular lifestyle ."
Peace .
"The |0 fact | that the US |0 government | and media are having a hissy |1 fit | over |0 Venezuela | wanting to buy |1 guns | , and then |0 200,000 | of the guns |0 Chavez | wants to buy go missing on their way to Iraq is definitely sus ."
|0 I | guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US 's local stooges and |0 they | then have a |1 pretext | to ramp the |1 spin | up a notch or two .
Thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for passing |1 this | along via e-mail .
|0 It | is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation .
|0 It | 's a long but very worthwhile read .
""" A View from the Eye of the Storm """
"Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation , April , 2004 :"
""" As |0 you | know , |0 I | usually provide the scientific and technological "" |1 entertainment | "" in our meetings , but , on this occasion , our |0 Chairman | suggested that |0 I | present my own personal |1 view | on events in the part of the world from which |0 I | come ."
|0 I | have never been and |0 I | will never be a Government official and |0 I | have no privileged |1 information | .
"My perspective is entirely based on |1 what | |0 I | see , on |1 what | |0 I | read and on the fact that my |0 family | has lived in this region for almost 200 years ."
"|0 You | may regard my |1 views | as those of the proverbial taxi driver , |1 which | |0 you | are supposed to question , when |0 you | visit a |1 country | ."
|0 I | could have shared with you some fascinating |1 facts | and some personal thoughts about the Israeli - Arab conflict .
"However , |0 I | will touch upon it only in passing ."
|0 I | prefer to devote |1 most | of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
"|0 I | refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , |0 which | is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non-Arab and also significant non-Moslem |1 minorities | ."
Why do |0 I | put aside |1 Israel | and its own immediate neighborhood ?
"Because |0 Israel | and any problems related to it , in spite of |1 what | |0 you | might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region ."
"Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab |0 conflict | , but |0 it | is not where the main |0 show | is ."
The |0 millions | |0 who | died in the Iran - Iraq war had |1 nothing | to do with Israel .
"The mass |0 murder | happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem |0 regime | is massacring its black Christian |1 citizens | , has |1 nothing | to do with Israel ."
The frequent |0 reports | from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have |1 nothing | to do with Israel .
"|0 Saddam | Hussein did not invade |1 Kuwait | , endanger Saudi |1 Arabia | and butcher his own |1 people | because of Israel ."
|0 Egypt | did not use poison |1 gas | against Yemen in the 60's because of Israel .
|0 Assad | the Father did not kill |1 tens | of |1 thousands | of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
The Taliban |0 control | of Afghanistan and the civil war there had |1 nothing | to do with Israel .
"The Libyan blowing |0 up | of the Pan - Am flight had |1 nothing | to do with Israel , and |0 I | could go on and on and on ."
"The |0 root | of the trouble is that this entire Moslem |0 region | is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if |0 Israel | had joined the Arab |1 league | and an independent |0 Palestine | had existed for 100 years ."
"The 22 member |0 countries | of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total |1 population | of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion ."
|0 They | have a land |1 area | larger than either the US or all of Europe .
"These 22 |0 countries | , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined |1 GDP | smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone ."
"Within this meager GDP , the |0 gaps | between rich and poor are beyond belief and too |0 many | of the rich made their |1 money | not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers ."
The social |0 status | of women is far below what |0 it | was in the Western World 150 years ago .
"Human |0 rights | are below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission ."
"According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U.N. , the |0 number | of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little |0 Greece | alone translates ."
The total |0 number | of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
"Birth |0 rates | in the region are very high , increasing the |1 poverty | , the social gaps and the cultural decline ."
"And |0 all | of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , |0 which | developed , at some point in history , |1 one | of the most advanced cultures in the world ."
"It is fair to say that |0 this | creates an unprecedented breeding |1 ground | for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline ."
"It is also a fact that almost |0 everybody | in the region blames this |1 situation | on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves ."
"A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people |0 who | are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families : |0 They | are double victims of an outside world , |0 which | now develops |1 Islamophobia | , and of their own environment |0 which | breaks their |1 heart | by being totally dysfunctional ."
"The |0 problem | is that the vast silent |0 majority | of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but |0 they | also do not stand up against it ."
"|0 They | become accomplices , by omission , and |0 this | applies to political leaders , intellectuals , business people and many others ."
"|0 Many | of them can certainly tell |1 right | from wrong , but are afraid to express their |1 views | ."
"The |0 events | of the last few years have amplified four |1 issues | , |0 which | have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region ."
"A few more |0 years | may pass before |0 everybody | acknowledges that |0 it | is a World War , but |0 we | are already well into it ."
"|0 These | are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps |0 we | should already refer to it as "" the undeclared World War III "" :"
* 1 . The first |0 element | is the suicide murder . *
"Suicide |0 murders | are not a new invention but they have been made popular , if |0 I | may use this |1 expression | , only lately ."
"Even after September 11 , it seems that |0 most | of the Western World does not yet understand this |1 weapon | ."
|0 It | is a very potent psychological weapon .
Its real direct |0 impact | is relatively minor .
The total |0 number | of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
|0 September | 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
More |0 people | die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians |0 who | died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that |0 conflict | started .
|0 Saddam | killed every month more |1 people | than all those |0 who | died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .
So |0 what | is all the fuss about suicide killings ?
|0 It | creates |1 headlines | .
|0 It | is spectacular .
|0 It | is frightening .
|0 It | is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
It is always shown on television in great detail .
"One such |0 murder | , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism |1 industry | of a country for quite a while , as |0 it | did in Bali and in Turkey ."
But the real |0 fear | comes from the undisputed fact that no |0 defense | and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
|0 This | has not yet penetrated the |1 thinking | of the Western World .
"The |0 U.S. | and Europe are constantly improving their |1 defense | against the last murder , not the next one ."
|0 We | may arrange for the best airport security in the world .
"But if |0 you | want to murder by suicide , |0 you | do not have to board a |1 plane | in order to explode |1 yourself | and kill many |1 people | ."
|0 Who | could stop a suicide |1 murder | in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?
How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?
Put a metal |1 detector | in front of every train station in Spain and the |0 terrorists | will get the |1 buses | .
"Protect the |1 buses | and |0 they | will explode in movie theaters , concert halls , supermarkets , shopping malls , schools and hospitals ."
"Put |1 guards | in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this |0 line | will be the target , not to speak of killing the |1 guards | themselves ."
|0 You | can somewhat reduce your |1 vulnerability | by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate |1 it | and definitely not win the |1 war | in a defensive way .
And |0 it | is a war !
|0 What | is behind the suicide murders ?
"|0 Money | is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else ."
|0 It | has |1 nothing | to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
No Moslem |0 preacher | has ever blown |1 himself | up .
No |0 son | of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown |1 himself | up .
No |0 relative | of anyone influential has done |1 it | .
"Would n't |0 you | expect |1 some | of the religious leaders to do |1 it | themselves , or to talk their |1 sons | into doing |1 it | , if |0 this | is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?"
Are n't |0 they | interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
"Instead , |0 they | send outcast |1 women | , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads ."
"|0 They | promise |2 them | the |1 delights | , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their |1 families | handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent |0 people | are dead ."
Suicide |0 murders | also have |1 nothing | to do with poverty and despair .
"The poorest |0 region | in the world , by far , is Africa ."
|0 It | never happens there .
"There are numerous desperate |0 people | in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents ."
"|0 Desperation | does not provide |1 anyone | with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation ."
"There was certainly more |0 despair | in Saddam 's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer 's Iraq , and no |0 one | exploded |1 himself | ."
"A suicide |0 murder | is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power ."
"The only |0 way | to fight this new "" popular "" |1 weapon | is identical to the only way in which |0 you | fight organized |1 crime | or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way ."
"Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the |0 forces | on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the |1 top | of the crime pyramid ."
|0 You | can not eliminate organized |1 crime | by arresting the little drug |1 dealer | on the street corner .
"|0 You | must go after the head of the "" Family "" ."
"If |0 part | of the public supports |1 it | , |0 others | tolerate |1 it | , |0 many | are afraid of it and |0 some | try to explain |1 it | away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized |0 crime | will thrive and so will |0 terrorism | ."
"The United |0 States | understands |1 this | now , after September 11 ."
|0 Russia | is beginning to understand |1 it | .
|0 Turkey | understands |1 it | well .
|0 I | am very much afraid that |0 most | of Europe still does not understand |1 it | .
"Unfortunately , it seems that |0 Europe | will understand |1 it | only after suicide |0 murders | arrive in Europe in a big way ."
"In my humble opinion , |0 this | will definitely happen ."
The Spanish |0 trains | and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .
The |0 unity | of the Civilized World in fighting this |1 horror | is absolutely indispensable .
"Until |0 Europe | wakes up , this unity will not be achieved ."
"* 2 . The second |0 ingredient | is words , more precisely lies . *"
|0 Words | can be lethal .
|0 They | kill |1 people | .
"It is often said that |0 politicians | , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life ."
"But the |0 norms | of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , |0 which | have reached new |1 heights | in the region |0 we | are talking about ."
"An incredible |0 number | of people in the Arab world believe that |0 September | 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot ."
"|0 You | all remember the Iraqi |1 Minister | of Information , Mr. Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and his press conferences when the US |0 forces | were already inside Baghdad ."
|0 Disinformation | at time of war is an accepted tactic .
"But to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous |1 statements | , known to everybody to be lies , without even being ridiculed in your own milieu , can only happen in this region ."
"|0 Mr. | Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester , but |0 this | did not stop some allegedly respectable |1 newspapers | from giving |2 him | equal |1 time | ."
"|0 It | also does not prevent the Western |1 press | from giving |1 credence | , every day , even now , to similar liars ."
"After all , if |0 you | want to be an anti-Semite , there are subtle |0 ways | of doing |1 it | ."
"|0 You | do not have to claim that the |0 holocaust | never happened , and that the Jewish |0 temple | in Jerusalem never existed ."
But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that |0 this | is the case .
"When these same |0 leaders | make other |1 statements | , the Western |0 media | report |1 them | as if |0 they | could be true ."
"It is a daily occurrence that the same |0 people | |0 who | finance , arm and dispatch suicide |1 murderers | , condemn the |1 act | in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , |0 which | even partly believes |1 them | ."
It is a daily routine to hear the same |0 leader | making opposite |1 statements | in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
"|0 Incitement | by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those |0 who | lie , distort and want to destroy |1 everything | ."
"Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs , and the Western |0 World | does not notice |1 it | because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows ."
"|0 I | recommend to you , even though |0 most | of you do not understand |1 Arabic | , to watch Al |1 Jazeera | , from time to time ."
|0 You | will not believe your own |1 eyes | .
"But |0 words | also work in other ways , more subtle ."
"A demonstration in Berlin , carrying |1 banners | supporting Saddam 's |1 regime | and featuring three - year old |1 babies | dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "" peace demonstration "" ."
"|0 You | may support or oppose the Iraq |1 war | , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much ."
"A |0 woman | walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day , eats , observes |1 families | with old people and children eating their |1 lunch | in the adjacent tables and pays the |1 bill | ."
"|0 She | then blows |1 herself | up , killing 20 |1 people | , including many children , with |0 heads | and arms rolling around in the restaurant ."
"She is called "" martyr "" by several Arab leaders and called "" activist "" by the European press ."
|0 Dignitaries | condemn the |1 act | but visit her bereaved |1 family | and the |0 money | flows .
"There is a new |0 game | in town : The actual murderer is called "" the military wing "" , the one |0 who | pays |1 him | , equips |1 him | and sends |1 him | is now called "" the political wing "" and the head of the operation is called the "" spiritual leader "" ."
"There are numerous other |0 examples | of such Orwellian nomenclature , used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media ."
These |0 words | are much more dangerous than many |0 people | realize .
|0 They | provide an emotional |1 infrastructure | for atrocities .
"It was Joseph Goebbels |0 who | said that if |0 you | repeat a |1 lie | often enough , |0 people | will believe |1 it | ."
He is now being outperformed by his successors .
* 3 . The third |0 aspect | is money . *
"Huge amounts of money , |0 which | could have solved many social |1 problems | in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting |1 death | and murder ."
In the inner circle are the |0 terrorists | themselves .
"The |0 money | funds their |1 travel | , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets ."
"The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes ."
"These |0 states | , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors ."
"They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , |0 all | of whom make a |1 living | , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure ."
"Finally , |0 we | find the third |1 circle | of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , |0 which | actually do some |1 good | , feed the |1 hungry | and provide some |1 schooling | , but brainwash a new |1 generation | with hatred , lies and ignorance ."
"This |0 circle | operates mostly through mosques , madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed |1 media | ."
"It is this |0 circle | |0 that | makes sure that |0 women | remain inferior , that |0 democracy | is unthinkable and that |0 exposure | to the outside world is minimal ."
"It is also that circle |0 that | leads the |1 way | in blaming |1 everybody | outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region ."
"The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations , whose |0 goals | may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle ."
"The Saudi |0 regime | , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner |0 circle | will explode into the outer circle ."
"The |0 Saudis | are beginning to understand |1 it | , but |0 they | fight the inner |1 circles | , while still financing the |1 infrastructure | at the outer circle ."
"Figuratively speaking , this outer |0 circle | is the guardian , |0 which | makes sure that the |0 people | look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside ."
"Some |0 parts | of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles ."
The horrifying added |0 factor | is the high birth rate .
"|0 Half | of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more |1 generations | of blind hatred ."
|0 Some | of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
"|0 You | meet their |1 children | in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers ."
"The Jihad "" |0 soldiers | "" join packaged death |1 tours | to Iraq and other hotspots , while |0 some | of their leaders ski in Switzerland ."
"|0 Mrs. | Arafat , |0 who | lives in Paris with her daughter , receives |1 tens | of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local |0 ringleader | of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash |1 payment | of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing |1 murders | at the retail level ."
* 4 . The fourth |0 element | of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws . *
"The civilized |0 world | believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties ."
"There are naive old - fashioned |0 habits | such as respecting religious |1 sites | and symbols , not using |1 ambulances | and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the |1 mutilation | of dead bodies and not using |1 children | as human shields or human bombs ."
"Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total |0 disregard | of all of the above as |0 we | observe now ."
Every |0 student | of political science debates how |0 you | prevent an anti-democratic |1 force | from winning a democratic |1 election | and abolishing |1 democracy | .
Other |0 aspects | of a civilized society must also have |1 limitations | .
Can a |0 policeman | open |1 fire | on someone trying to kill |1 him | ?
Can a |0 government | listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers ?
"Does free |0 speech | protect |1 you | when |0 you | shout "" |1 fire | "" in a crowded theater ?"
"Should there be death |0 penalty | , for deliberate multiple murders ?"
|0 These | are the old - fashioned dilemmas .
But now |0 we | have an entire new |1 set | .
"Do |0 you | raid a |1 mosque | , |0 which | serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?"
"Do |0 you | return |1 fire | , if you are attacked from a hospital ?"
Do |0 you | storm a |1 church | taken over by terrorists |0 who | took the |1 priests | hostages ?
Do |0 you | search every |1 ambulance | after a few suicide |0 murderers | use |1 ambulances | to reach their |1 targets | ?
Do |0 you | strip every |1 woman | because |0 one | pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide |1 bomb | on her belly ?
"Do |0 you | shoot back at someone trying to kill |1 you | , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?"
"Do |0 you | raid terrorist |1 headquarters | , hidden in a mental hospital ?"
"Do |0 you | shoot an |1 arch-murderer | |0 who | deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?"
|0 All | of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .
|1 What | do |0 you | do ?
"Well , |0 you | do not want to face the |1 dilemma | ."
But it can not be avoided .
"Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that |0 someone | would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one |1 atrocity | after another in Spain or in France , killing |1 hundreds | of innocent people , accepting |1 responsibility | for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do |1 more | of the same , while the |0 Government | of Iran issues public |1 condemnations | of his acts but continues to host |1 him | , invite |1 him | to official functions and treat |1 him | as a great dignitary ."
"|0 I | leave it to you as homework to figure out |1 what | |0 Spain | or France would have done , in such a situation ."
The |0 problem | is that the civilized |0 world | is still having |1 illusions | about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
|0 It | is trying to play ice |1 hockey | by sending a ballerina ice - |1 skater | into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight |1 boxer | by a chess player .
"In the same way that no |0 country | has a |1 law | against |0 cannibals | eating its prime |1 minister | , because such an |0 act | is unthinkable , international |0 law | does not address |0 killers | shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society ."
"International |0 law | does not know how to handle |1 someone | |0 who | sends |1 children | to throw |1 stones | , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and can not be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government ."
"International |0 law | does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , |0 which | pretends to condemn his |1 acts | or just claims to be too weak to arrest |1 him | ."
"The amazing |0 thing | is that |0 all | of these crooks demand |1 protection | under international law , and define all |1 those | |0 who | attack |1 them | as "" war criminals , "" with some Western |0 media | repeating the |1 allegations | ."
"The good |0 news | is that |0 all | of this is temporary , because the |0 evolution | of international law has always adapted |1 itself | to reality ."
"The |0 punishment | for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after ."
"After every world war , the |0 rules | of international law have changed , and the |0 same | will happen after the present one ."
"But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done ."
The |0 picture | |0 I | described here is not pretty .
|1 What | can |0 we | do about it ?
"In the short run , only fight and win ."
"In the long run , only educate the next |1 generation | and open |1 it | to the world ."
The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .
The outer circle can not be eliminated by force .
"Here |0 we | need financial |1 starvation | of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter-propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene ."
"Above all , |0 we | need a total absolute |1 unity | and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil ."
"Allow |1 me | , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science ."
"When |0 you | have a malignant |1 tumor | , |0 you | may remove the |1 tumor | itself surgically ."
"|0 You | may also starve |1 it | by preventing new |1 blood | from reaching |1 it | from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new "" |1 supplies | "" from expanding the |1 tumor | ."
"If |0 you | want to be sure , it is best to do |1 both | ."
"But before |0 you | fight and win , by force or otherwise , |0 you | have to realize that |0 you | are in a war , and |0 this | may take |1 Europe | a few more years ."
"In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist |1 regimes | , so that no |0 Government | in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people ."
"|0 I | do not want to comment here on whether the American - led |0 attack | on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument , but |0 I | can look at the post-war map of Western Asia ."
"Now that |0 Afghanistan | , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist |0 states | remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony ."
Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list .
"As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them ."
"Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union ."
"Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel ."
|0 This | is a significant strategic change and |0 it | applies strong |1 pressure | on the terrorist countries .
It is not surprising that |0 Iran | is so active in trying to incite a Shiite |1 uprising | in Iraq .
"|0 I | do not know if the American |0 plan | was actually to encircle both |1 Iran | and Syria , but |0 that | is the resulting situation ."
"In my humble opinion , the number one |0 danger | to the world today is Iran and its regime ."
|0 It | definitely has |1 ambitions | to rule vast |1 areas | and to expand in all directions .
|0 It | has an |1 ideology | |0 which | claims |1 supremacy | over Western culture .
|0 It | is ruthless .
"|0 It | has proven that |0 it | can execute elaborate terrorist |1 acts | without leaving too many |1 traces | , using Iranian |1 Embassies | ."
|0 It | is clearly trying to develop nuclear |1 weapons | .
"Its so - called |0 moderates | and conservatives play their own virtuoso |1 version | of the "" good - cop versus bad - cop "" game ."
"|0 Iran | sponsors Syrian |1 terrorism | , |0 it | is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , |0 it | is fully funding the |1 Hezbollah | and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; |0 it | performed |1 acts | of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and |0 it | truly leads a multi-national terror |1 consortium | , |0 which | includes , as minor players , |1 Syria | , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq ."
"Nevertheless , most European |0 countries | still trade with Iran , try to appease |1 it | and refuse to read the clear |1 signals | ."
In order to win the |1 war | it is also necessary to dry the financial |1 resources | of the terror conglomerate .
"It is pointless to try to understand the subtle |1 differences | between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises ."
"When it serves their business |1 needs | , |0 all | of them collaborate beautifully ."
"It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial |1 support | of the outer circle , |0 which | is the fertile breeding ground of terror ."
"It is important to monitor all |1 donations | from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the |1 finances | of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism ."
"It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western |1 media | |0 who | collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance ."
"Above all , never surrender to terror ."
"No |0 one | will ever know whether the recent |0 elections | in Spain would have yielded a different |1 result | , if not for the train bombings a few days earlier ."
But it really does not matter .
|0 What | matters is that the |0 terrorists | believe that |0 they | caused the |1 result | and that |0 they | won by driving |1 Spain | out of Iraq .
"The Spanish |0 story | will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , |0 who | is now expelling inciting |1 preachers | and forbidding |1 veils | and including others |0 who | sent |1 troops | to Iraq ."
"In the long run , |0 Spain | itself will pay even |1 more | ."
Is the |0 solution | a democratic Arab world ?
"If by democracy |0 we | mean free |1 elections | but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , |0 democracy | is the solution ."
"If |0 democracy | is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the |1 one | whose |0 incitement | and fabrications are the most inflammatory ."
"|0 We | have seen |1 it | already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey ."
"|0 It | will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully ."
"On the other hand , a certain transition |0 democracy | , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the |1 way | for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden |0 democracy | did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China ."
|0 I | have no |1 doubt | that the civilized |0 world | will prevail .
"But the |1 longer | it takes |1 us | to understand the new |1 landscape | of this war , the more costly and painful the |0 victory | will be ."
"|0 Europe | , more than any other region , is the key ."
"Its understandable |0 recoil | from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost |1 thousands | of additional innocent lives , before the |0 tide | will turn . """
Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest .
|0 Zawahiri | and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed 's |1 taking | of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders .
"By 1998 , |0 Zawahiri | had determined that the Egyptian Islamic |0 Jihad | should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime ."

"In early June 2003 , a Central Intelligence Agency ( "" CIA "" ) |0 report | publicly disclosed that the |0 reason | for Mohammed Atta 's and Zacarias Moussaoui 's inquiries into cropdusters was for the contemplated use in dispersing biological |1 agents | such as anthrax ."

"According to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet , al Qaeda ’s |0 ability | to conduct an anthrax |1 attack | is one of the most immediate threats the United |0 States | is likely to face . """
"On August 9 , 2004 , it was announced that in the Spring of 2001 , a |0 man | named |1 El | - Shukrijumah , also known as Jafar the Pilot , |0 who | was part of a "" second wave , "" had been casing New York City |1 helicopters | ."
|0 Photographs | from a seized computer disc included the |1 controls | and the locks on the door between the passengers and pilot .
"In a bulletin , the |0 FBI | noted that the |0 surveillance | might relate to a plot to disperse a chemical or biological |1 weapon | ."
The |0 CIA | reportedly has been quietly building a |1 case | that the anthrax |0 mailings | were an international plot .
|0 This | is old news .
"|0 It | 's just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the FBI 's ( former ) |1 theory | about a lone , American scientist ."
"Many |0 people | have argued that a US - based Al Qaeda |0 operative | is behind the earlier Fall 2001 anthrax mailings in the US , and that the |0 mailings | served as a threat and warning ."
"Princeton islamist scholar |0 Bernard | Lewis has explained that while |0 islamists | may disagree about whether killing |1 innocents | is sanctioned by the laws of jihad , |0 extremists | like Zawahiri agree that notice must be given before biochemical weapons are used ."

"|0 Mabruk | , at the time , was the head of Jihad 's military operations ."

"In October 2001 , did the FBI |0 profilers | know of the draft message |0 Khalid | Mohammed had on the seized laptop ( from 1995 ) that was signed "" Khalid Sheik Bojinka "" ?"
The |0 letter | threatened to use biochemical |1 weapons | if the blind sheik was not released .
"( Khalid Mohammed 's |0 involvement | dates back to Bojinka , as does |0 Hambali | 's ) ."
|0 Use | of biochemical weapons as blackmail and threatened retaliation for such detentions was an alternative scenario in the Bojinka planning .
"In May 2004 , |0 Patrick | Hughes , Lieutenant General ( Retired ) , Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis , Homeland Security Department testified before the 9/11 Commission ."
"|0 He | explained that |0 interrogations | and other evidence revealed that Al |0 Qaeda | wanted to strike the |1 US | with a nonconventional weapon , most notably anthrax ."
"The same week , the WTC |0 head | testified that while |0 they | had not received any |1 briefing | on the use of planes , |0 they | had taken |1 steps | to prepare for an attack using |1 anthrax | based on intelligence that had been received ."
"Al |0 Qaeda | has had |1 anthrax | , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( "" Moro Front "" or "" MILF "" ) ."
"|0 Zawahiri | , Al Qaeda 's # 2 , is head of Al Qaeda 's biochemical program ."
The |0 CIA | has known of Zawahiri 's plans to use |1 anthrax | for a half decade .
The |0 confidante | and right - hand man of Dr. Ayman Zawahiri admitted that |0 Zawahiri | succeeded in obtaining |1 anthrax | and intended to use |1 it | against US targets .
Another senior Al Qaeda |0 member | ( a shura or policy - making council member no less ) was working for the Egyptian intelligence services and |0 he | confirmed the |1 report | in a sworn lengthy confession .
Even Zawahiri 's |0 attorney | in 1999 said that |0 Bin | Laden and Zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents |0 they | possessed given the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda |0 leaders | faced .
A recently released |0 islamist | |0 who | had been a close associate of Zawahiri said that |0 Zawahiri | spent a |1 decade | and had made 15 separate |1 attempts | to recruit the necessary |1 expertise | to weaponize |1 anthrax | in Russia and the Middle East .
"The US Army recipe was not used , and obtaining the unprocessed Ames |1 strain | of anthrax used does not warrant the |1 weight | given |1 it | by some press accounts ."
"There was lax |0 control | over the distribution of the Ames strain that was used , especially in light of the fact that transfers were not even required to be recorded prior to 1997 ."
"Significantly , the |0 individual | |0 who | isolated |1 it | nearly a quarter century ago ( now retired ) , upon being contacted , does not even report that |0 he | necessarily sent the only |1 copy | of the strain to Ft. Detrick ."
|0 Senator | Patrick Leahy at a Congressional hearing in the Spring of 2002 noted that the |0 FBI | had collected the Ames |1 strain | from 20 sources .
"In Fall 2004 , |0 MSNBC | , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the |0 FBI | has narrowed the |1 pool | of labs known to have had |1 Ames | |0 that | was a match from 16 to 4 but can not rule out that it was made overseas ."
Al Qaeda 's anthrax production |0 plans | on Khalid Mohammed 's computer did not evidence |1 knowledge | of advanced techniques in the most efficient biological weapons .
"At least according to the public comments by bioweaponeer experts William Patrick and Kenneth Alibek , under the optimal method , there is no electrostatic |0 charge | ."
"In the case of the anthrax used in the mailings , there was an electrostatic |0 charge | ."
"Although there was a |0 dominance | of single spores and a trillion spore concentration , there were |0 clumps | as large as 40 - 100 microns ."
( |0 Spores | must be no bigger than 5 microns to be inhalable . )
|0 Many | point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary .
"It is far simpler , however , to achieve a trillion spore |1 concentration | in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab ."
"The "" trillion spore "" |0 issue | was at the heart of a lot of mistaken theories of the matter concluding that state sponsorship was necessarily indicated ."
"The reported |0 finding | at Dugway undermines the |1 argument | of both the "" bomb |1 Iraq | "" crowd and the liberals focused on Dr. Steve Hatfill |0 who | object to US biodefense research because |0 they | view |1 it | as being useful for offensive purposes ."
"USDA employee |0 Johnelle | Bryant first told |1 us | , in sensational detail , of Atta 's inquiries about purchasing and retrofitting a |1 cropduster | ."
|0 Khalid | Mohammed then told |1 interrogators | that Zacarias Moussaoui 's |0 inquiries | about crop dusting may have related to Yazid Sufaat 's anthrax manufacturing plans .
"Although the |0 details | of the documents on Mohammed 's computer may ( or may not ) point to possible difficulties in aerial dispersal , |0 they | are fully consistent with the product used in the anthrax mailings ."
Al |0 Qaeda | had both the |1 means | and opportunity .
US - trained Malaysian biochemist |0 Yazid | Sufaat met with 9/11 plotters and two hijackers in January 2000 .
"|0 Sufaat | was a member of Al Qaeda and a member of Jemaah Islamiah ( "" JI "" ) ."
|0 JI | has |1 ties | with the Moro Front .
|0 Sufaat | used his |1 company | called Green Laboratory Medicine to buy |1 items | useful to Al Qaeda .
"( |0 Green | symbolizes "" |1 Islam | "" and Prophet Mohammed 's holy war ) ."
"|0 Zacarias | Moussaoui , |0 who | had a crop dusting |1 manual | when he was arrested , stayed at Sufaat 's condominium in 2000 when |0 he | was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia ."
"|0 Yazid | Sufaat provided |1 Moussaoui | with a letter indicating that |0 he | was a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provided |2 him | |1 $ | 35,000 ."
"The crop |0 dusters | were to be part of a "" second wave . """
"After 9/11 , |0 Yazid | Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his |1 work | with anthrax ."
"As described in US News , a former |0 reporter | from the Kabul Times actually may have met |1 Sufaat | , without realizing |1 it | , while traveling near Kabul in October 2001 , perceiving |1 him | as Filipino ."
The |0 fellow | was carrying |1 papers | from Zawahiri and bragging about his ability to manipulate |1 anthrax | .
Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 upon his return to Malaysia .
"|0 Newsweek | reported that a "" second wave "" involving biological |1 attacks | had been thwarted upon the arrest of Al Qaeda members who had been intended to provide logistical |1 support | ."
"Various doctors , both foreign and American , are associated with Al Qaeda leaders or operatives , to include the |1 doctors | Abdul Qadoos Khan , a bacteriologist from Rawalpindi and Aafia Siddiqui , PhD , from Karachi ."
"Microbiologist Abdul Qadoos Khan was charged along with his son , Ahmed , for harboring the |1 fugitives | ."
"As of March 28 , 2003 , |0 he | was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "" pre-arrest |1 bail | . """
"Yet |0 all | |0 you | read about at the time was the arrest of the son Ahmed Abdul Qadoos , |0 who | receives a |1 stipend | from the UN for being officially low - IQ due to lead poisoning ."
"It was |0 Khalid | Mohammed who told |1 authorities | about Aafia Siddiqui , |0 who | has a |1 PhD | from Brandeis in neurology ."
The Pakistani |0 press | reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003 .
"If mistaken , how did those |0 reports | first come about ?"
"Understandably , |0 Amerithrax | is a confidential investigation ."
The Pakistan |0 ISI | and CIA rarely grant press |1 interviews | in connection with an ongoing manhunt .
The |0 CIA | did not even allow the |2 FBI | |1 access | to KSM for 10 days after his arrest .
"As agent |0 Van | Harp , then head of the Amerithrax investigation said , the |0 information | coming from Khalid Mohammed is classified with the |0 authorities | releasing only certain limited |1 information | ."
"While |0 it | 's not easy to separate |1 fact | from fiction , Attorney General |0 Ashcroft | and Director Mueller have publicly confirmed Aafia is still being sought ."
|0 They | would know .
Her |0 mother | Ismat last saw |1 Aafia | and her grandchildren before |0 they | left in a minicab at the end of March .
|0 Aafia | was on her way with her children to visit and |1 uncle | and a friend in Islamabad .
"According to the Pakistan reports , Aafia Siddiqui was detained after being spotted at Karachi International airport ( after she was followed to a relative 's house ) ."
( |0 Karachi | is in the south ) .
"The |0 reports | say she is suspected of having been a member of Al Qaeda 's "" Chemical Wire Group . """
The family 's |0 lawyer | advises |1 me | that |0 Aafia | did not have enough |1 money | to pay for airfare tickets for herself and the kids and called |1 Ismat | from the train station .
|0 That | was the last |0 Ismat | heard from her .
|0 Aafia | never reached the uncle 's |1 house | .
"Perhaps |0 something | got lost in the translation , but the |0 phrase | "" Chemical Wire Group "" has appeared in all the english Pakistan and India papers ."
The family 's |0 attorney | advises |1 me | that |0 Aafia | had no |1 knowledge | of chemicals ( and |0 that | would not appear to be her training ) .
"There still is a very hot |0 pursuit | of the "" Atta - level "" Floridian , Adnan El Shukrijumah , |1 who | Siddiqui is thought to have known and been assisting ."
"His |0 nickname | is "" Jafar the Pilot . """
A senior DOJ |0 official | reports that |0 Adnan | has |1 experience | as a commercial pilot .
"He is said by one FBI agent to be "" very , very , very "" dangerous ."
|0 He | allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which |0 KSM | and Sufaat were present .
"He may have been seen in Hamilton , Canada -- along with Egyptian al - Maati , |0 who | apparently also has received pilot |1 training | ."
The United |0 States | truly no longer has |1 time | for faulty analysis or politically - based preconceptions .
"In early June 2003 , a CIA |0 report | concluded that the |0 reason | for Atta 's and Zacarias Moussaoui 's inquiries into cropdusters was in fact for the contemplated use in dispersing biological |1 agents | such as anthrax ."
It has long been known |0 Osama | Bin Laden was interested in using |1 cropdusters | to disperse biological |1 agents | ( since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam ) .
The |0 hijacker | Ahmed Alhaznawi appears to have contracted cutaneous |1 anthrax | in Afghanistan .
It is reasonable to credit his |1 statement | that |0 he | got the |1 lesion | after bumping into a suitcase |0 he | was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan .
The |0 lesion | is further evidence of Al Qaeda 's anthrax production program at Kandahar .
The present |0 evidence | relating to Atta 's alleged travel to Prague does not warrant a |1 conclusion | that Al |0 Qaeda | obtained the Ames |1 strain | from Iraq .
"|0 Iraq | , however , remains a possible source of the Ames ."
Former Russian bioweaponeer |0 Ken | Alibek has said that a key Russian |0 scientist | assisted |1 Iraq | and that |0 Russia | had the Ames |1 strain | .
"( His |0 conclusion | may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate "" Curveball "" , |1 which | |0 Alibek | divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design ) ."
|0 Zawahiri | did travel to Baghdad in 1998 with an entourage to attend the birthday |1 party | of Saddam 's son .
"The |0 papers | found at headquarters of the Mukhabarat , Iraq 's secret police , show that an entourage from Al Qaeda group was sent to the Iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan ."
"According to at least some reports , |0 Bin | Laden rejected the |1 suggestion | of a closer alliance -- preferring to pursue his own |1 concept | of jihad ."
"Two top Iraqi |0 scientists | , code named Charlie and Alpha , are helping the |1 coalition | to learn |1 more | about Iraqi 's anthrax program , according to Dr. David Kay , head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD ."
|0 He | has said that the |0 Iraqis | made surprising |1 innovations | in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize |1 anthrax | .
"The media |0 coverage | has been seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason Senators Daschle and Leahy would have been targeted -- tending to simplistically view |1 them | as "" liberals . """
"|0 Zawahiri | likely targeted |1 Senators | Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax |1 letters | , in addition to various media outlets , because of the appropriations made pursuant to the "" Leahy Law "" to military and security forces ."
That |0 money | has prevented the militant |1 islamists | from achieving their |1 goals | .
"Al Qaeda |0 members | and sympathizers feel that the FBI 's |0 involvement | in countries like Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , Indonesia , and the Philippines interferes with the sovereignty of those countries ."
"According to a post |0 she | made on the internet , |0 Aafia | Siddiqui expressed the same |1 sentiment | in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan ."
|0 Senator | Leahy was Chairman of both the Judiciary Committee overseeing the |1 FBI | and Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these countries .
"In late September 2001 , it was announced that the |0 President | was seeking a blanket |1 waiver | |0 that | would lift all |1 restrictions | on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant |1 islamists | ."
"This |0 extradition | and imprisonment of Al Qaeda leaders , along with US support for Israel and the Mubarak government in Egypt , remains foremost in the mind of Dr. Zawahiri ."
"At the height of the development of his biological weapons program , his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "" Albanian returnees "" case ( now |0 he | faces |1 retrial | ) ."
"|0 It | 's hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations , debt forgiveness , and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan ."
Those |0 appropriations | pale in comparison to the many tens of billions in appropriations relating to the invasion of Iraq .
Al |0 Qaeda | had a |1 motive | in mind .
"In his Fall 2001 book titled |1 Knights | under the Banner of the Prophet , |0 Zawahiri | argued that the secular |0 press | was telling "" |1 lies | "" about the militant islamists -- to include the |1 suggestion | that the militant |0 islamists | were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the |1 Russians | from Afghanistan ."
|0 Zawahiri | argued instead that |0 they | have been active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the resulting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel .
The anthrax letters were sent on the date of the Camp David Accord and then the date Anwar Sadat was assassinated as if to underscore the |1 point | to anyone paying |1 attention | .
"|0 Most | of the "" talking heads "" on television , however , knew only that |0 Daschle | and Leahy were liberal democrats and did not know |1 anything | of Al Qaeda beyond |1 what | |0 they | read in the US newspapers ."
The FBI 's |0 profile | includes a US - based |1 supporter | of the militant islamists .
"Attorney General |0 Ashcroft | explained that an "" either - or "" |0 approach | is not useful ."
"The |0 media | has tended to overlook the |1 fact | that when the |0 FBI | uses the |1 word | "" domestic "" the |0 word | includes a US - based , highly - educated |1 supporter | of the militant islamists ."
"There is an emerging |0 consensus | that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI , the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a |1 Star | of David and proposing |1 marriage | ."
"A |0 report | by the Center for Disease Control of interviews with AMI employees ( as well as detailed interviews by author Leonard Cole ) supports the |1 conclusion | that there were not one , but two , such |0 mailings | containing |1 anthrax | ."
( The |0 letters | were to different AMI publications -- |0 one | to the National Enquirer and |0 another | to The Sun ) .
( News assistant |0 Bobby | Bender recalls the |1 letter | containing the |1 items | to have been addressed to The Sun . )
"This |0 tactic | of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri , |0 it | is their signature ."
"The |0 islamists | sent letter |1 bombs | in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington , D.C. ."
"They were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik , Sheik Abdel Rahman ."
"The former leader of the Egyptian Al - Gamaa al - Islamiya ( "" Islamic Group "" ) , |0 he | was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda ."
The letter bombs were sent in connection with the treatment of the Egyptian islamists imprisoned for the earlier attack on the WTC and a related plot .
The |0 purpose | of the letter bombs -- |0 which | resulted in minimal casualty -- was to send a |1 message | .
"( There initially was an outstanding $ 2 million |0 reward | -- under the rewards for justice program , the |0 reward | now is up to $ 5 million . ) ."
There was no |0 claim | of responsibility .
There was no |0 explanation | .
"Once one had been received , the next ten , mailed on two separate dates , were easily collected ."
Sound familiar ?
"Two bombs were also sent to Leavenworth , where a key WTC 1993 defendant was imprisoned , addressed to "" Parole Officer . """
( The |0 position | does not exist ) .
"Abdel Rahman 's son was captured in Quetta , Pakistan in mid-February 2003 ."
"That |0 arrest | in turn led to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed , Al Qaeda 's # 3 ."
|0 Mohammed | allegedly was hiding in the home of the Pakistani bacteriologist Dr. Abdul Qadoos Khan .
"Along with Zawahiri , |0 Abdel | Rahman and his two sons have had considerable |1 influence | over Bin Laden ."
|0 He | reportedly treated |1 them | like sons .
"Although while in jail in the early 1980s , |0 Zawahiri | caused considerable |1 tension | by challenging the blind sheik 's |1 ability | to lead a |1 coalition | of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Egyptian Islamic Group , |0 Zawahiri | and OBL are Rahman 's friends ."
The imprisoned WTC 1993 |0 plotter | Yousef was KSM 's nephew .
"Thus , the |0 leaders | in charge of Al Qaeda 's anthrax production program had a close |1 connection | to those imprisoned in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center ."
"According to the controversial "" Feith memo , "" |0 which | summarized purported |1 intelligence | showing an Iraqi / Al Qaeda |1 connection | , |0 Osama | Bin Laden had asked Iraqi |1 intelligence | for technical assistance in sending letter |1 bombs | a half year before the Al Hayat letters were sent ."
Just because Al |0 Qaeda | likes its truck |1 bombs | and the like to be effective does not mean |0 they | do not see the |1 value | in a deadly missive .
"As |0 Brian | Jenkins once said , "" |0 terrorism | is theater . """
A |0 sender | purporting to be islamist sent |1 cyanide | in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 .
"There 's even a |0 chapter | titled "" Poisonous |1 Letter | "" in the Al Qaeda manual ."
"The "" Federal Eagle "" |0 stamp | used in the anthrax mailings was a blue - green ."
"It was widely published among the militant islamists that |0 martyrs | go to paradise "" in the hearts of green birds . """
"In the very interview in which |0 they | admitted |1 9/11 | , and described the |1 codes | used for the four targets for the planes , the |0 masterminds | admitted to the Jenny code , the code for representing the |1 date | 9/11 , and used the |1 symbolism | of the "" Green Birds . """
"|0 Osama | Bin Laden later invoked the |1 symbolism | in his video "" The 19 Martyrs . """
"A |0 FAQ | on the Azzam Publications website explained that "" In the Hearts of Green Birds "" refers to what is inside ."
"The mailer 's |0 use | of "" Greendale School "" as the return address for the letters to the Senators is also revealing ."
"A May 2001 |0 letter | |1 that | |0 Zawahiri | sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that |0 Zawahiri | used "" |1 school | "" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence ."
|0 Green | symbolizes |1 Islam | and was the Prophet Mohammed 's color .
"By Greendale School , the anthrax |0 perp | was being cute , just as |0 Yazid | Sufaat was being cute in naming his |1 lab | Green Laboratory Medicine ."
""" |0 Dale | "" means "" river |1 valley | . """
"|0 Greendale | likely refers to green river valley -- i.e. , Cairo 's Egyptian Islamic Jihad or the Islamic Group ."
"The |0 sender | probably is announcing that |0 he | is of either Egyptian Islamic Jihad , Egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad - al Qaeda , |0 which | is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda ."
"At the Darunta complex where |0 jihadis | trained , |0 recruits | would wear green |1 uniforms | , except for Friday when they were washed ."
In a Hadith the |0 Messenger | of Allah explains that the |0 souls | of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds |0 that | fly wherever |0 they | please in the Paradise .
"As to opportunity , though seldom reported , there is a |0 wealth | of "" open source "" information about possible Al Qaeda or Egyptian Islamic Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Group in the United States and Canada ."
The public |0 information | mostly relates to those suspected sleepers who have been detained or |0 who | are at large and are being sought .
"Zawahiri 's |0 mission | in the United States in 1995 was to do |1 spadework | for terrorism , not fundraising for charitable causes ."
|0 He | traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed .
What |1 mosques | exactly did |0 they | visit and |1 who | did |0 they | meet ?
"Whatever your political persuasion , the |0 FBI | and CIA deserve our |1 support | ."
"|0 We | are , after all , in this together ."
"First , the |0 nature | of such an investigation is that |0 we | lack sufficient |1 information | to second - guess ( or even know ) |1 what | the |0 FBI | is doing ."
Media |0 reports | are a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good sources .
"Second , |0 hindsight | is 20 / 20 ."
"Third , with the "" new age "" |0 Efrem | Zimbalist , Jr. in charge of the investigation , |0 it | is not likely |0 we | could do better in striking the appropriate |1 balance | between due process and national security ."
"Finally , the "" |0 Hatfill | theory "" seems to have been exhausted or at least lost public |1 favor | ."
"The "" |0 Hatfill | theory "" accusing |1 Dr. | Stephen Hatfill was always highly dubious ."
"The suspicion was founded on many false premises , and there was no reliable publicly known |0 evidence | indicating his |1 guilt | ."
The FBI 's |0 fixation | on Hatfill ( at least as rumored by some reporters ) may have stemmed from a warning by one Senator that |0 careers | hung in the balance .
Leahy 's |0 chief | of staff apparently started with the strong predisposition that some right - |0 winger | was involved because two liberal democrats had been targeted .
The |0 Hatfill | theory -- to include ongoing |1 interviews | and ongoing 7 / 24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit .
A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004 .
The |0 judge | had agreed to delay the civil rights |1 matter | from proceeding until at least October 2004 .
"The |0 judge | , frustrated by the apparent lack of progress , encouraged that the |0 parties | reach a negotiated |1 compromise | |0 that | would permit some limited |1 discovery | to proceed ( and the |0 judge | has directed that the |1 government | to file an |1 Answer | to the Complaint ) ."
"The Hatfill Theory ironically might best be understood as an Al Qaeda theory , with a coincidental Malaysian connection adding to the other circumstances ."
"Given the regrettable leaks that |0 he | was under suspicion , it is only fair that the |0 FBI | leak with equal enthusiasm the |1 fact | that Dr. Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when |0 that | proves to be the case ."
A |0 search | of Dr. Ken Berry 's residences likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory .
Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the |0 searches | were for the purpose of excluding |1 him | as much as including |1 him | .

Michael :
Appreciate the |1 idea | .
"However , with my natural long , |0 I | 'm not looking to really trade around the position ."

|0 I | was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking |0 it | might be an opportunity to buy back the |1 calls | |0 you | sold .

Not yet .
Did |0 you | happen to sign your employment |1 agreement | ?
Please respond to request below .
Thanks .
|0 John | Lavorato has requested the attached |1 report | .
"|0 He | is concerned about the allocation amongst categories - in particular , Real Time Traders ."
"If |0 you | would , please review the entire |1 list | and let |1 me | know if |0 you | are in agreement with the presentation by tomorrow evening , if possible ."
|0 I | 'm at x if |0 you | have any |1 questions | .
Thanks !
"|0 I | understand |1 all | of those comparisons , however , the |0 reality | is if |0 we | lose |1 Dean | ( which |0 we | will if |0 we | do n't pay 65 k + 10 |1 k | ) , |0 we | will end up hiring a |1 replacement | at 75 - 80 k ."
|0 This | is pretty easy math for me .
"|0 I | know |0 it | seems like a stretch , but the |0 market | for hourly traders is very strong right now ."
|0 I | would like to get |1 this | done ASAP .
Thanks .
|0 I | am reviewing the |1 request | for an employment agreement renewal on Mark Dean Laurent .
|0 Juan | communicated some |1 numbers | to me and when reviewing this |1 request | would like to ask |2 you | to consider |1 the | following :
"Current Salary : $ 47,500"
Job Group : Specialist
YE PRC Rating : Satisfactory
Original Proposition :
Base Salary 65 k
1 Year Agreement
"$ 5,000 signing"
Revised Proposal :
Base Salary : 55 k
1 Year agreement
"$ 5,000 signing"
"Business Case : If |0 we | offered |2 Dean | 55 |1 k | or 60 k |0 it | would still constitute a over a $ 10,000 |1 increase | ( approximately 25 % ) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level ."
"Also , the |0 top | of the salary range for a specialist is 66 k ."
|0 It | would still give |2 him | |1 room | to progress in the current job group should he not be promoted .
"Secondly , |0 he | will still out price |1 performers | |1 that | |0 you | have in the same job group |0 that | are excellent and strong performers respectively eg. Paul Thomas , Jason Choate , Todd DeCook and Peter Makkai ."
Salary Listing in Job Group :
"Maria Valdes superior $ 62,500"
"Paul Thomas excellent $ 55,008"
"Jason Choate excellent $ 60,008"
"Todd DeCook strong $ 42,008"
"Peter Makkai strong $ 47,500"
Let |1 me | know your |1 thoughts | .... then |0 I | will run |1 it | by Oxley .
Are |0 we | going to attend ?

|0 I | have a few |1 entities | |0 that | may need to change |1 groups | or be assigned to a group .
18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC
"This |0 entity | is not in TIS , SAP , nor Hyperion ."
"The 2000 tax |0 return | has no |1 income | , assets , or liabilities ."
"There is a corporate data |0 sheet | for this company , but this |0 entity | seems to have been inactive since it 's creation ."
86M - Enron Net Works LLC
"Despite the name , this |0 entity | appears to be a MTM company ."
"Per September financials , this |0 company | has about |1 $ | 3 M of MTM and about $ 8 K of expenses , nothing else ."
"The next 5 |0 companies | were my responsibility while in EBS , and did not get assigned during the reorg ."
"80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition , Inc ."
"This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications ( now Enron WarpSpeed Services , Inc. 83N ) , and then dissolved upon completion of merger ."
"|0 Company | is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities , but no I/S items ."
|0 83N | is my responsibility .
|0 I | think this |0 entity | should stay with 83N .
So |0 I | suggest it be assigned to Leon .
|0 It | should be 4 - easy .
1579 - EBS Network Co. Division of 17H .
This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group .
Not currently on our list of companies .
|0 I | think |0 this | could go to either Holding / Administrative Companies ( Same as 17H ) or Network & Services ( Leon ) .
4 - easy .
1691 - EPI - EBS Europe
Set up last month to centralize merchant asset |1 activities | .
Broke out the |1 activities | of 1179 .
A similar entity ( 1179 ) was assigned to Commodity and Trade ( Todd Richards and Mary Fischer ) so this one should be assigned to them as well .
4 - easy .
"1307 - EBIC - Apache , LLC"
"Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF , a CFC ."
Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ) .
Maybe this |0 one | should also go to them as the only |0 tax | |0 which | may have to be provided would be foreign tax .
4 - easy .
"1689 - EPI - EBS Ventures , LLC"
Set up last month to centralize merchant asset |1 activities | .
Broke out the |1 activities | of 1307 .
Same as 1307 .
It should be assigned to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ) .
4 - easy .
Let |1 me | know if |0 you | have any |1 questions | .

Hello .
|0 I | was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist |1 lithograph | .
"|0 I | found |1 them | and purchased |1 both | from a gallery in London , William Weston ."
They should be delivered this week .
|0 They | are beautiful and will add a |1 lot | to our collection .
By the way the |0 Lichtenstein | is up and hanging in our formal living room and |0 it | is magnificent .
|0 I | have also purchased an |1 Appel | in the last month .
|0 I | am interested in several artists .
"Actually , a lot ."
|0 I | will be looking for one or more of the following .
My |0 concept | is that over time |0 I | would like to own |1 one | of all the following artists and |0 they | are all depending when |0 I | find |1 something | |1 that | |0 we | really like .
|0 I | listed |1 all | of our ( sometimes mine vs. my wife 's favorites and priorities ) .
|0 They | are kind of in rank order but as |0 I | stated if |0 I | find the |1 piece | |1 that | |0 I | like |0 we | will purchase |1 it | .
|0 I | want |1 signed | and numbered .
|0 I | realize that some were not signed by the artist but |0 it | is an important fact in my buying decision .
|0 I | also realize that |0 some | may not have done any |1 works | on paper or |0 they | are outrageously expensive .
"For example , |0 I | would like to know if |0 Rothko | or Kline did any |1 work | on paper ."
At least |0 that | is what |0 I | am thinking now .
Bonnard ( colorful only )
Lautrec
Suerat ( any works on paper ? -
|0 I | do n't know that |0 he | did |1 any | )
Other impressionist or post impressionist lithos
Braque
Moore
Arp
Rouault
Modrian
Rothko
Kline
Motherwell
"By the way , |0 I | am interested in re-looking at a Picasso ( although |0 we | have |1 2 | ) |1 that | your |0 gallery | had a couple of years ago ."
"|0 It | was a cubist piece from the 1920s and |0 I | believe |0 you | called the |1 technique | a "" push wa "" ( pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling ) ."
"|0 It | was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $ 20,000 ."
Is there |0 1 | available ?
"Also |0 I | am still thinking about the Matisse |0 we | discussed before but as |0 you | can see , |0 I | have a |1 lot | of other artists |0 I | am interested in and |0 it | may remain on the back burner because |0 we | already have |1 one | ."

fyi / review / comment
|0 I | have a |1 couple | of questions so |0 I | can wrap up the |1 LOI | :
|0 We | refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment .
"Do |0 we | intend to reference a particular |1 manufacturer | , or should |0 this | be more generic ?"
"Do |0 we | want to attach a |1 draft | of the Development Agreement , and condition the final |1 deal | on agreeing to terms substantially the same as |0 what | 's in the draft ?"
|0 I | have a |1 concern | that the Enron optionality |0 bug | could bite |1 us | on the backside with that one .
"Do |0 we | expect to have ONE EPC |1 contract | , or several ?"
"|0 I | 'm looking for the confidentiality agreement , |0 which | may be in Bart 's files ( have n't checked closely yet ) ."
"If |0 anyone | has |1 it | handy , |0 it | could speed |1 things | up for me ."
"Thanks ,"

Forget the ONE or more contract |1 questions | .
|0 I | see |0 we | expect to have separate |1 contracts | for each project .
|0 I | have a |1 couple | of questions so |0 I | can wrap up the |1 LOI | :
|0 We | refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment .
"Do |0 we | intend to reference a particular |1 manufacturer | , or should |0 this | be more generic ?"
"Do |0 we | want to attach a |1 draft | of the Development Agreement , and condition the final |1 deal | on agreeing to terms substantially the same as |0 what | 's in the draft ?"
|0 I | have a |1 concern | that the Enron optionality |0 bug | could bite |1 us | on the backside with that one .
"Do |0 we | expect to have ONE EPC |1 contract | , or several ?"
"|0 I | 'm looking for the confidentiality agreement , |0 which | may be in Bart 's files ( have n't checked closely yet ) ."
"If |0 anyone | has |1 it | handy , |0 it | could speed |1 things | up for me ."
"Thanks ,"
Kay
"On the issue of the contracts , the |0 draft | says that the $ 170 m is paid when the EPC contract is signed ."
Are |0 we | expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed ?
"Thanks ,"
Kay
"1 . The |0 pricing | |1 that | |0 we | have given |2 CRRA | is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the |1 manufacturer | ( i.e. , |0 ONSI | would be a lot more money ) ."
"Hence , |0 I | think that |0 we | have to reference the |1 manufacturer | ."
2 . The |0 attachment | of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question .
"In order to mark any 2000 |1 income | , |0 we | will need to get |1 CRRA | to execute the Development |1 Agreement | in 2000 ."
"In my opinion , |0 we | should show |2 CRRA | a |1 copy | of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached ."
|0 I | would actually send |2 them | the draft Development |1 Agreement | a couple days after the LOI .
"Based on how |0 CRRA | reacts , |0 I | would make an ultimate |1 determination | if the |0 agreement | needs to be attached to the LOI ."
3 . |0 I | expect at least one EPC |1 contract | per project .
|0 We | do n't want to condition the |1 acceptance | of one project on the performance of another project .
Performance tests will either be performed on a project basis or a unit by unit basis in a given project .
Remarkably clear explanation .

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle 's help ) |0 I | have pulled together a one page communication |1 note | on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ) .
|0 We | are in the final stages of this process - where |0 we | draft a cover |1 letter | for John |0 which | will introduce |1 this | for inclusion within Globalflash ( the Enron Europe newsletter )
Have |0 you | any |1 thoughts | on draft or cover note ?
Mike
Late |0 Jan | sounds great .
"|0 Meagan | does have a |1 couple | of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior |1 Presentation | ( big dance that |0 she | and I are committed to help with ) , the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion ."
"|0 I | believe that |0 these | are three weekends in a row , January 6 , 13 and 20th ."
So the last |0 weekend | in January would work well ( and |0 I | will need a |1 rest | from formal affairs ! ) .
Does |0 that | work for you ?
And do |0 you | want to do |1 it | on a Saturday or Sunday ?
"|0 Saturday | probably works better for me , just so that |0 I | am back in Houston and doing |1 laundry | by Sunday afternoon !!"
Hi ...
Talked to the little mother - to - be .
|0 She | said a |0 shower | would be grand .
|0 She | has some big |1 presentation | mid-January .
How does late |0 January | sound to you .
Should |0 we | set a |1 date | now ?
Am |0 I | turning into Mother ?

"|0 I | think that it is a great idea to get some |1 press | regarding our fundamental operating standards , but |0 I | wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough of a global message and the means of delivery ."
"On the means of delivery , |0 I | am not sure from your note whether or not |0 I | fully understand the |1 intent | ."
"Is there an |0 article | to be included in an Enron publication and in addition is a letter to be sent under John 's name ( if so , to whom will the letter be sent ) ?"
Or is the |0 letter | from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article ?
"With regard to a global message , |0 I | think that |0 one | of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where |0 we | engage in trading activities ."
"With these operating |1 standards | implemented worldwide , |0 we | will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and |0 we | will be able to ensure Enron top |1 management | that there is |0 consistency | in operating standards worldwide ."
"These global |0 standards | also should enable |1 Enron | to expand its business |1 reach | more quickly , with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations ."
|0 I | am not sure from the article as written that the global |0 nature | of this effort comes across .
"Finally , a question regarding timing ."
The |0 last | |0 I | knew after |0 you | and Brent drafted this starting |1 point | for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( |0 Shona | took |1 this | to do after Brent 's return to Houston ) for comments to all business controllers .
"|0 I | do n't believe that |0 we | are quite at the point that |0 we | can say that all business |0 controllers | worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these |1 standards | ."
"And not to belittle the |1 process | of creating the |1 standards | , the tough |0 part | ( and the real meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards ."
My |0 commitment | to Rick Causey is that |0 I | will have that global |1 report | in production by the end of the year .
There is much |0 work | to do in defining the |1 content | and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable |1 sources | of data for compiling the |1 report | .
"|0 Shona | has commissioned |1 Mike | Moscoso to work on this , and |0 I | believe that |0 Mike | has already been working with James New ."
So |0 I | question whether or not |0 you | want to publish |1 info | about fundamental standards that |0 we | can not yet report against .
Would a more appropriate |0 time | be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when |0 we | should have worldwide buy - |1 in | and commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful exception report ?
Sorry that this |0 response | looks so long .
"I have been interrupted 20 times while responding , so |0 I | hope that |0 it | makes |1 sense | ."
Thanks for sharing |1 this | with me .
"Since |0 you | asked for input , |0 I | hope that |0 you | do n't mind that |0 I | gave |2 you | |1 some | ."

Steve :
"At this point , our IT |0 contacts | are backpedalling a bit and suggesting |0 they | can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server |1 problems | ."
"There are still four important |0 issues | , however :"
|0 IT | still can not commit to transferring |1 messages | across domains .
|0 This | means that |0 messages | initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business |1 units | outside the Corp domain .
"No |0 messages | will reach the EES |1 organization | unless |0 IBM | agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery |1 tool | , WebSphere , and will use |1 WebLogic | instead ."
"WebLogic is required by BackWeb , although it is designed by a separate company ."
"|0 HR | , intended to be a key user of this tool , will not use |1 BackWeb | because survey responses can not be made anonymous ."
|0 HR | has already purchased a |1 tool | called CONFIRMIT |0 that | can execute anonymous |1 surveys | .
"Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain , nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator ."
"Another |0 thing | to consider is that these |0 messages | will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time , meaning |0 users | can not retrieve |1 them | and read |1 them | later ( as |0 they | can with e-mail ) ."
"|0 This | means that |0 I | could be away from the office for several days and miss a |1 message | entirely , because |0 it | would have expired and disappeared by the time |0 I | returned ."
"The plain |0 fact | is that a few |0 members | of IT are pushing this |1 initiative | , but |0 they | lack commercial |1 sponsorship | ."
|0 They | are hoping |0 Corp | will foot the |1 bill | for a pilot |0 which | will allow |1 them | to fully test this |1 tool | before implementing |1 it | company - wide .
Please let |1 us | know if |0 you | have additional |1 questions | .

|1 what | do |0 you | think ?
Joe_Lardy@cargill.com on 03/02/2001 10:39:03 AM
Currently |0 Cargill | and Enron have a 15 MM collateral |1 threshold | .
"If possible , |0 I | think the cleanest |0 way | to run this |1 biz | would be to put a |1 box | around the prime broker biz ."
|0 We | would still operate under the master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support |1 annex | for this biz .
"|0 We | would still keep the 20,000,000 |1 line | referenced in Schedule B of the POA agreement ."
The |0 line | in the POA is a seperate and distinct measure from the daily collateral .
The 20 |0 mill | reflects gross |1 exposure | .
Let |1 me | know if |0 you | think |0 this | is reasonable and workable .
"|0 We | too , are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron |0 relationships | are very important and a high priority to us ."
Thanks
Joe
Joe -
a few things regading the POA / Cargill |1 line | ..
|0 I | am going to find out how much |1 line | |0 we | currently have available ... |0 you | probably already have |1 this | .
"|0 We | should allocate a |1 piece | to Global |0 which | would solve the |1 problem | of other Cargill people using the |1 line | , putting |1 us | over the limit , without |0 me | knowing ..."
|0 We | could change the |1 language | of the POA to this ...
|0 we | will not go over Global 's piece of the Cargill line ...
|0 I | think |0 this | would solve our main |1 concern | ...
Please let |1 me | know ... |0 we | are eager to keep trading with Global and yourselves ...

Hello Janice :

|0 It | sounds as though his |0 health | has deteriorated significantly .

|0 He | is joining an excellent |1 company | .
|0 I | am also delighted to hear that |0 he | will continue his |1 education | working toward an MBA .
"As |0 we | are living in an age where intellectual |0 capital | is so valuable , it is important for every young |0 person | to obtain the very best possible |1 education | |0 they | can ."
"As to our family , within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a young man from Buenos Aires , Argentina ."
|0 They | met while |0 they | were both working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires .
"|0 They | 're currently on their honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to Miami , Florida ."
This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born .
It was born to our son David and his wife Courtney .
"|0 It | was a 7 lb. , 10 oz. , 20 inch little boy ."
So |0 we | now have three |1 grandsons | and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days .
|0 They | are a great deal of fun .
|0 We | are doing quite well .
"|0 I | am looking forward to seeing Ginger "" Rees "" |1 Copeland | when |0 she | comes to Houston ."

"However , |0 he | did suggest a couple slight |1 revisions | to protect Enron 's |1 interests | ."
1 ) Highlighting that information will only be provided |0 that | is related to enovate and 2 ) that each designated |0 representative | should sign an appropriate confidentiality |1 agreement | .
This language has been included in the attached draft .
"My |0 goal | , however optimistic , is to execute the risk |1 policy | by the end of today ."
|0 Activity | is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting further blurred each passing day .
"Therefore , |0 I | need to know ASAP if there are any |0 problems | with the draft as written ."

|0 I | 'm working on it now .

|0 I | can meet around 10:00 .
"That way , |0 we | can get |1 it | to them in time for weekend review ."

It was good to hear from you !
|0 We | had a nice |1 Thanksgiving | here too .
"|0 It | 's funny , because usually |0 it | 's just me , Mom , Craig and Danelia , and |0 Danelia | does n't really like roasted |1 turkey | or roast beef ( not that |0 she | would say |1 it | to me ! ) , so there is not just the same |0 joy | in cooking |0 it | would be elsewise ."
It was good having the |1 girls | down .
"|0 We | played a new |1 version | of Uno called "" African Uno "" |0 that | was complex , fast and at times , physically challenging ."
|0 It | 's not for the meek .
It was incredible what a good player |0 Alena | was .
|0 She | had her |0 cards | memorized as well as everyone else s ( when |0 you | play |0 you | 'll see why |0 you | can know everyone else s |1 hands | ! ) .
|0 I | expect |0 Craig | did n't want |1 Mom | to see his |1 place | because |0 it | was messy .
"|0 I | think compared to my house , |0 he | 's embarrased about his apartment ."
"Then , also , |0 he | 's got so much |1 stuff | in there right now , that |0 I | do n't know how |0 he | 's going to fit baby |1 stuff | ."
|0 They | would only give |2 him | a 6 month |1 lease | when |0 he | renewed his |1 lease | last month because |0 they | do n't want 3 |1 people | in that small apartment .
So |0 he | 's going to have to start looking for another place .
And his |0 apartment | is so run down down |0 I | 'm afraid |0 roaches | might be crawling over the baby .
|0 I | guess |0 Mom | is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new |1 baby | .
|0 You | 'll have to come visit to check out my new |1 house | .
"The upstairs "" guest |0 suite | "" is pretty neat ."
"It 's got its own |1 bathroom | and tv , and is pretty cozy ."
"As far as the |0 call | with Uncle Ben goes , if |0 he | was thrilled to hear from me |0 I | could n't tell by his voice ."
|0 It | was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us .
"But , |0 I | guess , |0 it | 's a start ..."
|0 I | 've already made my XMAS |1 plans | .
"|0 I | leave the evening of the 21st , my |0 flight | comes in about 10 pm , and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am ."
It 's good chatting with you .
Keep in touch !

Attached is the referenced agreement .
Let |1 me | know if the notice |0 information | is OK with you .
"If so , |0 I | 'll get |1 it | signed by Craig Breslau today , then bring |1 it | to you for countersignature ."
"Thinking about that , what 's your |0 title | ?"
|0 I | 'm not sure |0 you | have the |1 authority | to sign |1 documents | w/o special authority ...
"No , |0 it | does not mean |1 that | ."
"Adding all the Enron "" Specified |1 Entities | "" would only make a |1 default | under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement ."
Our |0 concern | is that |0 we | do n't want any trading related |1 defaults | to ever trigger a |1 default | under a loan transaction |0 which | has a |1 swap | as a component .
Richard Sage
11/30/2000 10:52 AM
"If |0 you | do add all the |1 entities | , does |0 that | mean that |0 we | would not need to put in place a separate |1 agreement | for ECCL ?"
"With respect to Deutsche Bank ( """" DB "" ) , |0 we | have one credit |0 issue | remaining , |0 DB | would like |1 us | to add all the Enron trading |1 entities | |0 DB | trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and |0 we | are somewhat hesitant to do so , as |0 this | could potentially roll up |1 swaps | under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement ."
|0 Sara | and Bill Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this remaining issue .
"With respect to First Union National Bank , the |0 draft | |0 we | were working from was so old that |0 they | agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11/8/00 for review ."
"|0 Sara | is working on that with Susan Bailey , another paralegal in our Group ."

"Hey there yourself ,"
Sorry |0 I | have n't written |1 you | guys in a while to keep |1 you | properly updated .
|0 I | am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and do n't think |0 I | 'm going to go at exactly the same time as my parents .
"As much fun as |0 they | are , |0 I | figured |0 we | would probably do some different |1 things | than |1 what | |0 you | have planned for them ."
"As for Ted , |0 things | are still going well although |0 I | have n't see |1 him | at all this week ( |0 we | are two very busy people ) ."
"But , |0 we | had a great laid back |1 day | last Saturday and |0 I | think have hit that comfortable |1 stage | ... |0 you | know , not quite so formal about dates etc ."
"In one sense |0 it | 's great , but |0 it | also makes |1 things | a lot harder to read ."
"Anyway , |0 I | 'm sure my |0 Mom | told |1 you | guys but |0 Travis | and Kathy got to meet |1 him | and |0 I | think |0 it | went well ."
"Hopefully , if |0 we | 're still dating come December , |0 you | and Chuck can meet |1 him | when |0 you | come back to visit ."
"|0 I | 'm planning on dragging |1 him | to at least one of the U.T. games , |0 I | just have to find out when |0 he | wants to go ( as well as properly prepare |1 him | for the Scott / Kelley / Parks / Wild Card gang and the full - day affair |0 that | is a U.T. game ) ."
|0 Things | in Houston are good and definitely warm .
"|0 I | went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "" |1 Rent | "" and |0 it | was wonderful ."
"Also , |0 I | 'm going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot 's |1 daughter | Julie ."
Needless to say |0 I | am very excited .
"Talk to you guys soon ,"
Susan
"Hey girlie ,"
How are |0 you | doing ?
Have n't heard from you in a while .
A little |0 birdie | told |2 me | that |0 you | were checking into tickets for Seoul .
Are |0 you | really ?
Would |0 you | come with your parents or separately ?
"In any case , |0 we | have had some more |1 time | to do some |1 exploring | ( and shopping ) , so |0 we | have some good |1 ideas | about |0 what | to do if |0 you | come ."
"|0 I | think that |0 we | will stay in Korea when your |0 parents | come and do the whole base |1 thing | ( |0 which | will take only a few |1 minutes | , actually ) , but are considering going to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving ."
|0 We | 'll do |1 whatever | |0 you | want want if |0 you | still are coming !
Let |1 us | know the |1 latest | with Ted and also with what 's going on in Houston .
"Take |1 care | ,"
Chris

"Hey Tonto ( a.k.a - the trusty , but silent , side - kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D )"
The play was very good and |0 I | think well received .
|0 I | 'd forgotten how blown away |0 I | was by some of the songs the first time |0 I | saw |1 it | in NY .
The cast |0 members | really have to have incredibly powerful |1 voices | to pull off a |1 few | of the most poignant numbers ( |0 I | think |0 this | could be your true calling ) .
"|0 I | caught the third |1 day | of Corey 's Jeopardy run last night here at the office ( yes , |0 I | had to come back after the play ... |0 I | love my |1 job | ! ) ."
"Anyway , |0 I | 'm sure |0 I | 'd mentioned |1 it | before but yes |0 she | is a very smart girl ."
"As a result of that , |0 she | has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial |1 Pursuit | or watching |1 Jeopardy | by absolutely obliterating |1 me | ( The |0 girl | actually did her senior |1 thesis | on Trivia ) ."
|0 Kori | told |2 me | |0 she | saw |1 you | last night at Steak Night and introduced |1 herself | since |0 I | failed to do so the last time |0 we | went .
|0 I | should let |1 you | know though that |0 she | was very offended this morning that |0 you | did n't spell her |1 name | right in the email - |0 I | mean |0 it | 's such a common spelling .
So was |0 Darren | there last night to meet |1 her | or do |0 you | just think |0 they | 'd make a good |1 match | ?
|0 She | 's a very fun girl .
Hope you |0 day | is going well and that the |0 move | to 30 went off without a hitch .
"Good luck with all of the "" fun "" meetings ."

|0 I | forgot to tell |2 you | that |0 I | saw your |1 friend | on a re-run Jeopardy the other night and |0 I | almost called |1 you | but |0 it | came on at 11:30 .
Smart girl .
|0 I | ran into Corey last night at LW s and |0 I | am thinking |0 this | is a girl for Darren .
"Anyway , lots of fun meetings today ."
|0 I | 'll talk to you later .
Maybe |0 you | should ignore the |1 sentiment | of the quote |0 I | sent earlier ...
|0 I | think |0 you | may be adhering to it too faithfully .
At this rate |0 we | may have to start pinning |1 notes | to your shirt to remind |1 you | to do |1 things | .
"However , having driven with you on several occasions |0 I | feel confident |0 you | will be able to pass the |1 test | with flying colors ."
"Keep in mind though that if |0 you | end up failing |0 I | will not let |1 you | forget |1 it | ( and , as |0 we | have established , |0 I | have the |1 memory | of an elephant ) ."
|0 I | 'll keep |1 discussion | of me to a minimum and just say that |0 things | are well on 32 .
Now back to what 's really important ... you .
Thought |0 you | 'd like to know that the Dixie |0 Chicks | are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center ... |0 it | 's all about you and your needs .

|0 This | is a two day process and all because |0 I | let my CA |1 license | expire .
|0 I | know |0 I | need |1 some | of your organizational skills .
|0 I | may try to run out and take the |1 test | this afternoon while I get moved to 30 ( |0 I | better not fail |1 it | ) .
How 's |0 life | on 32 today -- well |0 that | 's enough about you let |1 's | talk more about me .
There is no |0 pleasure | in having |1 nothing | to do ; the |0 fun | is in having |1 lots | to do and not doing |1 it | .

"As |0 you | know , the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies ."
"Therefore , any trade mark |0 registration | |0 that | incorporates the |1 word | ONLINE as a suffix in the way that |0 you | use |1 it | will not enable its |1 owner | to prevent |1 others | from using the |1 word | ONLINE ."
"Given the |1 above | , if |0 you | have adequate |1 protection | for the word ENRON ( |0 which | covers the |1 services | |1 that | |0 you | offer on - line as well as your core activities ) , |0 I | 'd say that another |0 application | for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary ."
"However , if |0 you | use a particular |1 logo | for the on - line service , that should be registered ."

Please find attached the most recent |1 update | for Merchanting Metals .
In summary the planned systems |0 changes | and manual substantiation efforts are behind schedule .

Please contact |1 me | if |0 you | require any additional |1 information |

"The |0 intention | of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( see attached |1 email | ) was to provide a robust position signoff |1 process | for total metal tonnage , spread and brand and location a timely substantiation of stock on balance sheet forward MTM debtors and creditor balances OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account"
"Despite the best efforts of IT , continuing |0 problems | with the AS400 application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports , and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that |0 I | am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate |1 information | to AA to satisfy their audit |1 requirements | - |0 which | at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values ."
"Consequently |0 I | need to inform |1 you | of , and / or require your |1 approval | for , the following :"
|0 I | will discuss with AA the |1 following |
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model simplifications )
"that there are reconciling |0 differences | between trader position analyses , AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable )"
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO |1 work | )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key Metals staff |0 who | continue to work exceptionally unsociable |1 hours | to meet the above stated |1 objectives |
The signoff for additional permanent ' Enron ' headcount |0 who | will ' duplicate ' certain key position control |1 processes | ultimately replacing some existing Traffic |1 staff |
A reconciling |0 difference | of $ 15 mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400 .
"|0 We | will continue to investigate potential |1 misstatements | in the system p&l , as a result of data or system valuation problems , within the month end reporting timeframe ."
"However , this |0 difference | may need to be adjusted for following a final |1 review | and signoff of system p&l values with traders ."
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated .
Middle Office |0 work | being prioritised is as follows
"the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic / co-ordination an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30th ( replacing planned 23rd |1 review | due to system issues ) , requiring full |1 download | of contract detail for later reference"
reconciliation of stock movements between 23rd and 30th sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position |1 analysis |
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors / creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd
|0 I | will be in touch directly re the items needing |1 approval |

Several related |0 issues | have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business .
"Complexities surrounding the |1 operation | of the Off Balance Sheet Facility ( "" OBSF "" ) |0 which | commenced two weeks before the year end ."
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA 's signoff for the facility late in the year end audit .
"The discovery of a number of ' bugs ' within the AS400 Merchanting code , arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality , |0 which | compounded the operational |1 burden | of supporting the |1 OBSF | ."
The requirement to amend the operational |1 process | and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ) .
The senior IT |0 developer | for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave .
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital |1 usage | for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues .
"Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide |1 focus | , gain |1 comfort | over control levels and to provide |1 assurance | to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet ."
The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - |0 benefit | is to provide sole |1 focus | on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers .
The AR / AP SAP data quality |0 reviews | for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed |1 analysis | as at end Q1 .
Middle |0 Office | have instigated a new daily working capital report |1 process | tracking cash |1 settlement | / funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses .
"An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 covering gross |1 tonnage | , spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations ."
"The necessary report |0 functionality | should be available within the AS400 , however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA / excel |1 reports | outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data |1 downloads | ."
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code |0 freeze | will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF .
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial |1 balances | between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable |0 which | incorporates
"A full circularisation of inventory balances , and matching to source documentation within Enron"
"Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances , by third party inspectors , where there is an |0 expectation | that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis"
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position |1 report | signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating |1 existence | of stock |1 that | |0 we | have |1 option | to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account
"A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation , where applicable , and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements"
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or external documentation ( invoices / request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts
|0 I | intend to provide weekly |1 updates | on the status of the above actions during April

Please send |2 me | an excel |1 spreadsheet | |0 which | depicts the |1 value | |1 that | |0 you | see associated with the heat rate spread option .
|0 I | want to make sure that |0 I | understand exactly how |0 you | propose valuing the |1 transaction | and how this value would be booked .
"As such , please provide the following |1 detail | :"
Will |0 we | be valuing / booking a |1 series | of monthly call options or a series of daily call options ?
What power curve are |0 we | valuing the |1 deal | against - PJM East or West |1 Hub | ?
Please send |2 me | the current fuel |1 curve | |1 that | |0 you | are converting to $ / MWh to value the |1 deal | ?
What |1 volatilities | are |0 you | using to value the |1 options | - monthly volatilities or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two ( if blending please show |2 me | what |1 formula | |0 you | using to blend the two |1 vols | ) ?
"What expiration |1 date | are |0 you | using , i.e. : for monthly call options the 15th of the relevant month , and for daily options ?"
"What |1 correlation | are |0 you | assuming , 15 % flat for twenty years ?"
Are |0 you | deducting all operating |1 expenses | from the value of the option ?
"Are |0 you | using the "" SPRDOPT "" Exotic Options |1 function | to value the |1 option | ?"
Are |0 you | using the $ / MWh VOM dollar |1 amount | as your strike ?
Has |0 Don | provided the fixed payment |1 stream | ?
This |0 stream | should be covering both |1 P&I | and not just principal .
"Yvan , and Ben , please provide |1 answers | to these question via written correspondence so that their is limited |0 probability | of misunderstanding ."
Thank |1 you | both very much for your time and help thus far .
"Furthermore , |0 I | would like to reiterate that RAC 's |0 goal | , prior to quoting any credit |1 reserve | , is to be 100 % confident that : ( i ) the |0 methodology | that is being employed is consistent among the internal groups ; and ( ii ) the inherent |0 value | of the price risk management contracts matches ."
|0 This | enables |1 RAC | to manage the associated |1 risk | during the life of the transaction both effectively and appropriately .

Would |0 you | please contact |1 Gerald | Nemec and review the Gallup Compression Service |1 Contract | in respect to the Load Control Management .
My |0 understanding | was that |0 ECS | was to provide a |1 means | to access CDEC 's online |1 profile | in order for |0 us | to make a |1 decision | to avoid running the |1 compressor | during CDEC 's peak load periods .
"|0 We | have not received |1 access | to this information |0 which | has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $ 200,987.33 for the period of July through September ."
"Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year , |1 that | |0 I | have not been able to review yet ."
"This |0 cost | is averaging |1 $ | 79,000 per month if |0 we | continue to run the |1 compressor | as |0 we | have in August and September ."
"Good point , but |0 I | 'm comfortable we 're covered because our |0 bidders | were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points ."
"They are deemed to be on notice that |0 they | had alternate point |1 rights | ( |0 it | s in the tariff ) and if |0 they | wanted to submit a |1 bid | |0 that | had a different |1 rate | for primaries and alternates , |0 they | could have done so ."
"|0 None | of them did , and most importantly , the winning |0 bidders | did not ."
Our letter |0 agreement | simply memorializes that |0 we | will charge the same negotiated |1 rate | whether the |0 gas | flows on primaries or alternates .
|0 I | assume from your message |0 you | are OK with this and |0 they | can get |1 it | nailed down ?
DF
I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and |0 it | specifically says that the max |0 rate | would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to .
"My |0 concern | with adding the |1 language | below is , could it be argued that not |0 everyone | knew the |0 rate | would or could apply at any point , since |0 we | just stated |1 Topack | and Needles and if |0 they | knew |0 they | might have bid a different |1 rate | ??"
Susan Scott
01/11/2001 02:42 PM
After discussions with the commercial group |0 I | propose that that redlined language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements |0 we | 've done .
If there are any |0 objections | |0 you | need to get back to me ASAP .

Jean & Thane --
Can |0 we | have a |1 meeting | this week ( maybe Thursday at 3:30 ) to discuss |1 this | ?
Jim
|0 We | do need a formal |1 plan | .
|0 We | have been working closely together to identify the |1 issues | as |0 they | develop and propose |1 solutions | .
|0 Doug | has been providing |1 us | with the necessary specific market information .
|0 We | have been successful in communicating that |1 information | to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking |1 resolution | .
"The |0 commission | is definitely more responsive to market participants |0 that | are articulating the |1 issue | , providing specific |1 examples | and proposing the |1 solution | ."
Grand - standing is ignored .
Those |0 who | show up with complaints but can not point to specifics are virtually ignored .
"Those |0 who | show up and complain , but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls , board meetings , etc. are ignored ."
|0 Doug | and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent |1 conversations | .
|0 Thane | and I also visited with him .
|0 Pat | Wood made a phone |1 call | to Tom Noel and told |1 him | to get the Texas |1 market | fixed .
"( Even though |0 he | has bigger |1 things | to do in D.C. , |0 this | is his legacy and |0 he | recognizes that if |0 deregulation | does not work in Texas , the |0 repercussions | could be global . )"
Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens ( of the Texas legislature ) are also engaged in market developments .
|0 We | have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping |1 them | apprised .
There is an Electric Restructuring Committee |0 hearing | scheduled for September 6th or 7th .
The forum is expected to be invited testimony only .
|0 Those | currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot 's Sam Jones and Tom Noel .
The hearing is focused on the pilot and |0 we | have an |1 opportunity | to provide some probing |1 questions | for |0 Wolens | to direct to Sam and Tom .
"Now that |0 Sibley | is not a candidate for Lt. Governor , there is more |0 freedom | to open up and ask some difficult |1 questions | ."
"|0 Thane | is in Austin on Friday , but is available by phone ."
|0 I | will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m .
Can |0 we | find another |1 time | |0 that | works for us to meet ?
|0 Thane | is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00 .
|0 I | am available after Rick 's Friday budget meeting ... are |0 you | available then ?
"|0 You | are right , |0 we | do need a formal |1 plan | , |0 Thane | has started an initial |1 draft | ."
"Thanks , Jean"
Jean & Thane --
"Walking out last night , |0 Kevin | Presto indicated that there were |0 games | being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and |0 prices | in certain markets were not reflective of working markets ."
|0 Enron | needs to use this |1 situation | to quickly get our |1 viewpoints | up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these |1 problems | and our proposed fixes .
If |0 ERCOT | goes the |1 way | of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - |0 it | will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood .
"As important , the new PUCT |0 Commissioners | need some |1 help | right now in messaging the |1 market | ."
Let |1 's | get |1 them | to support constructive |1 solutions | |0 that | will make a real |1 difference | .
"Jean and Thane , |0 I | think that |0 we | need a FORMAL |1 PLAN | on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this |1 situation | ."
|0 I | would like to discuss |1 this | with you on Friday am .
|0 I | am free at 8 am on Friday before Rick 's budget meeting .
Jim
FYI .
|0 You | may want to discuss with Becky .

"As an outgrowth of the meeting |0 Leslie | and I had with Scott and Hunter a couple of weeks ago , |0 we | have begun |1 work | to develop an electronic |1 tool | |0 that | would allow |2 us | to provide ongoing |1 summaries | of FERC gas activities , and possibly electric activities , in a format that can be linked to the Fundamentals intranet site used by the traders ."
"|0 We | envision a |1 format | |0 that | would provide a brief |1 summary | and analysis of the order , filing , etc. with a link to the source document as well for those |0 who | would like more detailed |1 information | ."
|0 This | would replace the paper |1 copies | |0 you | and your people are currently getting .
"Many |0 details | remain to be worked out , but |0 we | will keep |1 you | advised ."
"In the meantime , could |0 you | please provide a |1 contact | on your side with whom |0 we | could discuss technical |1 issues | ?"
|1 What | do |0 I | need to do ?

Bill -
"If Sam 's |0 description | below of the GCP procedure is correct , |0 it | looks to me like |0 something | needs to be changed ."
The |0 difficulty | lies in the fact that the confirmation |0 system | reads the counterparty 's |1 name | from Global Counterparty .
Since |0 divisions | of companies are not legal entities |0 they | do not have the |1 power | to contract in their own names .
"If the correct legal |0 name | is not in Global Counterparty , the |0 confirmation | goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the |1 contract | itself ."
|0 That | is the source of Tana 's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system .
My |0 suggestion | is that Global |0 Counterparty | use the same |1 name | |1 that | the |0 customer | has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my |0 understanding | is that the EnronOnline |0 team | returns inappropriate |1 Applications | to the customer until they are correctly completed .
In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their |1 application | |0 they | are understandably upset and are now complaining .
"|0 I | would appreciate it if |0 you | could get this |1 one | fixed today and , if |0 you | have any |1 problem | with changing the GCP |1 procedure | , please let |1 me | know ."

"Hello ,"
"Yes , |0 GCP | provides the |1 links | to establish the |1 correlation | between the parent and child for our downstream systems ."

To |1 Whom | |0 It | May Concern :
"Through TV and newspapers , |0 I | hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security |1 information | ."
|0 I | am very concerned about this issue .
|0 I | have the following |1 suggestion | for our company .
"Since Enron 's employees are assigned an SAP identification |1 numbers | ( P number ) and an HR number , could |0 Enron | as a company use these |1 IDs | instead of the SS numbers ?"
|0 This | will be safer for all employees .
"For example , |0 I | am concerned when |0 I | buy the monthly bus |1 passes | and |0 I | have to fill in my SS |1 number | ."
"|0 I | do not feel secure at all to see my |1 SS | in so many databases at Enron , especially when some |0 databases | are from third - parties ( out - sourcing ) ."
|0 We | could use our badge |1 number | there instead of our SS .
Please let |1 me | know how your |0 organization | can help the Enron |1 employees | feel safer about the safeguard of their SS number .
Please calendar and print for my files on this meeting .
Thanks .

Confidential Settlement Document Per CPUC Rule 51
Gas Accord II Settlement Participants :
Attached is PG&E 's Gas Accord II ( GA II ) Settlement Proposal .
|0 We | believe |0 it | addresses |1 many | of the issues and concerns |0 you | have raised in the workshops .
"As an overview , this |0 proposal | : * Maintains the basic Gas Accord |1 structure | in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *"
* Offers end user transportation |1 rates | for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today . *
* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers . *
"* Offers a 7.5 cent / dth |1 rate | to large customers while minimizing rate |1 changes | to other customers , minimizing the |1 incentive | for these |0 customers | to seek to bypass local transmission |1 charges | and other |0 CPUC | - approved charges . *"
"* Adopts |1 guidelines | to improve |1 reliability | and help moderate |1 prices | in gas commodity markets , and identifies the capital |1 projects | needed to meet these |1 guidelines | over the course of the GA II period ( 2003 - 2007 ) . *"
"* Provides a high |1 degree | of rate stability , with a 3.5 % escalator to capture both |1 inflation | and the cost of needed capital projects ."
The guaranteed |0 rates | will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events . *
"* Preserves a rate |1 differential | between the Redwood and Baja paths , although somewhat less than the current differential . *"
"* Proposes a two - stage open |1 season | for firm transportation services beginning in 2003 , with end |0 users | receiving a first |1 option | on available capacity . *"
* Maintains the core aggregation |1 program | with some adjustments .
"|0 PG&E | also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive |0 Mechanism | ( CPIM ) will be similar to today 's mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity |1 holdings | needed to meet anticipated |1 increases | in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather |1 event | ."
"|0 This | also will serve as a reminder that an all - Party meeting is scheduled at PG&E 's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11 , to discuss this |1 proposal | and to respond to your questions ."
|0 We | look forward to answering your |1 questions | and receiving your |1 feedback | .
"The attached |0 documents | include the GA II Settlement |1 proposal | , an Attachment ( a copy of PG&E 's proposed Gas Rule 27 ) , and a set of supporting workpapers ."
"Finally , please note that the Settlement |0 document | and the Attachment are in "" Word 2000 "" format ."
"|0 We | would be glad to provide the same |1 documents | in an earlier version of Word , upon request by individual Parties ."
|0 We | look forward to seeing |1 you | on January 10 - 11 .
"In the meantime , |0 we | extend our best |1 wishes | for a safe and happy holiday season ."

Jeff -
"instead of suggesting a specific rate |1 increase | - 10 or 15 % , |0 I | think |0 we | should acknowledge that a "" modest "" |0 increase | may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim ."
"In general , |0 we | should not be overly prescriptive at this point and |0 I | know |0 you | agree with that ."
"Otherwise , |0 I | think |0 you | have captured the |1 points | excellently ."
|0 We | 're in the process of developing a |1 strategy | to take |1 us | through the next few months .
"But while the ( otherwise perishable ) |0 thoughts | are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday , |0 I | wanted to throw out some |1 observations | for discussion in the days / weeks ahead ."
"OBSERVATION -- The |0 pressure | to finger |1 somebody | for "" price gouging "" is increasing ."
"The |0 administration | is hell bent on finding a "" fall |1 guy | . """
The price |0 spikes | pose real political |1 risks | for Davis and |0 he | and his folks need and want an easy |1 way | out .
"His press |0 release | following the hearing renewed the |1 call | for "" refunds . """
"On my panel , |0 Loretta | Lynch asked |2 Reliant | and Duke to supply |1 her | with the details of the contracts |0 they | cut to sell their |1 power | forward to marketers ."
And Carl Wood 's |0 remarks | were extreme .
"At the Barton hearing , a liberal |0 democrat | ( Filner ) and a conservative Republican ( Hunter ) locked |1 arms | in calling for refunds ."
"|0 Bilbray | joined the "" gouging "" band |1 wagon | ."
"The |0 utilities | repeatedly called on FERC to do a "" real "" |1 investigation | , with hearings , testimony , data discovery --- the works ."
"On the positive side , the FERC |0 commissioners | lauded |1 Wolak | , his analysis , and his remarks on the panel ."
|0 Wolak | said somewhat emphatically that the |0 nature | of California 's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single |1 participant | as the culprit .
"|0 He | also stated that just |0 everyone | 's just acting in their own self - interest , responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure ."
IMPLICATION -- It seems prudent for |0 Enron | to understand better its |1 risks | of getting fingered .
"In the best case , the |0 clamoring | for a "" refund "" subsides ."
"In which case , the only |0 cost | to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the |1 risks | of getting fingered ."
"In the medium case , |0 investigations | find that |0 Enron | ( like others ) "" played by the rules , "" but the |0 rules | stunk , and |0 Enron | profited at the expense of California consumers ."
"|0 You | 're right , Sue ."
|0 Rates | ca n't go up w/out declaring the rate |1 freeze | over in some fashion --- trying to finesse |1 it | .
Thanks very much for the comments .
|0 Harry | also had a good |1 comment | --- do n't specify the |1 amount | of rate increase in our comments ; rather note that the rate |0 increase | needs to be well - reasoned and based on facts and evidence .
Will make that |1 change | .

"The initial reservoir |0 reports | estimate |1 reserves | of 80 - 120 million barrels of sour crude and |0 they | estimate initial |1 production | to be 40,000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003 ."
Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25 - 27 API Gravity and 1.5 - 2.0 % sulfur .
|0 Plans | are to build a private |1 pipeline | to Equilon 's West Delta # 143 platform and then bring the |1 oil | onshore .
|0 Peggy | is finding out where |0 WD | # 143 pumps to onshore .
Tom 's |0 group | would like to know if |0 we | have any |1 interesting | in buying the |1 crude | on either a fixed or floating basis .
The floating could be tied to a Platt 's index or the NYMEX .
"|0 It | is far too early to expect |1 Murphy | to enter into a physical or financial contract , but |0 Tom | hopes to get |2 us | first and / or last |1 look | from Murphy when the |0 time | is right ."
"Another |0 alternative | is to give |2 Murphy | |1 barrels | at their 95,000 bpd Meraux , Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels ."
Could |0 someone | in your group please give |2 me | a notional non binding basis |1 differential | for this quality of crude for Cal 2003 ?

"following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , |0 i | do nt think it s necessary to have all the |1 documentation | of our counterparty 's authorization to enter into the agreement ."
|0 these | are short term transactions and requiring this |1 documentation | will cause |1 us | to lose |1 business | because competitive |0 alternatives | do not have such burdensome |1 requirements | .
"the primary |0 reason | |0 we | need these |1 things | is for the scenario where a |0 muni | does a derivative |1 deal | with an open - ended downside , loses |1 $ | 50 million , and then claims that |0 it | was not a valid contract ."
"in our case , |0 they | are only hedging ."
|0 we | are collecting a |1 premium | up front and their total cost is known up front .
therefore |0 they | will not attempt to make this |1 claim | .
"even if |0 they | did , our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout ."
the |0 risk | of losing |1 business | is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their |1 premium | back .
seems like a 5 second decision to me .
is it possible to combine the standard |1 isda | and our confirm into a single long form ?
by going away from the standard isda maybe |0 we | can eliminate these |1 requirements | because the payout |0 liability | is only 1 - way .

|0 What | happened ?
"Here 's a |0 story | ... as |0 I | was waiting at the bus stop ( 7:35 am ) to go to school , a |0 lady | approached |1 me | and asked if |0 I | 'd make sure her |0 daughter | got on a certain bus ."
The |0 mother | was running late for work and could not wait .
|0 I | could n't say no ... so |0 Nicki | ( the little girl - 10 yrs. old ) and I waited for the bus .
"|0 It | was now , 8:15 and there was no |0 sign | of her bus ."
"On top of things , |0 I | had |1 quiz | at 8 am ."
|1 Which | |0 I | then realized |0 I | missed .
|0 I | decided that |0 Nicki | would just have to wait on her own .
|0 I | asked |1 her | if |0 she | had any |1 relatives | |0 that | would want to know of her whereabouts .
|0 I | called her |1 grandmother | and explained |1 things | to her .
Pretty strange ... aye .
"A |0 bus | |0 that | runs through UofH arrived and |0 I | almost got on without her , but |0 I | could n't do |1 it | ."
"Finally , |0 I | told the little |1 girl | that |0 she | would have to accompany |1 me | to school ( 8:30 am ) ."
There were only 15 |0 minutes | left of class .
|0 I | stayed for the remainder of the lecture .
After class |0 we | went back to bus stop and within minutes her |0 bus | arrived .
|0 I | told the bus |1 driver | where to drop |1 her | off .
|0 I | notified her |1 grandmother | with the time of the departure .
And |0 I | was relieved when |0 Nicki | called to let |1 me | know |0 she | was home safe .
Please send the |1 memo | to the EGM business heads as well .

Marianne : |0 The | following are my comments :
"1 . In Section 1.1 , there should be a |0 parentheses | after etc. in the 5th line ."
"2 . In Section 3.1 , in the last sentence after the proviso insert "" |1 a | "" before the word "" change "" and after the word "" in "" ."
"3 . In Section 6.1 , change 20 Business |1 Days | to 20 days ."
"Also , add a |1 semicolon | at the end of clause ( i ) ."
4 . In Section 6.2.1 |0 I | 'll just note that the discount rate |0 sentence | |0 I | think is still an open issue .
"5 . In Section 6.3 , clause ( c ) should be reworded to fit with the language in the beginning of the Section ."
"6 . Capitalize the |1 word | "" facility "" in the definition of Average Annual Load Factor ."
7 . Delete the |1 definition | of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1 .
8 . Where is the defined term Govt Authority used ?
"9 . In the GTC , the ECP |0 rep | should also apply to EESI ."
"Also , in the 7th line of the reps add the |1 word | "" into "" after the word "" entered "" and before the word "" this "" ."
"10 . In Collateral Requests , insert a |1 comma | after deposit in the last line ."
|0 I | will also add granting / perfection |1 language | .
"11 . In Events of Default , |0 clause | ( a ) refers to a dispute section |0 which | |0 I | 'm not sure exists ."
"In clause ( e ) , delete the "" |1 s | "" : from the word consolidation ."
12 . Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1 .
"13 . In UCC / Disclaimer of warranties , add a |1 clause | ( c ) ."
|0 I | would add setoff |1 language | .

Carol :
|0 I | have attempted to incorporate the |1 changes | |1 that | |0 Jim | has incorporated in our long form power agreement |1 which | |0 ENA | has suggested to date into the short form .
Attached please find a sample short |1 form | ( for the Con Ed market ) for your review .
Please note |1 the | following as |0 you | review :
1 . The short |0 forms | do not contain the |1 optionality | relating to |0 our | performing billing |1 services | -- |0 all | of our midmarket forms anticipate that |0 we | will act as customer 's billing agent and that |0 we | will collect all |1 amounts | due related to T&D and the like from the customer ( and reflect |1 same | on our invoice ) and pass those |1 amounts | on to the customer 's utility .
"2 . |0 I | did not include a "" Setoff "" |1 provision | in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , |0 we | will not , nor will an |0 affiliate | , have another |1 agreement | in place with these customers ."
"If |0 you | feel strongly about |0 our | including a setoff |1 provision | , |0 we | will do so ."
3 . The |0 change | in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the |0 thinking | here is that the long form |0 language | is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and |0 we | 've had great |1 difficulty | selling |1 it | in the past ) .
"Taking into consideration this |1 class | of customer , |0 we | decided to include certain |1 items | , including our inability to cover our |1 costs | due to a change in law , rules or practices as a "" force majeure event "" in an effort to soften the |1 approach | ( see the |1 GTCs | ) ."
"Also |0 we | do not address |1 calculation | of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long |0 form | does -- again , more in the interest of "" saving |1 space | "" than anything else ..."
Let |1 us | know your |1 thoughts | on this document and if |0 you | are comfortable with |0 our | using |1 this | until such time as the hybrid form is launched .
"If |0 you | are comfortable , |0 we | will drive these |1 changes | into our other midmarket power forms ."
"Thanks again for your help with this project ,"
Marianne
"P.S. Please be sure to copy |1 Sarah | Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- |0 they | will be taking this |1 project | during my "" hiatus "" -- |0 I | am moving to PA on Friday of this week , and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16 ."
|0 I | will start up again in mid-July ...

|0 I | think |0 Valerie | Mooney ( our credit person ) and Ed Sacks are still discussing some minor fine |1 tuning | of the LOC format .
"|0 I | spoke to Bob Bruce this morning - |0 we | 're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA , and there is a minor credit / billing |0 issue | in Paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral |1 that | |0 Val | will discuss with Ed as well ."
"As far as the |0 EEI | goes , the only remaining |0 issue | |1 that | |0 I | 'm aware of ( aside from finalizing the |1 LOC | ) is whether |0 we | 've finished coordinating the |1 Attachment | containing the |1 list | of prior transactions ."
Sounds like |0 we | may actually get these |1 documents | executed early next week .

Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report .
Note :
Total |0 transportation | invoiced for 2001 was $ 180.9 m .
The |0 amount | of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $ 165.9 m .
This |0 difference | is mainly due to the following :
"$ 10.0 m - negotiated rates reserve ( Reliant , Sempra , Richardson , Astr , and BP Energy ) - $ collected"
$ 2.7 m - SoCal rate issue - $ not collected
$ 1.8 m - additional month of PGE revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $ collected
Revenues for these customers were adjusted according .
"Also , revenues for the shippers acquiring released |1 volumes | from PGE at rates above TW 's tariff rates were adjusted accordingly ."

"The in - service |0 date | of May 1 , will be very difficult to attain ."
"Since the bankruptcy filing , |0 vendors | have been very reluctant to ship |1 material | prior to it being prepaid ( Daniels , Fisher , Rosemont , other ) ."

( From time PA approved and funded to in - service will be 75 days at most .
|0 We | have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and |0 prepayment | has taken 45 |1 days | alone .

Probing the ' palace |1 coup | '
Electricity : A |0 panel | focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president .
"September 26 , 2001"
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register
SACRAMENTO
A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 |1 subpoenas | on electricity producers and officials |0 who | manage California 's energy |1 grid | to determine whether |0 they | acted in concert to manipulate energy |1 prices | .
"The investigative |0 committee | , headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn , D - Santa Ana , is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that |0 it | has earned a |1 name | around the Capitol : "" the palace |1 coup | . """
"|0 Lawmakers | and consumer groups allege that the |0 events | - directed by the man |0 who | heads the state 's energy |1 grid | - fueled the California energy |1 crisis | , pushed the |1 state | into the power - buying business and helped make |1 billions | of dollars for power producers ."
"The central |0 question | behind the palace coup is whether |0 Terry | Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , acted alone when |0 he | took |1 steps | to remove key price |1 caps | designed to limit the |1 amount | power |0 generators | could charge ."
"|0 Winter | defied his own |1 board | and Gov. Gray Davis when |0 he | filed a 50 - page |1 request | to remove the |1 caps | , |0 records | and interviews show ."
""" |0 I | do n't know how these |0 events | could have taken |1 place | without some concerted effort , "" said |0 Dunn | ."
"The |0 subpoenas | will force |1 those | involved , including Winter , to provide sworn |1 testimony | about the events to the committee , and to turn over |1 e-mails | , personal calendars and memos ."
"Davis spokesman |0 Steve | Maviglio said the |0 governor | felt "" betrayed "" by the actions of Winter ."
""" The |0 governor | believes |0 it | was the defining moment , when |0 what | was a mounting |0 problem | turned into an instant crisis , "" |0 Maviglio | said ."
"|0 Winter | refused |1 comment | , referring all |1 questions | to the public relations office ."
ISO spokesman |0 Gregg | Fishman said Dunn 's |0 committee | will find no criminal |1 conduct | .
The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind : to keep the |1 lights | on .
"At the time , |0 generators | were refusing to sell |1 power | in California because of the price caps ."
""" |0 It | was an emergency , "" |0 Fishman | said ."
""" |0 We | had to take |1 action | . ''"
|0 What | became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board |0 members | voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity |0 producers | could charge for power .
The |0 restrictions | would drive |2 prices | as |1 low | as $ 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $ 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier .
""" |0 They | ( electricity generators ) grinned and beared the $ 750 price |1 cap | , but this new |0 plan | by ISO was too much , "" said |0 Dunn | , whose |0 committee | has been investigating since March ."
""" All |0 hell | broke loose . ''"
"|0 Records | show that on Oct. 31 , power |0 generators | and electricity traders filed |1 letters | with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , demanding that the new plan be killed ."
"The letters , six in all , were sent within two hours of each other and represented |1 dozens | of power generators ."
""" If not removed immediately , the ( ISO ) price |0 cap | will sow |1 confusion | in the market , threaten |1 reliability | and stifle new |1 investment | in generating capacity , '' read one |0 letter | written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III ."
"Although there is |0 nothing | illegal about the |0 generators | acting together to lobby against price caps , |0 Dunn | believes the |0 letters | and other actions around the same time showed clear |1 coordination | among energy officials ."
"|0 He | said the main |0 aim | of the subpoenas will be to determine whether |0 collusion | occurred to "" fix "" |1 prices | , |0 which | would violate federal trade |1 laws | ."
"In the Oct. 31 letters , electricity |0 producers | told federal |1 officials | that if price caps were n't removed |0 it | would lead to a collapse of the energy market ."
The |0 generators | got their |1 way | .
"The next day , the federal |0 commission | killed the new pricing |1 plan | ."
What was left in place was a $ 250 price cap established five months earlier .
"Power |0 producers | then turned their |1 attention | toward killing that |1 cap | , saying |0 they | could n't make a |1 profit | even under these constraints ."
"|0 They | began to withhold |1 power | from California , and on Dec. 7 the |0 ISO | declared its first Stage 3 |1 emergency | and braced for blackouts , which were narrowly averted ."
|0 What | followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis .
"Winter , |0 who | in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency |1 request | , asking federal |1 officials | to abolish the $ 250 price |1 cap | ."
Final |0 authority | over lifting the |1 cap | rested with the federal government .
"Neither the ISO |0 board | , |0 which | had established the price |1 cap | , nor the governor learned of Winter 's actions until the cap had been removed ."
"In fact , the |0 attorney | |0 who | helped draft the emergency |1 request | , Charles Robinson , was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made ."
|0 He | did n't mention |1 anything | about it .
""" In retrospect , |0 we | should have told |1 them | , '' |0 Robinson | said ."
"With the price |0 caps | gone , the |0 generators | filed |1 paperwork | with federal regulators justifying higher |1 costs | ."
""" The ISO |0 staff | sat in a meeting with the governor 's key energy advisers with poker faces , not saying a |1 word | about something |0 that | was going on at the exact same moment , '' |0 Maviglio | said ."
""" It was beyond belief that |0 they | failed to mention |1 something | so significant ."
"This |0 action | accelerated the utilities ' |1 move | toward bankruptcy and forced the |1 governor | to move the |1 state | into the power - buying business . """
"|0 Prices | for electricity jumped from an average of $ 249 a megawatt to $ 700 a megawatt within three days , ISO |0 records | show ."
|0 Dunn | believes the resulting |0 overcharges | for electricity exceeded |1 $ | 30 billion .
|0 Robinson | said the |0 filing | - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt |1 Californians | .
"|0 Prices | , |0 he | said , did not spike as a result ."
Instead |0 they | followed the skyrocketing |1 price | of natural gas - which is used to run power |1 plants | to generate |1 electricity | .
|0 Robinson | said the emergency |0 order | allowed the |1 ISO | to secure |1 refunds | should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials .
""" |0 We | believe the |0 action | |0 we | took addressed a severe |1 concern | , '' |0 Robinson | said ."
""" In our view , |0 we | did not believe |0 we | changed or made worse the financial |1 situation | ."
"|0 We | felt |0 we | made |1 it | better because |0 it | introduced a |1 process | for review and refund . """
"|0 Jan | Smutney - Jones , |0 who | was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group |0 that | represents power |1 generators | , said |0 Winter | did not consult |1 him | about eliminating the price |1 cap | ."
|0 Smutney | - Jones also said |0 he | was unaware of anyone in the power - generating community being consulted .
""" |0 Terry | did |1 this | by himself , '' said |0 Smutney | - Jones , executive director of the Independent Energy Producers ."
""" |0 He | did |1 what | |0 he | thought had to be done at the time to keep the |1 power | flowing . """
The ISO |0 board | called an emergency |1 meeting | the next week demanding |0 Winter | explain his |1 actions | .
"Some board |0 members | pushed to have |0 Winter | removed , but there were |0 concerns | such |0 action | would lead to more chaos , the governor 's spokesman |0 Maviglio | said ."
"|0 James | J. Hoecker , the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman , defended making the December decision and also defended Winter ."
""" |0 They | filed an emergency |1 motion | , and |0 we | were not about to let |1 California | go dark , '' |0 Hoecker | said ."
""" |0 They | ( ISO management ) did |1 what | any independent system |0 operator | would do . """
|0 What | Dunn 's |0 committee | hopes to learn is why all these |0 events | transpired .
|0 He | believes |0 memos | and e-mails around the time of Winter 's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital |1 clues | .
""" |0 We | do n't know why |0 he | did |1 what | |0 he | did , but |0 we | are eager to find out , "" |0 Dunn | said ."
""" |0 Terry | said |0 he | made that |1 filing | in the interest of Californians , but |0 I | find that |0 argument | has no |1 basis | in fact . ''"
|0 We | should resurrect Mike Smith 's |1 note | and get |1 him | on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the |1 wheel | on this one .
|0 I | can dig |1 it | up if |0 you | 'd like .

|0 It | looks like |0 NASA | is ready to sour again after it's devastating loss from the Columbia accident |0 which | occurred nearly two years ago .
"Now , NASA |0 engineers | and astronauts are almost giddy with "" go "" fever as the tentative |0 date | for the first launch since the Columbia disaster approaches ."
"The most important |0 question | is n't whether |0 Discovery | is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures , but whether the |0 agency | itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to Challenger and Columbia , errors |0 that | grew out of a management culture |0 that | discouraged |1 criticism | and sacrificed |1 safety | for image - puffing and budget - cutting ."
|0 I | hope so .
"Seeing another "" Columbia "" |1 incident | can be quite frightening ( |0 I | woke up to it early in the morning when |0 I | was in Texas ) ."
|0 We | do n't need another |1 incident | as exploring the |1 cosmos | is something |0 that | keeps our |0 imagination | going as a species .
"Maybe one day |0 they | will allow space |1 tourism | , ( hopefully |0 that | will be in the near future ) although |0 I | would recommend that |0 NASA | build new |1 shuttles | instead of trying to preserve the older |1 ones | ."
"|0 You | do have to give |2 NASA | |1 credit | on some things as |0 they | have eliminated the "" fear of reporting |1 failure | "" |1 culture | |0 that | probably led to the lack of reporting |1 defects | on the Columbia shuttle ."
Instead |0 they | are encouraging |1 everyone | to come forward if |0 they | see any potential |1 problems | ( as it is clear that overlooked |0 problems | could result in unnecessary losses ) .
But |0 supporters | are pointing a few good |1 things | out :
"Clearly , the |0 agency | has worked hard at tackling the technical |1 challenges | posed by a superb and surprisingly independent - minded investigative panel ."
"A few weeks ago , shuttle |0 workers | at the Kennedy Space Center received a rocket - like |1 boost | in morale with two important deliveries for the next |0 shuttle | to carry ."
|0 One | is a special tool to detect |1 damage | to the thermal - protective tile while in orbit - something the Columbia |0 crew | would have welcomed .
"The |0 other | is a new fuel tank "" guaranteed "" by NASA not to shed potentially fatal |1 hunks | of insulation ."
|0 NASA | has some PR |1 hurdles | to overcome in the future .
But let |1 s | hope for their sake ( and the sake of all space lovers out there ) that |0 they | can redefine their |1 image | and rekindle the |1 hope | of space colonization again .

Healing the Collective |1 Body |
"In George Orwell 's influential novel "" 1984 "" |0 doublethink | is a device promoted by the totalitarian state government to make |0 people | accept two irreconcilable |1 ideas | at the same time such as "" |0 war | is peace "" ."
|0 I | see the |1 merit | in flowing with duality .
"|0 One | of my most cherished dualities is the understanding that |0 we | are both autonomous individuals with the power to shape our personal |1 destinies | and at the same time |0 we | are all one , that there is no |0 separation | between you and I , |0 we | are all together in this thing called life , we human beings , the birds and the tress , the rocks and the sky , all of it ."
"|0 I | have written a |1 lot | recently about healing the |1 self | so today here are a few |0 words | on healing our collective |1 body | , mind and soul ."
"Think of all life , if |0 you | will , as one great choir or one grand congregation ."
Our |0 strength | is in our unity and harmony .
Any major dischord and |0 we | all suffer .
Any |0 insult | to the collective good brings |1 us | all down .
"Living out of synch with nature is the great disease , from that flows all the |0 tributaries | |0 we | have come to think of as sickness ."
"|0 We | are only as strong as our weakest , |0 we | are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us - playing |1 sports | and being in the army taught |2 me | that |1 lesson | before |0 I | was finished being a teenager ."
When the |0 healthy | treat the |1 sick | with scorn and intolerance |0 it | brings |1 us | all down .
"When |0 those | lucky enough not to have |1 Herpes | create a |1 climate | of shame and indignity for those of us |0 who | do , not only are |0 they | hurting |1 us | , but |0 they | are hurting |1 themselves | ."
There is no |0 escape | from the collective ocean |0 we | all swim in .
|0 What | |0 you | project will always come back to either reward or haunt |1 you | .
"|0 We | are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the environment , our rejection of the natural for the industrial , and our embrace of violence over peace ."
|0 Jesus | said that |1 what | |0 you | do the |1 least | of the people |0 you | do to him .
|1 What | are |0 you | doing to the least of the people ?
"If |0 we | are all in this thing together , let |1 's | play nice ."
"Remember that |1 what | |0 you | do to yourself affects |1 me | and everybody else , remember that |1 what | |0 you | do to me and anyone else shapes your |1 destiny | ."
"No matter what progress |0 we | make as individuals in becoming healthier , |0 we | will never achieve real |1 health | until |0 we | collectively decide to create a healthier |1 reality | ."
Fortunately |0 circumstances | will force our |1 hand | soon since our collective bad |0 behaviour | can not continue indefinitely .
In the near future collective |0 choices | will need to be made .
Will |0 we | choose to live in harmony with this planet or crash and burn in a conflagration of arrogance and disregard ?
Will |0 we | choose to rise about prejudice and intolerance or go down kicking and screaming with holding on to fear and anger ?
There is no |0 health | without peace and no peace without health .

|0 Quebecker | wins U.S. bravery |1 award |
Pittsburgh -
A Quebec man was awarded a Carnegie |1 Medal | for bravery on Monday for saving two |1 friends | by fighting off a polar |1 bear | with a pocket knife two years ago on Baffin Island
"|0 Dr. | Eric Fortier , 34 , of Gatineau , Que. , used a pocket |1 knife | to attack a polar |1 bear | on Baffin Island , just south of the Arctic Circle , to save two |1 friends | who were being mauled ."
""" |0 All | of the research and all of the preparation |0 I | did leading up to the trip gave no |1 indication | that there were |0 bears | in the Soper [ River ] valley where |0 we | were canoeing , "" |0 Dr. | Fortier said ."
"|0 Dr. | Fortier , an orthodontist , learned there was at least one polar |0 bear | in the central region of Baffin Island in July 2001 when |0 he | felt |1 what | |0 he | thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall ."
""" My first |0 thought | was to push |1 it | away , "" |0 he | said ."
""" A few seconds later my |0 girlfriend | saw the |1 shadow | of a bear 's paw through the tent fly and then |0 it | started ripping through the ceiling . """
The polar |0 bear | is more dangerous than most other bears .
"The |0 latter | usually consider human |1 beings | a threat but the polar |0 bear | considers |1 humans | a snack , |0 experts | said ."
The |0 two | screamed to frighten the |1 bear | and warn their |1 friends | in a tent several metres away but the |0 bear | ripped into that tent and began mauling 31 - year - old |1 Alain | Parenteau .
""" Their |0 screams | changed , "" |0 Dr. | Fortier said ."
""" |0 I | grabbed my |1 glasses | and my knife and unzipped my |1 tent | and headed out . """
"The |0 bear | dwarfed the 6 - foot - 1 |1 Mr. | Parenteau , knocking |1 him | to the ground , |0 he | said ."
"|0 Dr. | Fortier threw a large |1 rock | at the bear , distracting |1 it | and allowing |1 Parenteau | to escape but |0 it | then turned on 25 - year - old Patricia Doyon , |0 who | was in the same tent ."
Again |0 Dr. | Fortier threw |1 rocks | at the bear and again its |0 target | was able to escape .
""" The |0 bear | gave |1 chase | and |0 I | gave |1 chase | , "" |0 he | said ."
""" At some point , |0 Patricia | tripped or the |0 bear | tripped |1 her | and was at her back ."
"|0 I | was beside the bear 's head and |0 I | stabbed |1 it | with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times . """
The |0 bear | ran off .
"While there was some |0 fur | and blood on the nine - centimetre blade , |0 Dr. | Fortier said |0 he | does n't think |0 he | hurt the |1 bear | badly ."
"Both |0 Mr. | Parenteau and Ms. Doyon , however , were bleeding badly ."
|0 Dr. | Fortier and his girlfriend lashed two |1 canoes | together and paddled eight kilometres along the Soper River .
|0 Dr. | Fortier travelled another three kilometres by foot to seek |1 help | in the nearest settlement .
"Both Mr. Parenteau and Ms. Doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived , though |0 Mr. | Parenteau had a |1 gash | within a centimetre of his jugular , |0 Dr. | Fortier said ."
|0 Dr. | Fortier was one of 15 people to receive the Carnegie |1 Medal | on Monday .
"The bronze medal is given to people |0 who | "" risk their |1 lives | to an extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the |1 lives | of others . """
"The other Canadian |0 recipient | of the medal was Ronald Joseph Crawford , 42 , of Hamilton , who was killed Aug. 4 , 2002 , while trying to defend a Hamilton sandwich shop |1 owner | from a robber wielding a |1 knife | ."
|0 Mr. | Crawford threw several |1 punches | at the assailant before he was stabbed in the heart .
U.S. industrialist |0 Andrew | Carnegie started a hero |1 fund | in 1904 after being inspired by rescue stories from a mine disaster |0 that | killed 181 |1 people | .
"The |0 award | comes with a $ 3,500 ( U.S. ) grant ."

"Hi all ,"
"There are already several |0 forums | around the net focused on discussing Guild |1 Wars | , so why create a new |1 one | ?"
|0 I | say why not ?
The main |0 reason | is |0 Google | is more accessible to the global community and |0 you | can rest assured that |0 it | 's not going to go away .
|0 I | have seen great fan |0 sites | suddenly disappear without notice and for no reason .
Usually |0 this | happens because the |0 developer | of the site can no longer afford the |1 cost | of bandwidth being used .
"|0 That | said , the maintenance of this forum is handled by Google and thus will remain reliable and |0 it | will ultimately give |2 us | more |1 time | to play :) ."
|0 I | 'm nothing more than a devoted fan of the game myself and |0 I | hope that this |0 area | can become a haven for deep fan discussions .
"Regards ,"

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL URGENT ASSISTANCE - FROM USA
FROM : GEORGE WALKER BUSH 202.456.1414 / 202.456.1111 FAX : 202.456.2461
"Dear Sir / Madam ,"
"|0 I | am GEORGE WALKER BUSH , son of the former president of the United States of America George Herbert Walker Bush , and currently serving as President of the United States of America ."
This |0 letter | might surprise |1 you | because |0 we | have not met neither in person nor by correspondence .
"|0 I | came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business |1 transaction | , |0 which | involves the |1 transfer | of a huge sum of money to an account requiring maximum |1 confidence | ."
|0 I | am writing |1 you | in absolute confidence primarily to seek your |1 assistance | in acquiring oil |1 funds | that are presently trapped in the republic of Iraq .
"My |0 partners | and I solicit your |1 assistance | in completing a |1 transaction | begun by my father , who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the United States of America , and bravely served his |1 country | as director of the United States Central Intelligence Agency ."
"In the decade of the nineteen - eighties , my |0 father | , then vice - president of the United States of America , sought to work with the good offices of the President of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue |1 sources | in the neighboring Islamic republic of Iran ."
"This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a falling - out with his Iraqi partner , |0 who | sought to acquire additional oil revenue |1 sources | in the neighboring emirate of Kuwait , a wholly - owned U.S. - British subsidiary ."
"My |0 father | re-secured the petroleum |1 assets | of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of sixty - one billion U.S. dollars ( $ 61,000,000,000 ) ."
"Out of that cost , thirty - six billion dollars ( $ 36,000,000,000 ) were supplied by King Hussein , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchies , and sixteen billion dollars ( $ 16,000,000,000 ) supplied by German and Japanese partners ."
But my father 's former Iraqi business |0 partner | remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves .
"My |0 family | is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the |1 removal | of the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum |1 assets | of his country , as compensation for the costs of removing |1 him | from power ."
"Unfortunately , our |0 partners | from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the |1 burden | of this new venture , |0 which | in its upcoming phase may cost the |1 sum | of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars ( $ 100,000,000,000 - $ 200,000,000,000 ) , both in the initial acquisition and in long - term management ."
"Without the funds from our 1991 partners , |0 we | would not be able to acquire the oil |1 revenue | trapped within Iraq ."
|0 That | is why my |0 family | and our colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious |1 assistance | .
"Our distinguished |0 colleagues | in this business transaction include the sitting |1 vice-president | of the United States of America , Richard Cheney , |0 who | is an original partner in the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton oil company , and Condoleeza Rice , whose professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her ."
|0 I | would beseech |1 you | to transfer a |1 sum | equaling ten to twenty - five |1 percent | ( 10 - 25 % ) of your yearly income to our account to aid in this important venture .
The Internal Revenue |0 Service | of the United States of America will function as our trusted intermediary .
|0 I | propose that |0 you | make this |1 transfer | before the fifteenth ( 15th ) of the month of April .
|0 I | know that a |0 transaction | of this magnitude would make |1 anyone | apprehensive and worried .
But |0 I | am assuring |1 you | that |0 all | will be well at the end of the day .
"A bold step taken shall not be regretted , |0 I | assure |1 you | ."
Please do be informed that this business |0 transaction | is 100 % legal .
"If |0 you | do not wish to co-operate in this transaction , please contact our intermediary |1 representatives | to further discuss the |1 matter | ."
|0 I | pray that |0 you | understand our |1 plight | .
My |0 family | and our colleagues will be forever grateful .
Please reply in strict confidence to the contact numbers below .

"|0 You | can get |1 details | about NASA spending here , from their own webpage ."

"Let |1 me | put |1 it | this way - If |0 you | have watched |1 TV | recently , crossed a modern |1 bridge | , flown in an airplane , recieved any |1 form | of modern medicine , did any |1 mathematics | , drove a |1 car | , used a cellular |1 phone | , etc. then |0 you | have somehow directly reaped the |1 rewards | |1 which | |0 NASA | has returned to us ."

( Filed : 19/11/2004 )
China 's insatiable |0 demand | for energy is prompting |1 fears | of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as |0 it | seeks reliable |1 supplies | of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan .
An |0 intrusion | into Japanese territorial waters by a Chinese nuclear submarine last week and a trade deal with Brazil are the latest apparently unconnected consequences of China 's soaring economic growth .
Increased car |0 usage | in China is creating a high |1 demand | for petrol
"The |0 connection | , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil |1 supplies | abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan ."
"The submarine incident was put down to a "" technical error "" by the Chinese government , |0 which | apologised to Japan ."
"But even before the incident the People 's |0 Daily | , the government mouthpiece , had commented that |0 competition | over the East China Sea between the two countries was "" only a prelude of the game between China and Japan in the arena of international energy "" ."
The Brazil trade |0 deal | included |1 funding | for a joint oil - drilling and pipeline programme at a cost |0 that | |0 experts | said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying |1 oil | on the market .
"The |0 West | , however , has paid little |1 attention | to these developments ."
"For the United |0 States | and Europe are far more concerned with the even more sensitive issues of China 's relations with "" pariah states "" ."
"In September , |0 China | threatened to veto any |1 move | to impose |1 sanctions | on Sudan over the atrocities in Darfur ."
"|0 It | has invested |1 $ | 3 billion in the African country 's oil industry , |0 which | supplies |1 it | with seven per cent of its needs ."
"Then , this month , |0 it | said that |0 it | opposed |1 moves | to refer Iran 's nuclear stand - |1 off | with the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council ."
"A week before , China 's second biggest state oil |0 firm | had signed a $ 70 billion |1 deal | for oilfield and natural gas development with Iran , |0 which | already supplies 13 per |1 cent | of China 's needs ."
|0 China | has its own |1 reserves | of oil and natural gas and once was a net oil exporter .
"But as its |0 economy | has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades , so has its |0 demand | for energy ."
"This year |0 it | overtook |1 Japan | as the world 's second largest consumer of energy , behind the US ."
"Its projected |0 demand | , boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find |1 alternatives | to polluting coal for electricity generation , has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year ."
|0 Shortages | are already leading to power cuts in the big cities .
"Since |0 President | Hu ordered state - owned oil |1 firms | to "" go abroad "" to ensure |1 supply | , |0 they | have begun drilling for gas in the East China Sea , just west of the line |1 that | |0 Japan | regards as its border ."
"|0 Japan | protested , to no avail , that the |0 project | should be a joint one ."
The |0 two | are also set to clash over Russia 's oil wealth .
|0 China | is furious that |0 Japan | has outbid |1 it | in their battle to determine the |1 route | of the pipeline |1 that | |0 Russia | intends to build to the Far East .
"|0 Japan | favoured a |1 route | to the sea , enabling |1 oil | to be shipped to both Japan and China ."
"|0 China | wanted an overland |1 route | through its own territory , |0 which | would give |2 it | ultimate |1 control | if |0 hostilities | broke out ."
"Increasingly , |0 analysts | are saying that China 's |0 efforts | have gone beyond |0 what | is safe or even in its own interests ."
"|0 Claude | Mandil , the executive director of the International Energy Agency in Paris , said the |0 reserves | in the East China Sea were hardly worth the |1 trouble | ."
""" |0 Nobody | thinks that there will be a |0 lot | of oil and gas in this part of the world , "" |0 he | said ."
""" |0 It | may be a difficult political issue but |0 I | do n't think the energy |0 content | is worthwhile . """
"Eurasia |0 Group | , a New York - based firm of political analysts , said its oil |0 experts | worked out that |0 China | was paying such an inflated |1 price | for its investment in Brazil that the |0 cost | for the oil |0 it | ended up with was three times the market price ."
""" If China 's |0 economy | falters , |0 which | , in my view , appears increasingly likely , then commodity |0 prices | will plummet , and with them , the value of the assets |0 that | produce |1 them | , "" |0 Jason | Kindopp , Eurasia 's lead China analyst , said ."
""" |0 Beijing | may end up in a early 1990s Japan situation , where it is forced to sell recently purchased overseas |1 assets | for a fraction of what |0 it | paid for them . """
China 's wider |0 aggression | to secure |1 oil | and gas was the greatest threat to its international standing in the next decade .
""" |0 Sudan | is the primary example , "" |0 he | said ."
""" |0 It | marks the first |1 time | in recent years that |0 China | has promised to wield its veto |1 power | in the UN Security Council against a petition initiated by the United States and backed by France and Great Britain . """

Visualizations as a helpful beginning technique
-----------------------------------------------
"If |0 you | consider that |0 you | still need the |1 assistance | of other visualizations to help the |0 mind | feel the |1 spirit | of transcendence , try the |1 following | before moving onto the more formal method below ."
"|0 Visualisations | can be as useful tools , but |0 meditation | is more than that ."
|0 Meditation | has to do with what is called ideation .
It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file |0 that | follows after the visualisations .
Find a comfortable |1 place | on the floor and sit with your legs crossed .
"Place your |1 hands | one on top of the other in your lap , keep your |1 back | straight , keep eyes closed and keep tongue on the roof of your mouth ."
"Your |0 breathing | should be calm and relaxed , through the nose ."
"Spend a |1 minute | or so concentrating on your breath , feeling the |1 air | flowing through your nostrils ."
1 . Warm Sun Visualization
Continue to breathe slowly and deeply .
"With each breath , feel the |0 muscles | in your body becoming lighter and lighter , and also your external motor and sensory |0 organs | are feeling like |0 they | are withdrawing from the world into a special inner quietness ."
Imagine the |1 tension | melting away as |0 you | continue breathing rhythmically and naturally .
"Picture |1 yourself | sitting on a warm , tropical beach basking in the glow of the sun ... ."
"Visualize the vivid , beautiful |1 colours | of the earth ( its flowers and plants ) , the sea next to you , and the sky above you ."
Feel |1 yourself | floating above the earth and sea .
"As |0 you | sit above the world , the |0 warmth | of the golden sun penetrates your |1 body | and makes |0 you | feel warmer and warmer ."
|0 It | surrounds |1 you | .
The golden |0 rays | feel soft and soothing .
Now |0 you | are far above the earth - into space .
|0 Everything | around you is so vast .
"Yet , there is |0 warmth | and a familiarity with the vastness ."
|0 You | want to merge your |1 mind | with the greater universal Mind |0 that | surrounds |1 you | .
Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your |0 mind | to merge with the that universal Consciousness .
"And while doing so continue using the Baba Nam Kevalam |1 mantra | ( breathe in with Baba Nam , breathe out with Kevalam ) ."
Try |1 this | for 5 to 10 minutes .
Now come back to earth again - slowly .
Imagine |1 yourself | sitting on the beach serenely and restfully .
Your |0 muscles | are loose and limp .
Feel your |1 body | sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly |1 connection | again .
"The sun 's |0 rays | and warmth are still with you , surrounding |1 you | ."
|0 You | are in a state of peace and relaxation .
"With each breath , watch your |1 body | and ensure that |0 it | remains relaxed - at peace ."
"Continue to feel the |1 warmth | of the sunlight all over your body , warming |1 you | deeply and gently ."
|0 You | want to bring |1 something | back with you from your deep space experience where |0 you | sensed your |1 mind | merging with the universal Mind .
|0 This | will be the warmth of the sun - a close reminder and link between earth and the infinite space .
"Visualize the |1 inside | of your body bathed in the golden light , absorbing every |1 ray | and glowing as radiantly as the sun ."
"A warm , gentle |0 breeze | swirls around your body and relaxes |1 you | even more ."
Let your |1 mind | and body be totally at peace .
"Now feel |1 yourself | returning to where |0 you | sit ... move your |1 hands | and feet a little , stretch |1 them | ."
Open your |1 eyes | .
2 . Mountain Visualization
Another thing |0 you | can try .
"Imagine |0 you | 're sitting on top of a mountain , and that |0 it | 's the most peaceful place |0 you | can think of ."
"Feel that |0 you | 're sitting there in complete peace , right on top of the world ."
Now imagine that infinite |0 happiness | is surrounding |1 you | in every direction .
Feel you 're completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness .
Now start to repeat within your mind the |1 mantra | : BABA NAM KEVALAM .
"Its |0 meaning | is "" Infinite |0 happiness | is everywhere "" ."
"Feel the |1 meaning | , do n't just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( BABA NAM KEVALAM ) to an English meaning ( Infinite peace and happiness ) ."
"Think internally , intuitively , not by words , of the meaning , as |0 you | 're repeating |1 it | ."
This is called ideation .
"It is important to take the |1 idea | , not just the intellectual analysis ."
Touching deep into the idea is what builds |1 intuition | - |0 it | is a synthetic process .
"Whereas , trying to translate and grapple with wordy |1 meanings | is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process ."
"Feel you 're surrounded by infinite peace and happiness , and feel that your own |0 sense | of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you ."
"|0 You | can go further and feel that your unit |0 consciousness | , a dot in the Infinite Consciousness , is merging with Infinity ."
"Continue for as long as |0 you | like , then open your |1 eyes | ."
OK |0 that | is fairly basic :) .
The important |0 point | is to develop some psycho-spiritual |1 connection | between your mind and the universal Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness .
Do n't worry if |0 you | have |1 trouble | concentrating on the mantra and ideation - |0 that | 's normal .
It takes some |1 time | and practice to be able to focus on the one thought .
The main |0 thing | is to keep practicing .
"If |0 you | do n't practice , then |0 nothing | happens ."
"Well maybe a |0 miracle | could happen , but let |1 s | face |1 it | |0 we | 're ordinary people and so require practical day to day |1 techniques | !"

NORTH CAROLINA RELIGIOUS COALITION FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY
"From what |0 we | hear from the news media , |0 one | could easily conclude that all |0 Christians | are opposed to gay marriage ."
But |0 that | ’s not the case .
Last year an organization named the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality was formed to get out the |1 message | that at least some |0 people | of faith are not opposed to extending the |1 rights | and responsibilities of civil marriage to same - gender couples .
"|0 One | of “ NCRC4ME ’s ” major efforts is to collect |1 signatures | for the attached “ Declaration of Religious Leaders , ” which has been and will again be presented to members of the NC legislature ."
"|0 It | presents the |1 case | for marriage equality and states , “ We are resolved that the |0 State | should not interfere with same - gender couples |0 who | choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage . ”"
"A measure to amend the NC |1 Constitution | to ban gay |1 marriage | was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session , so there is a real |0 need | for visible support for the “ pro-same - gender - marriage ” side of this issue ."
At its February meeting the CHS |0 Vestry | voted unanimously to add their |1 names | to the Declaration .
Our |0 Rector | Barbara and our Deacon Clare also have signed the |1 Declaration | .
"Furthermore , the |0 Vestry | voted unanimously to invite the |1 support | of members of the CHS congregation for the Declaration ."
"( Since the Declaration is written as coming from “ religious leaders , ” |0 people | |0 who | do n’t consider |1 themselves | “ religious leaders ” can sign as “ Supporters of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality . ” )"
Please note that the |0 Declaration | addresses only civil |1 marriage | ; |0 it | says |1 nothing | about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage .
"If |0 you | have any |1 questions | please feel free to call |1 me | ( after Sat. the 26th , when |0 I | will return from a trip ) ."
"Sign - up |0 lists | will be available at the services on Feb. 27 and March 6 , or |0 you | can email |1 me | ."
|0 I | will email |1 names | and email addresses ( or postal addresses ) of signers to NCRC4ME in time for their “ lobby day ” in Raleigh on March 15 .
Thank |1 you | for your consideration of this issue .

"North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality Declaration of Religious Leaders April 19 , 2004"
"The most fundamental human |0 right | , after the necessities of food , clothing and shelter , is the right to affection and the supportive love of other human beings ."
|0 We | become most fully human when |0 we | love another |1 person | .
|0 We | can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit .
"This |0 right | to love and form a |1 family | is so fundamental that our United States |0 Constitution | takes |1 it | for granted in its dedication to "" secure the |1 blessings | of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . ”"
"The North Carolina |0 Constitution | likewise affirms the “ inalienable |1 rights | ” of human beings to "" life , liberty , the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor , and the pursuit of happiness . """
"Throughout history , |0 tyrants | have known that by denying the |1 right | of oppressed peoples to form and nurture |1 families | , |0 they | can kill the |1 spirit | of those peoples ."
"> From the shameful history of slavery in America , the |0 injustice | of forbidding |1 people | to marry is evident as a denial of a basic human right ."
"The American |0 laws | forbidding interracial |1 marriage | , now struck down , were clearly discriminatory ."
|0 Denial | of the status of marriage to those |0 who | would freely accept its |1 responsibilities | creates legal and economic |1 inequities | and social injustice .
|0 We | feel called to protest and oppose this |1 injustice | .
"As religious people , clergy and lay leaders , we are mandated by faith to stand for justice in our common civic life ."
|0 We | oppose the |1 use | of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal |1 equity | to same - gender couples .
As concerned citizens |0 we | affirm the |1 liberty | of adults of the same gender to love and marry .
"|0 We | insist that no one , especially the state , is allowed to coerce |1 people | into marriage or bar two consenting |1 adults | , whether of the same or differing genders , from forming the family |1 unit | |0 that | lets |1 them | be more fully loving , thus more fully human ."
"|0 We | respect the |1 fact | that |0 debate | and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural , theological and liturgical issues involved ."
"However , |0 we | draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction ."
"We are resolved that the |0 State | should not interfere with same - gender couples |0 who | choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage ."
|0 We | affirm |1 freedom | of conscience in this matter .
"|0 We | recognize that the |0 state | may not require religious |1 groups | to officiate at , or bless , same - gender marriages ."
"Likewise , a |0 denial | of state civil recognition dishonors the religious |1 convictions | of those communities and clergy |0 who | officiate at , and bless , same - gender marriages ."
The |0 state | may not favor the |1 convictions | of one religious group over another by denying |2 individuals | their fundamental |1 right | to marry and to have those |0 marriages | recognized by civil law .
"As faith leaders , |0 we | commit |1 ourselves | to public action , visibility , education , and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry ."

The One Reason Why All |0 Americans | Should Oppose The |1 Nomination | Of Samuel Alito
"|0 He | Would Tear Down Our |1 System | Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much |1 Power | To The President"
My Fellow Americans :
"As |0 many | of you may have heard , |0 President | Bush has nominated a long - time Federal |1 Judge | named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court , to fill a |1 vacancy | created by the retirement of another member of the Court ."
"Under our Constitution , this |0 nomination | can not take |1 effect | unless and until the United States |0 Senate | gives its |1 Consent | , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 ."
"A copy of the Constitution , with links back to the official source , is located at http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt"
Judge |0 Samuel | Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate |1 candidates | for this position :
|0 He | has a very high |1 intellect | .
"|0 He | graduated very high in his class , from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale ."
"|0 He | has a long and distinguished |1 record | , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court ."
"|0 He | has encyclopedic |1 knowledge | of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases , and |0 he | can recite |1 details | from memory ."
"|0 He | demonstrates an excellent "" Judicial |1 Temperament | , "" being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail ."
His |0 co-workers | love |1 him | .
His fellow |0 judges | love |1 him | .
His |0 family | loves |1 him | .
|0 President | Bush loves |1 him | .
"Yes , |0 it | is true that some |0 people | do n't like the |1 way | |0 they | think |0 he | will vote on the Supreme Court ."
"But other |0 people | do like the |1 way | |0 they | think |0 he | will vote , and the |0 ones | |0 who | favor |1 him | seem to outnumber the |1 ones | |0 who | oppose |1 him | ."
"So now the |0 Senate | is getting ready to vote soon , on whether to approve |1 him | or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan. 27 , 2006 ) |0 it | looks like |0 he | has |1 more | than the fifty - one votes needed for approval ."
"The |0 President | is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this |1 vote | , because |0 he | very much wants to have |1 Samuel | Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the |1 cases | |0 Bush | is interested in ."
So there is a |0 lot | of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt |1 vote | of approval .
"There is an old |0 saying | |0 that | applies in this situation : "" Act in haste , repent at leisure . """
"Sometimes |0 you | can make a bad |1 decision | very quickly , then regret |1 it | for many years to come ."
"|0 That | is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because |0 he | has one tragic |1 flaw | - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - |0 which | makes |1 him | completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : |0 He | does not really agree with the system of "" Checks and Balances "" built into the Constitution , and |0 he | is ready to start tearing |1 it | down in order to follow the "" Unitary Executive |1 Theory | , "" |0 which | calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court ."
And because of this tragic flaw . . .
""" |0 He | Would Tear Down Our |1 System | Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much |1 Power | To The President . """
"In our Constitutional system , |0 we | have three |1 branches | of the Federal Government : the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial branches ."
"And the basic |0 idea | behind the Checks and Balances |0 we | have is that if one |0 branch | of the Government goes crazy , the other |0 two | can hold |1 it | down ."
"But |0 Samuel | Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the "" Unitary Executive Theory "" - |0 which | says that the |0 President | should have complete |1 control | over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive |0 Branch | should be in charge of almost everything |1 that | the |0 Government | actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , |0 which | exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President ."
The |0 Military | is not part of the Executive Branch : |0 it | is a separate entity .
""" |0 Commander | In Chief "" does n't mean that |0 he | is the boss of the Military , merely mean that |0 he | is the Administrator , just as |0 he | is the Administrator of the Executive Branch , charged with "" executing faithfully "" all the |1 laws | passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court ."
"Under the Unitary Executive Theory , the |0 Laws | of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual |1 authority | unless the |0 President | agrees with them ."
"And so |0 Congress | and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President , with no real authority over him ."
"And the |0 President | becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , |0 which | would be entirely under his personal control ."
"And thus the United |0 States | of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship , no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II ."
AND |0 THAT | IS WHY ALL |0 AMERICANS | SHOULD OPPOSE THE |1 NOMINATION | OF SAMUEL ALITO .

NASA & Company Diplomacy - Trying to keep Moon Landing |1 Hoax | a secret in modern times
Some strategies being used by NASA & Company in relation to China and other space planning countries are mentioned here after being gleaned from a news item underneath .
"|0 Country | has an Independent |1 strategy | = |0 NASA | & company to use "" Numero Uno "" |1 strategy | , try to assert , beat , mesh and control the space |1 program | of the country ."
"|0 This | can also be through political , economical , social , and technological influence ."
"|0 Country | not open or not have fixed |1 strategy | = |0 NASA | & Company to use "" freeze thawed "" |1 strategy | especially when the |0 country | has a challenging , growing and ambitious space |1 program | ."
"|0 This | can also be through political , economical , social , and technological influence ."
"Dependant = |0 NASA | & Company to use "" space station "" |1 model | to unify the |1 aims | of different countries ."
|0 This | is really an end goal aim of NASA & Company and also does not allow |0 anyone | challenging the moon landing |1 hoax | .
"The |0 target | for NASA & Company probably to get by 2018 all the ambitious space program |1 countries | shifting towards this model , through the propaganda of another moon mission ; deliberately failing |1 this | or trying hard for another moon landing hoax ; achieving the real |1 aim | of space unity between space programs of other countries ."
|0 China | launches its second manned spaceflight |1 mission |
Secretive |0 efforts | keep |1 outsiders | in the dark about the program 's goals
By MARK CARREAU

"|0 China | launched Shenzhou |1 VI | , its second manned spacecraft , early today in northwest China 's Gansu Province ."
"A |0 pair | of military pilots embarked on China 's second manned space flight early today , hurtling into orbit on a test mission |0 that | could span five days ."
"The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified as Fei Junlong , 40 , and Nie Haishen , 41 , by China 's official news agency ."
The successful |0 launch | from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China follows the solo |1 flight | of Yang Liwei in October 2003 .
His one - day |0 mission | vaulted his communist |1 homeland | into the elite circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - |0 that | can launch and sustain |1 humans | in space .
Most |0 experts | believe |0 China | intends to develop a small space |1 station | of its own over the next several years .
But |0 they | remain uncertain about whether |0 China | aims to beat the United |1 States | to the moon in its secretive space effort .
|0 President | Bush has directed |1 NASA | to return to the moon by 2018 with a new generation of human explorers .
"|0 China | 's "" is not a fly - by - night program , "" said |0 Joan | Johnson - Freese , an expert on national security |0 who | follows space |1 developments | in the Asian nation at the Naval War College in Newport , R.I ."
""" |0 They | are not in any hurry ."
"|0 They | want a |1 program | |0 that | will be a success , "" |0 Johnson | - Freese said ."
""" |0 They | are not going to rush |1 it | , because |0 they | do n't want |1 it | to be a budget buster ."
"|0 Economics | will be a big determiner in the speed of their program . """
"China 's overtures to join the U.S. - led |1 effort | to develop the 16 - nation international space |1 station | have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues , including the Asian country 's human rights policies and worries |0 it | could acquire |1 technologies | |0 that | could pose a security |1 threat | ."
The |0 freeze | thawed some after Yang 's 2003 mission .
|0 China | was among 30 nations invited to send a |1 delegate | to NASA - sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush 's strategy to reach the |1 moon | with astronauts as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other - deep space destinations .
""" |0 We | applaud China 's space |1 achievements | , "" NASA spokesman |0 Allard | Beutel said Tuesday ."
""" |0 We | wish |2 them | a successful |1 return | of their astronauts . """
"|0 He | stressed , however , that |0 NASA | would not follow this week 's Chinese |1 mission | through formal channels ."
"At present , there are no |0 plans | for additional meetings with foreign powers to discuss the Bush exploration |1 initiative | or to extend an |1 invitation | to China to join the space station |1 partnership | , |0 Beutel | said ."
"The |0 flight | of Fei and Nie could mark the |1 end | of the opening chapter in a three - phase Chinese space initiative , |0 Johnson | - Freese said ."
"The first |0 phase | , |0 she | said , will demonstrate the |1 capability | of a multi-compartment spacecraft |0 that | will leave a test |1 module | in orbit when the two |0 fliers | return to Earth ."
The Chinese program 's second |0 phase | will include |1 spacewalks | on future missions and demonstrations of docking and undocking techniques .
The final |0 phase | will feature the |1 assembly | and operation of a longer - duration space lab .
At least one |0 expert | believes China 's |0 intentions | might include a surprise |1 attempt | to circle the |1 moon | with astronauts before NASA 's planned lunar return .
""" The |0 Americans | would be wise to plan accordingly , "" said |0 John | E. Pike , director of the Alexandria , Va. - based GlobalSecurity.org , a small national security think tank ."
""" There is always the |0 possibility | |0 they | could jam |1 us | up , make |1 us | look like |0 we | are not numero uno , "" |0 Pike | said ."
"During the U.S. and Russian lunar race during the Cold War , |0 NASA | scored an early |1 coup | by circling the |1 moon | with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays ."
"As |0 it | turned out , the |0 Soviets | never made |1 it | to the moon ."
""" ( |0 China | ) could be the second country to do |1 that | , "" |0 Pike | said ."
""" |0 They | would get in line in front of the Russians ."
"And |0 they | would not have to land on the moon to take |1 us | down a notch . """
"Pike 's |0 concern | is based on China 's development of a new medium - lift rocket , the Long March V , and the construction of a new space launch complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea ."
"The two |0 developments | , |0 he | said , could eventually enable China 's space |1 program | to mature to the point that |0 experts | could assemble and launch from Earth 's orbit a |1 spacecraft | capable of circling the |1 moon | with astronauts and returning home ."

The main |0 reason | |0 I | wrote this |1 post | is to ask |1 anyone | reading |1 this | if |0 they | know of some way |0 I | can help put a |1 stop | to this Cat Holocaust .

"|0 I | think for starters , |0 myself | and those of you |0 who | believe in God could say a special |1 prayer | for them ."
|0 I | will .
|0 I | 've pasted the |1 email | for those |0 who | have n't seen or would like to re-read |1 it | .

"Subject : Civet Cats , James Rachels + a song"
"|0 This | is my first time posting to the list , so |0 I | feel somewhat embarrassed by "" promoting "" a |1 song | |0 I | wrote , but |0 I | think |0 it | is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy , but an abundance of human greed ."
"|0 I | 'm not sure if |0 any | of you know |1 much | about civet cats , but to brief |1 those | |0 who | might not know , |0 I | will quote |1 James | Rachels , author of World Hunger and Moral Obligation among many other animal rights - related books and articles ."
( |0 I | kind of see |1 him | to be for animal rights theory as |0 Peter | Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non-human animals ) .
"The |0 quote | is from an article entitled "" Vegetarianism and ` The Other Weight Problem ' """
"If |0 anyone | wants the complete |1 article | , email |1 me | , as |0 it | is a very good article |1 which | no meat - |0 eater | can read and not sense their own |1 hypocrisy | ."
But |0 this | is what |0 he | says about civet cats :
""" As an example , consider the |1 treatment | of the civet cat , a highly intelligent and sociable animal ."
"Civet cats are trapped and placed in small cages inside darkened sheds , where the temperature is kept up to 110 |1 F | by fires ."
They are confined in this way until |0 they | finally die .
|0 What | justifies this extraordinary |1 mistreatment | ?
These |0 animals | have the |1 misfortune | to produce a |1 substance | |0 that | is useful in the manufacture of perfume .
"|0 Musk | , which is scraped from their genitals once a day for as long as |0 they | can surv ive , makes the |0 scent | of perfume last a bit longer after each application ."
"( The |0 heat | increases their "" |1 production | "" of musk . )"
"Here Kant 's rule -- "" |0 Animals | are merely means to an end ; that |0 end | is man "" -- is applied with a vengeance ."
"To promote |1 one | of the most trivial interests |0 we | have , thousands of animals are tormented for their whole lives . """
"This |0 article | , and specifically this piece , effected |1 me | enough to try to build a |1 song | around the topic ."
"If |0 anyone | is interested in listening to this song , and in offering their |1 opinion | , whether |0 it | be positive or negative , |0 I | 'd appreciate |1 it | ."
"But |0 I | also hope no |0 one | feels any |1 obligation | to download , especially if |0 you | have an internet |1 connection | as slow mine ( 28 k ) ."
The |0 url | for the song is http://www.sonic.net/~fsjob/TragiCore-TheCivetCat.mp3
"Although there are no human vocals / |0 lyrics | , |0 I | think it's subject |0 matter | is audible ."
"Again , if |0 anyone | wants to read Rachels ' entire |1 article | , let |1 me | know ."
|0 It | 's also on the net .
"|0 I | was already a vegetarian when |0 I | read |1 it | a little more than a year ago , but |0 it | was one of the bigger factors for me in going completely vegan ."
|0 I | hope |0 all | are well .

.: GO VEGAN :.
MAKE |1 THOUSANDS | !!! --
|0 THIS | IS NOT A SCAM !!!
|0 I | found |1 this | on a bulletin board and decided to try |1 it | : |0 I | do n't care about the useless pre-fabricated crap this |0 message | usually says .
"|0 All | |0 I | say is , |0 it | works ."
Continue pre-fab |1 crap | .
WELL GUESS |1 WHAT | !!!
"Within seven days , |0 I | started getting |1 money | in the mail !!"
|0 I | was shocked !!
"|0 I | figured |0 it | would end soon , but the |0 money | just kept coming in ."
"In my first week , |0 I | made about |1 $ | 25.00 ."
By the end of the second week |0 I | had made a |1 total | of more than $ 1000.00 !!
"In the third week |0 I | had more than |1 $ | 10,000.00 and |0 it | 's still growing !!"
"|0 This | is now my fourth week and |0 I | have made a |1 total | of $ 42,000.00 and |0 it | 's still coming rapidly ."
"|0 It | 's certainly worth $ 6.00 and six stamps , and |0 I | have spent |1 more | than that on the lottery without ever winning !!!"
"Let |1 me | tell |1 you | how |0 this | works and most important , why |0 it | works .........."
"also make sure |0 you | print |1 this | out NOW , so |0 you | can get the |1 information | off of it , as |0 you | will need |1 it | ."
|0 I | promise |2 you | that if |0 you | follow the |1 directions | exactly that |0 you | will start making more |1 money | than |0 you | thought possible by doing |1 something | so easy !!
Suggestion : Read this entire |1 message | carefully !!
( Print |1 it | out or download |1 it | )
Follow the simple |1 directions | and watch the |0 money | come in !!
|0 It | 's easy .
|0 It | 's legal .
"And , your |0 investment | is only $ 6.00 ( Plus postage ) !!!"
IMPORTANT :
"|0 This | is not a rip - off , |0 it | is decent ; |0 it | 's legal ; and |0 it | is virtually no risk - |0 it | really works !!"
"If all the following instructions are adhered to , |0 you | will receive extraordinary |1 dividends | ."
PLEASE NOTE :
"Please follow the |1 directions | EXACTLY , and |0 $ | 50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days ."
This |0 program | remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants .
Please continue its |1 success | by carefully adhering to the instructions .
|0 You | will now become a part of the Mail Order business .
|0 You | are in the business of developing Mailing |1 Lists | .
Many large |0 corporations | are happy to pay big |1 bucks | for quality lists .
"However , the |0 money | made from the mailing lists is secondary to income which is made from |0 people | like you and me asking to be included in that list ."
Here are the four easy |0 steps | to success .
STEP ONE :
"Get six separate |1 pieces | of paper and write the |1 following | on each piece of paper "" PLEASE PUT |1 ME | ON YOUR MAILING LIST . """
Now get 6 U.S. $ 1.00 |1 bills | and place |1 ONE | inside of EACH of the six pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope ( to prevent |1 thievery | ) .
"Next , place one |1 paper | in each of the six envelopes and seal |1 them | ."
"|0 You | now should have six sealed |1 envelopes | , each with a piece of paper stating the above |1 phrase | , your name and address , and a $ 1.00 bill ."
|1 What | |0 you | are doing is creating a |1 service | .
|0 THIS | IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL !!!! !
|0 You | are requesting a legitimate |1 service | and |0 you | are paying for it !!
Like most of us |0 I | was a little skeptical and little worried about the legal aspects of it all .
So |0 I | checked |1 it | out with the U.S. Post Office ( 1-800-238-5355 ) and |0 they | confirmed that |0 it | is indeed legal !!
Mail the six |1 envelopes | to the following addresses :
1 ) G. Burrows 1 / 264 Tor St Toowoomba QLD 4350 Australia
"2 ) S Luest P.O. Box 366 Garden Grove , CA 92842 USA"
"3 ) G. V. & A. Bourret 41 Broome St , # 1 Brooklyn , NY 11222 USA"
4 ) R. Ansems Gen. Foulkesstraat 5 4641 BW Ossendrecht Netherlands
"5 ) W. Brumbley 4632 Hilton Ave Suite # 31 Columbus , Ohio 43228"
"STEP TWO : Now take the # 1 |1 name | off the list |1 that | |0 you | see above , move the other |1 names | up ( |0 six | becomes 5 , |0 5 | becomes 4 , and etc. ) and add YOUR |1 NAME | as number 6 on the list ."
STEP THREE :
Change |1 anything | |0 you | need to but try to keep this |1 article | as close to original as possible .
Now post your amended |1 article | to at least 200 news groups . :
"( |0 I | think there are close to 24,000 |0 groups | )"
"|0 All | |0 you | need is 200 , but remember , the more |0 you | post , the more |1 money | |0 you | make !!"
|0 This | is perfectly legal !!
"If |0 you | have any |1 doubts | , refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal Lottery laws ."
"Keep a |1 copy | of these steps for yourself and whenever |0 you | need |1 money | , |0 you | can use |1 it | again , and again ."
PLEASE REMEMBER that this |0 program | remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by |0 their | carefully adhering to directions .
Look at it this |1 way | .
"If |0 you | were of integrity , the |0 program | will continue and the |0 money | |1 that | so many |0 others | have received will come your |1 way | ."
"NOTE : |0 You | may want to retain every |1 name | and address sent to you , either on a computer or hard copy and keep the |1 notes | |0 people | send |1 you | ."
|0 This | VERIFIES that |0 you | are truly providing a |1 service | .
"( Also , it might be a good idea to wrap the $ 1 |1 bill | in dark paper to reduce the |1 risk | of mail theft ) ."
"So , as each post is downloaded and the |0 directions | carefully followed , all members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each ."
Your |0 name | will move up the list geometrically so that when your |0 name | reaches the # 1 |1 position | |0 you | will be receiving |1 thousands | of dollars in CASH !!!
What an opportunity for only $ 6.00 ( $ 1.00 for each of the first six people listed above )
"Send |1 it | now , add your own |1 name | to the list and |0 you | 're in business !!!"

Blue Planet : |0 Who | 's afraid of Big Bad Wolf ?
By Dan Whipple
UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
"Boulder , CO , Feb. 23 ( UPI ) --"
"Ever since |0 he | ate up Red Riding Hood 's |1 grandma | and blew down the |1 houses | of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad |0 Wolf | has held a persistently bad |1 reputation | ."
"In part because of that reputation , the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan 's Lake Superior ."
The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 .
"Western sheep and cattle |0 ranchers | , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their |1 hands | of the wolf and wrote |1 him | off as a job well done ."
"Their |0 sheep | could graze , their |0 cows | could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard ."
"After the major kill - offs , |0 wolves | outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend ."
"Like UFOs or Sasquatch , several |0 people | claimed to see fleeting lone |1 wolves | , usually in Yellowstone ."
"In the 1960s , a |0 group | shooting a |1 movie | in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive |1 wolves | , then released |1 them | when their |0 shooting | was done ."
"If so , this happy band has not been heard from since ."
"|0 Rumor | also had it some renegade |0 biologist | brought a caged |1 pair | to Yellowstone and released |1 them | into the wild sometime in the 1970s , hoping to reestablish a breeding |1 population | ."
"If true , the |0 caper | failed ."
"Over time , the wolf 's |0 absence | seemed to rehabilitate its |1 image | ."
"Eventually , a |0 trickle | of support appeared for bringing the |1 predator | back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains ."
"This |0 trickle | grew into a flood , resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still - continuing objections of ranchers ."
"These wolf |0 packs | have flourished , and now there are an estimated 850 |0 wolves | roaming the northern |1 Rockies | , where merely 10 years ago there were |0 none | ."
"One compelling argument for reintroduction was the |0 wolf | acts as a keystone predator , an animal |0 that | affects the |1 populations | , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range ."
Some recent |0 research | conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable |1 credence | to this idea .
"OSU forestry professors |0 William | Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that |0 wolves | actually promote stream - bank |1 stabilization | , although |0 they | have given the |2 phenomenon | the unfortunate |1 name | of "" the ecology of fear "" -- something |0 that | smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf 's relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs ."
"|0 They | explained that |0 elk | in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior |0 that | prevented the |1 saplings | from reaching mature |1 stages | and increased the |1 possibility | of soil erosion ."
"Since reintroduction , however , |0 Ripple | and Beschta have found , |0 fear | of the wolves apparently has discouraged the |1 elk | from spending too much |1 time | at stream banks -- where |0 they | are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings ."
""" |0 All | |0 you | have to do is look at the photographs , "" |0 Ed | Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , told UPI 's Blue |1 Planet | ,"
""" |0 You | say , ' wow ! '"
"An |0 area | |0 that | used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow . """
This simple |0 change | has triggered a veritable ecological |1 cascade | in Yellowstone .
"More streamside |0 willow | and aspen have meant better |1 habitat | for beaver , for instance ."
"Where there had been only one beaver |0 colony | in the park 's northern range before the |0 wolves | returned , now there are |0 nine | ."
""" |0 It | may be uninteresting to a lot of people , "" |0 Beschta | told Blue |1 Planet | ."
""" There 's a |0 lot | of impact on plants and |0 they | say , ' |0 Who | cares ? '"
But |0 we | 've been looking at streamside communities .
"Since wolf recovery , streamside |0 plants | , willows and cottonwoods provide |1 food | for other critters -- beavers , a whole variety of avian species , berry - producing |1 shrubs | |1 that | |0 bears | can use ."
|0 It | 's important with regard to the quality of streams .
The |0 plants | provide |1 shade | and root strength for bank stability .
"|0 Plants | are critical to wildland ecosystems . """
"|0 Yellowstone | has a vast elk |1 herd | , one of the largest in the world ."
"|0 Bangs | said although the |0 number | of elk has not declined very much since the |0 wolves | came back , their |0 behavior | appears markedly different ."
""" |0 I | 'm pretty suspicious of making broad |1 generalizations | , "" however , |0 he | cautioned ."
""" |0 Wolves | are still pretty new ."
|0 They | 've only been there for 10 years .
"In 10 more years |0 we | 'll have a better |1 idea | . """
"Wolf |0 reintroduction | in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife |0 Service | has moved to reduce the animal 's |1 status | from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove |1 it | from the endangered species list altogether ."
"|0 Bangs | said the |0 agency | has established viable wolf |1 packs | in the northern Rockies , as required by federal regulations ."
"Some |0 conservationists | want the |1 protection | extended so |0 wolves | can move into other states , including Colorado , Utah and Oregon , among others ."
"On Jan. 31 , Oregon Federal District Court |0 Judge | Robert E. Jones appeared to agree with them ."
|0 He | vacated the FWS |1 decision | to downgrade the wolf 's |1 status | .
|0 Bangs | said his |0 agency | is still reviewing the |1 decision | .
"Regardless of the wolf 's legal status , its future |0 expansion | into new areas now seems likely ."
|0 Wolves | can migrate considerable |1 distances | .
"A Yellowstone wolf was found dead , hit by a car , on a Colorado highway last year , several hundred miles from home ."
"Meanwhile , his |0 reputation | seems to be improving , although |0 Bangs | noted a "" pretty interesting social |1 dynamic | . """
"There are only about 850 |0 wolves | in the West , but there are an estimated 31,000 mountain |0 lions | ."
"Pound for pound , mountain |0 lions | eat more |1 game | and more livestock than wolves ."
"|0 They | even occasionally attack |1 people | , |1 which | |0 wolves | do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm ."
"Yet |0 people | seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain |1 lions | , despite the risks ."
|0 It | remains to be seen whether |0 they | will extend the same |1 courtesy | to the arriving gray wolf .
Regarding those rumors about wolves living in Yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction ?
|0 They | seem to be just that : rumors .
"True , there are about 300,000 |0 wolves | and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States ."
"|0 It | also is likely |0 people | have released |1 some | of these animals into the wild hoping |0 they | would survive -- for instance , a |0 ranger | in Glacier Park caught |1 someone | in this very act not long ago ."
"|0 Bangs | said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild , however , and |0 they | all almost certainly have died ."
"|0 He | said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves , |0 scientists | have not found a single |1 strain | |0 that | did not belong to one of the wolves the |0 agency | released -- or their descendants ."

"Climate : |0 Humans | fuss , |0 animals | adjust"
By Dan Whipple
UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
"Boulder , CO , Nov. 15 ( UPI ) --"
"|0 Scientists | can argue all |0 they | want about how many degrees Celsius -- or Fahrenheit -- the |0 planet | is warming and |1 what | the |0 trend | portends , but meanwhile Earth 's |0 plants | , insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome ."
|0 They | already are altering their |1 patterns | of behavior in response to |0 what | is happening .
"|0 It | turns out |0 one | of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non-human natural world to changing conditions , and |0 biologists | |0 who | study the |1 responses | have been aware for some years the |0 biosphere | is acknowledging global |1 warming | ."
"|0 Nina | Leopold Bradley , a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer Aldo Leopold , published a 1999 |1 paper | in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on her 61 - year uninterrupted phenological records ."
|0 Phenology | studies an organism 's |1 development | and life cycle -- the pulse of life .
"Bradley 's |0 record | of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999 , |0 spring | was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data ."
|0 Birds | arrived sooner on their migrations from the south and |0 plants | flowered earlier .
The Eastern |0 phoebe | is showing up about 20 days before |0 it | used to .
The forest |0 phlox | is blooming in late April instead of mid-May .
|0 Half | of the 300 phenophases |0 Leopold | tracked showed a |1 response | consistent with warming .
"In England , the |0 cuckoo | returns earlier ."
An |0 analysis | of 65 bird species in the United Kingdom shows about one - |0 third | are laying their |1 eggs | four to seven days earlier than |0 they | did 25 years ago .
""" |0 One | of the major , most well - documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical |1 distribution | of species and ecological communities , "" concluded a |0 report | titled "" Observed |1 Impacts | of Global Climate Change in the United States , "" released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week ."
Pew |0 researchers | looked at about 40 studies |0 that | could provide an |1 assessment | of whether |0 climate | was affecting |1 biology | .
""" |0 Half | of the studies provide strong |1 evidence | of a causal link between the biological change and climate change , "" said |0 Camille | Parmesan , a University of Texas - Austin biologist and one of the world 's leading experts on this issue ."
"These |0 changes | are occurring across all species , |0 Parmesan | told UPI 's |2 Climate | ."
""" Across the United States , the northern |0 edge | of species ' range is expanding , "" |0 she | said ."
"|0 Parmesan | has spent |1 much | of her career studying the checkerspot |1 butterfly | , |0 which | migrates between Mexico and southern California ."
Some localized |0 extinctions | already have occurred across some of its habitat .
""" Empirical |0 research | pointed to climate as being a strong driver , "" |0 she | said ."
""" There have been large |0 numbers | of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the |0 habitat | is still acceptable . """
"According to Parmesan 's earlier studies , one extinction event , for instance , was triggered when a checkerspot |0 population | migrated north prematurely , relying on a warming temperature signal , then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat ."
"Throughout the United States , |0 she | said , "" |0 spring | is about two weeks earlier ."
Tree |0 swallows | are nesting nine days earlier .
Tropical |0 species | have moved up to Florida and the Gulf Coast .
"Bird and butterfly |0 watchers | are seeing many , many new |1 species | coming up from Mexico and the Caribbean . """
"As the Pew |0 report | concluded , "" Sufficient |0 studies | now exist to conclude that the |0 consequences | of climate change are already detectable within U.S. ecosystems . """
"Such |0 consequences | include |1 shifting | and , in some cases , contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems ."
The |0 report | also found |1 alterations | of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage .
"The Alaskan |0 tundra | , for instance , has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more |1 carbon | from the atmosphere than |0 it | releases -- to "" being a net source of CO2 ( releasing more |1 carbon | than is stored ) because warmer |0 winters | have allowed dead plant |1 matter | previously stored in the soil to decompose and release |1 CO2 | . """
"The Pew |0 report | coincided with the release in Iceland of the "" Arctic Climate Impact Assessment . """
"The ACIA -- with participation by the United States , Canada , Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , the Russian Federation and Sweden -- was begun in 2000 ."
""" The |0 impacts | of global warming are affecting |1 people | now in the Arctic , "" said ACIA chair |0 Robert | Corell ."
""" The |0 Arctic | is experiencing |1 some | of the most rapid and severe climate change on Earth ."
"The impacts of climate change on the region and the globe are projected to increase substantially in the years to come . """
The |0 ACIA | found Arctic winter |0 temperatures | have increased 4 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 years .
"Arctic summer sea |0 ice | will decline by 50 percent by the end of the 21st century , the |0 assessment | found , with some |0 models | predicting complete |1 disappearance | of summer sea ice ."
""" Should the Arctic |0 Ocean | become ice - free in summer , |0 it | is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction , "" the |0 report | concluded ."
"As with so much climate research , not |0 everyone | agrees with these dire predictions ."
"A third |0 report | , "" The Impacts of Climate Change : An Appraisal for the Future , "" completed by the Britain - based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two , falls somewhat into that category ."
"On the one hand , the IPN |0 report | agreed "" Climate |0 models | generally predict that the temperature |0 rises | in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global |1 rise | ."
"|0 This | applies especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface |0 absorption | of solar radiation will greatly increase . """
"On the other hand , the |0 report | thinks the |0 news | might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries ."
""" The |0 impact | of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge , "" the IPN |0 report | said ."
""" A |0 warming | of the magnitude predicted is more likely than not to be beneficial to the fisheries of the North Atlantic . """
"The important commercial |0 species | |0 that | probably would benefit from warming include |1 cod | , haddock , saithe , herring , blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster ."
"Important |0 species | |0 that | probably would decline include |1 shrimp | , capelin , Greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish ."
Hidden in this laundry list -- and in the pile of studies examined by the Pew researchers -- is one of the fundamental chasms dividing |1 participants | in the global warming debate .
"The IPN |0 report | examines commercial fish |1 species | , but |0 it | neglects important non-commercial |1 animals | , such as seals and polar bears ."
"In a limited economic sense , therefore , the |0 organization | can argue |0 warming | might be a good thing ."
"The |0 problem | is whether |0 one | cares |0 what | happens to the polar bears , checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables ."
The Pew |0 researchers | tried to transcend the economic |1 argument | .
"|0 They | assumed a |1 value | -- unspecified -- for non-commercial species , and in doing so rendered the warming |1 news | a bit less rosy ."
"This |0 tug | - of - war over calculating economic |1 values | is the one |0 that | ultimately will have to be decided by humans , because |0 animals | and plants can adjust only so much ."
""" When |0 dandelions | have set the |1 mark | of May on Wisconsin pastures , |0 it | is time to listen for the final proof of spring , "" wrote |0 Aldo | Leopold in "" A Sand County Almanac . """

It is always interesting what |0 spin | the |0 press | will take .
"Certainly , |0 representation | of the US in other countries will have a certain |1 depiction | ."
|0 I | do n't believe that |0 folks | |0 who | believe that |0 America | is the land of opportunity will change their |1 views | from this recent news .

"|0 I | did n't expect to react that way , but when |0 I | was looking around my workplace in Nashua , New Hampshire , and |0 everyone | else looked pretty much like me , |0 it | was really very eerie ."

|0 I | do know that |0 this | will change the |1 face | of America .
|0 I | expect that |0 many | of the displaced people ( those affluent and those not ) will remain in the places they were evacuated to .

"Okay , |0 I | 'm new to this forum and really do n't like |1 Bush | , so my view |0 point | is slanted and |0 I | admit |1 that | ."
|0 I | rarely listen to the news or to what |0 politicians | or lawyers say because so |0 many | tell |1 lies | that |0 none | have |1 credibility | so what 's the |0 point | ?
|0 What | |0 I | know is that |0 I | have a close |1 friend | who's |0 aunt | disappeared in New Orleans .
"My |0 friend | did n't have computer |1 capability | , so |0 I | spent the |1 day | searching and posting online ."
"The |0 family | here ( California ) wanted to fly any family |1 members | from there to CA , so |0 they | could remain here until things got straightened out down there ."
The cousins could not be found because no |0 one | was sure of their married names .
The |0 hope | was that |0 anyone | looking for the Aunt would see the family |1 post | and know that |0 help | was available .
"|0 It | is Oct. 6 , and not one family member has been located ."
|0 What | |0 I | saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been used to evacuate |1 people | |0 who | had no |1 transportation | .
"|0 What | |0 I | heard was the |0 Mayor | of New Orleans , saying that |0 he | did n't order the |1 buses | or anything else to be used because |0 he | was waiting on someone else to tell |1 him | |1 what | to do ."
When common |0 sense | takes a back |1 seat | to politics and legal mumbo jumbo |1 what | have |0 we | become ?
"Recently , |0 Bush | addressed the |1 nation | ."
"About 30 seconds into his address , |0 he | started flogging the terrorist |1 issue | just one more time ."
Ironically |0 he | almost burst out laughing and |0 it | was all |0 he | could do to keep his |1 mirth | down to a barely controlled smirk .
Even |0 he | ca n't believe that |0 he | is trotting out this old |1 saw | again .
"|0 I | guess if |0 you | have a |1 schtick | |0 that | is a resounding success once , |0 you | ca n't help but trot |1 it | out every time your |0 act | is going sour ."
"Meanwhile , every |0 pocket | that can be lined is golden and the poor are shunted off radar yet again ."
"The |0 gall | of it all is that |0 Bush | is stumping for more money to build more |1 refineries | , when |0 what | |0 he | should do is pour |1 money | into making the |1 US | independent of OPEC or crude oil all together ."
"|0 We | have the |1 technology | ; if |0 you | are going to spend |1 billions | of dollars touting "" |1 FREEDOM | "" why not spend those |1 billions | making |1 all | of us free ?"
"Free of polution , free of oil dependency , and free of big business |0 that | is bleeding |1 us | dry for the short term good ( theirs ) ."

"|0 It | came from the nation whose |0 king | Enrique VIII adulterated the |1 Bible | so that divorce could be allowed and in this way be able to give loose |1 rein | to the many divorces from his wives and subsequent murdering of the same ones and to whom |0 God | provided a |1 wife | with six fingers as abomination ( Anne Boleyn ) ... once again 6 , number of the Beast ...."
"It is interesting to observe that this nation is nicknamed "" the Devil 's Island "" ."
"As the epithet of the government of Satan on that nation , the |0 center | of London , the so well - known Piccadilly Circus , takes it's |1 name | from an old brothel ( the "" Piccadilla House "" |0 which | means "" The |1 House | of Sin "" ) , disappeared nowadays ."
"The |0 antichrist | John Lennon , one of the Devil 's main puppets to destroy family , social and moral |1 values | and to begin the |1 disintegration | of mankind , did hit |1 Stuart | Sutcliffe ( the first bass player of the Beatles ) in the head with a club repeatedly in Hamburg ."
Some months later |0 Sutcliffe | died from brain haemorrhage because of John Lennon 's bruises .
|0 John | Lennon entered |1 stardom | being a murderer .
"The same |0 demons | |0 that | made |1 captain | Smith say "" Not even |0 God | can sink my |1 ship | "" spoke from antichrist John Lennon ( from Liverpool , base port to the Titanic ) saying : "" |0 Christianity | is on the go ."
|0 It | will vanish and shrink .
"|0 We | are more popular than Jesus and Pope "" ...."
|0 That | was the day that GOD 'S |0 CURSE | fell upon the world of Rock .
"One week after that declaration , ONLY ONE WEEK LATER , |0 Brian | Epstein , forger of the Beatle farce , died from an overdose ."
"From then on , the |0 Beatles | began to get involved in false religions and to preach |1 them | to the world ."
"John Lennon 's |0 divorce | followed , as well as |0 his | entering the |1 world | of black magic , as deeply as to buy the |1 apartment | . where the "" Rosemary 's baby "" had been filmed , previous property of Roman Polansky , and in that same apartment |0 John | Lennon had a |1 room | upholstered with black silk where |0 he | used to do his black magic |1 operations | ."
"Came the |0 disintegration | of the Beatles ' minds with LSD |0 which | has caused , among others , schizophrenic |1 lyrics | such as "" |0 I | am the Walrus "" and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like "" Revolution number 9 "" ."
"At the same time , the |0 devil | acted through his other main puppets with "" Sympathy for the devil "" |0 that | was when the |0 pact | of the Rolling Stones with Satan took the |1 life | of the founder of the group , the guitarist Brian Jones ( |0 who | refused to be a puppet of the devil ) , murdered by people sent by Mick Jagger , another assassin ."
"Antichrist |0 John | Lennon followed the Devil 's |1 strategy | writing |1 lyrics | such as "" |0 God | is a concept by which |0 we | measure our |1 pain | ... |0 I | do n't believe in Jesus , etc. , etc. , "" ( God ) and "" and no religions too ... "" ( Imagine ) ."
"Antichrist |0 John | Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ , and so |0 he | grew a |1 beard | and started to make a bogus |1 role | of Christ together with Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming "" |1 Peace | "" , being |0 then | when he was visited by the Canadian journalist |0 who | ridiculized and admonished |1 him | wanting to know about |1 what | |0 Lennon | meant when |0 he | wrote in the lyrics of "" The ballad of John and Yoko "" : "" the way |0 things | are going , |0 they | 're going to crucify |1 me | ... "" , The |0 CURSE | OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses |0 which | made |1 Lennon | give the |1 interview | to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine ( today condensed in the "" |0 Lennon | remembers "" book ) where |0 he | speaks about how bad |0 thing | were going for him blaming "" |0 whatever | is up there "" for it ( referring to God ) ."
The |0 CURSE | OF GOD carried on until he was shot dead .
"It is interesting to notice that he was shot seven times , being |0 seven | , as well as three , the holy numbers in Holy Cabalah tradition ...."
"After |0 George | Harrison , said arrogantly in a video filmed in his studio at Henley on Thames : "" |0 I | want to talk about the divinity of man "" , he was given throat |1 cancer | by GOD because of those words , |0 which | made |1 metastasis | and carried on to final death .."
"To Paul McCartney whose company 's |0 logo | was a person toying with the planets as if |0 he | was a god , and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that he was made "" Sir "" ( when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir , as long as |0 he | produces |1 money | for the nation ) , |0 GOD | provided |1 cancer | to the wife ."
"The advertising farce of how much |0 he | loved |1 Linda | ( woman whose |1 quality | |0 he | did not deserve ) , was exposed when it was known that |0 Paul | had an |1 affair | with Heather Mills , Linda 's intimate friend , with whom |0 McCartney | went on a trip to New York and to whom |0 he | bought |1 things | and presents , while |0 he | was still mourning for his "" dear Linda "" ."
"At the same time |0 McCartney | was going out with Heather Mills , |0 he | used Linda 's |1 death | for promotional ends , due to his waning popularity ."
"|0 Paul | was going out with Heather , but in front of the audience |0 he | played the faithful husband 's |1 masquerade | pretending to suffer for Linda , for the afore mentioned promotional ends ."
"|0 Paul | admitted that |0 he | made |1 Linda | suffer a lot , but |0 he | did n't say that |0 it | was because |0 he | felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual |0 power | was not the same , even though |0 it | has never been much ."
"The early |0 days | were the days of competition between Paul and his wife and John and his wife and |0 he | knew |0 he | had to compete with ugly John for the leadership of the band in front of their wives and having |1 Yoko | Ono made |1 him | aware of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality , |0 he | grew the |1 beard | |1 that | |0 we | see in the "" Let |1 it | Be "" film and started to show |1 pictures | of naked women in the same film , doing every |1 effort | |0 he | could to be seen as a man ...."
"It is easy to note the |1 uneasiness | of McCartney when |0 he | sings : "" |0 I | 've got a |1 feeling | , a feeling |0 I | ca n't hide ... "" in front of Yoko in the film ."
( |0 He | already had the |1 traumas | |1 that | his previous |0 girlfriend | Jane Asher had caused |1 him | when |0 she | made |1 him | aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners ) .
"|0 Paul | has such a big inferiority |1 complex | as a man , due to his effeminate face , body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality , that |0 he | found |2 himself | a handicapped |1 woman | with only one leg , so that |0 he | could stand out , being very conscious that a full |0 woman | would make |1 him | feel the |1 superiority | of virile men again , as |0 Jane | and Linda did ."
|0 This | is something |1 that | his ego |0 trip | of lucky bad musician could not face anymore ....
|0 He | is very conscious that |0 money | and fame can not buy |1 virility | and manliness .
"Besides being a murderer , |0 John | Lennon had sexual |1 intercourse | with homosexual Brian Epstein to get |1 him | interested in going to see the |1 band | at the Cavern , trauma from which |0 he | never recovered ."
"Because of the trauma |1 that | his homosexual |0 relation | with Brian Epstein had left |2 him | , |0 he | made |1 lyrics | such as : "" |0 You | can wear a |1 collar | and a tie , one |0 thing | |0 you | ca n't hide is when |0 you | 're crippled inside "" and gave |1 declarations | to the "" Rolling Stone "" magazine saying that "" sometimes |0 he | wore Texan |1 boots | to feel more secure as a man "" ."
The Beatles are very well known by people close to them for their arrogance and racism .
|0 One | of the manifestations of their racism is the rejection towards Japanese Yoko Ono .
That |0 rejection | got to the point that |0 George | Harrison kicked |1 Yoko | Ono in the Apple studios during the filming of Let |1 it | Be .
"When |0 John | asked |1 George | while |0 they | were having |1 lunch | about how |0 things | were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and |0 George | replied that |0 he | was number one in the Swedish hit parade , |0 John | said in a despective manner : "" ah !! .. in Sweden .. "" , as if |0 Sweden | was an inferior place or something alike ."
"In the Beatles ' song "" Get Back "" |0 they | advise black |1 Joe | to "" get back to where |0 you | once belonged "" , as if |0 England | was not a place for black people ."
"Sometimes back , |0 Paul | told |1 George | in the Apple offices that the new |0 generations | are a bundle of idiots and useless people , but in any way |0 they | would have also been slaves of the Beatles ."
The Jewish |0 marriage | living to the right of George 's house said that |0 he | is an arrogant person |0 who | does never return a |1 greeting | .
The newly married |0 couple | living on the corner in front of the entrance of George 's house ( Friar Park ) refers to him as an overbearing person to stay away from .
"The |0 receptionist | of "" Hand made "" , the former film making company of George Harrison said : "" |0 we | do n't have any |1 relation | with that man anymore and |0 we | do n't want to know |1 anything | about him "" ."
"It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison , |0 who | believed that the cinema |0 industry | would have worshiped |1 him | ."
Their |0 chauvinisms | got to the point that even |0 they | themselves hated each |1 other | .
|0 Paul | McCartney said that |0 George | Harrison is a nothing .
|0 George | Harrison said that |0 he | is tired of listening to |0 people | talk about John Lennon ....
"|0 George | Harrison said in a video that "" |0 Oasis | is a very untalented band and |0 they | should n't be playing at all "" , |0 all | of it being the truth , but the |0 Beatles | is also a band of very poor musicians , if musicians at all , |0 who | could only play a |1 couple | of elementary guitar chords and |0 who | are as untalented as Oasis ."
"The |0 Beatles | of the times of the "" Cavern "" sounded exactly as poorly as Oasis and the little musical |0 quality | in the songs of the Beatles is due to George Martin ."
Without George Martin the |0 Beatles | would have been just another untalented band as Oasis ....
"|0 Paul | McCartney said recently that |0 he | believes in using |1 magic | , and |0 he | does |1 lots | of charity , thinking that in this way |0 he | will compensate for the CURSE OF GOD |0 that | is upon him and |0 that | took his wife 's |1 life | because of his Satanism and involvement in black magic ."
"|0 He | thinks |0 he | will deceive |1 people | in this way , so that the real McCartney will not be perceived ."
Is the old |0 Devil | attempting to disguise as good in front of people .
"Satan deceiving |1 mankind | once again , as so many other thousands of times through the centuries ...."
"After the |0 Devil | began his devastating |1 job | from the ghostly "" Devil 's Island "" through his nine main puppets ( Beatles - Rolling Stones ) , |0 he | possessed an endless |1 amount | of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned Island and weakening their |1 conscience | with drugs , |0 he | made |1 them | proclaimers of homosexuality , aversion to religion , destruction of family values , dissipation , mental illness , antisocialism , etc. , etc. ,"
"The |0 fact | that bad apprentice |0 musicians | such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones achieved such a giant |1 fame | |1 that | not even the real quality |0 musicians | could achieve , was because the |0 forces | of Satan were behind everything , supporting the |1 process | ."
"This mentally ill |0 humanity | , destroyed families , twisted moral values , manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings , anti natural feminism rebellion , drug addiction , corrupt social outlines , mad youths without direction , non respect to hierarchies , convulsed nations , misanthropy , misogyny , paedophilia , irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations , are due to the vast manoeuvre |1 that | |0 Satan | executed through his main marionettes the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , from the Devil 's Island ."
"If |0 you | wonder why there is |0 misery | and curse in your house , |0 it | is because |0 you | own some L.P , |1 CD | or another article related to the CURSED BY GOD Beatles and Rolling Stones ."
|0 We | recommend |2 you | to take that |1 curse | out of your house throwing away |1 everything | related to the Devil 's main nine puppets ....

Attack on Iran : A Looming Folly
By William Rivers Pitt
t r u t h o u t | Perspective
Monday 09 January 2006
The |0 wires | have been humming since before the New Year with reports that the |0 Bush | administration is planning an |1 attack | on Iran .
""" The |0 Bush | administration is preparing its NATO |1 allies | for a possible military strike against suspected nuclear sites in Iran in the New Year , according to German media reports , reinforcing similar earlier |1 suggestions | in the Turkish media , "" reported |0 UPI | on December 30th ."
""" The |0 Berlin | daily Der Tagesspiegel this week , "" continued |0 UPI | , "" quoted ' NATO intelligence |1 sources | ' |0 who | claimed that the NATO allies had been informed that the United |0 States | is currently investigating all |1 possibilities | of bringing the mullah - led |1 regime | into line , including military options ."
"This ' all |0 options | are open ' |0 line | has been President George W Bush 's publicly stated policy throughout the past 18 months . """
An |0 examination | of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order .
1 . Blowback in Iraq
"The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist Shi'ite organizations , principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) ."
Both |0 Dawa | and SCIRI have umbilical |1 connections | to the fundamentalist Shi'ite leadership in Iran |0 that | go back decades .
"In essence , |0 Iran | now owns a significant |1 portion | of the Iraqi government ."
"Should the United |0 States | undertake military |1 action | against Iran , the |0 ramifications | in Iraq would be immediate and extreme ."
"In the first eight days of January , eighteen US troops have been killed in Iraq , compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday ."
"|0 Much | of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions |0 that | have their own |1 militias | , believe the last |0 elections | were a sham , and hold little political |1 power | in the government ."
"If the |0 US | attacks |1 Iran | , |0 it | is probable that American |0 forces | - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal |1 attacks | in Iraq from Shi'ite factions loyal to Iran ."
"The |0 result | will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties , US forces will be required to bunker |1 themselves | further into their bases , and US |0 forces | will find |1 themselves | required to fight the very |1 government | |0 they | just finished helping into power ."
"|0 Iraq | , already a seething cauldron , will sink further into chaos ."
2 . Iran 's Armaments
"Unlike Iraq , |0 Iran | has not spent the last fifteen |1 years | having its conventional |0 forces | worn down by grueling sanctions , repeated attacks , and two American - led wars ."
While Iran 's conventional |0 army | is not what |0 it | was during the heyday of the Iran - Iraq war - their |0 armaments | have deteriorated and the |0 veterans | of that last war have retired - the |0 nation | enjoys substantial military |1 strength | nonetheless .
"According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004 , |0 Iran | "" has some 540,000 |1 men | under arms and over 350,000 reserves ."
"|0 They | include 120,000 Iranian Revolutionary |1 Guards | trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare ."
"Iran 's |0 military | also includes |1 holdings | of 1,613 main battle tanks , 21,600 other armored fighting vehicles , 3,200 artillery weapons , 306 combat aircraft , 60 attack helicopters , 3 submarines , 59 surface combatants , and 10 amphibious ships . """
""" |0 Iran | is now the only regional military power |0 that | poses a significant conventional military |1 threat | to Gulf stability , "" continued the CSIS |0 report | ."
""" |0 Iran | has significant |1 capabilities | for asymmetric warfare , and poses the additional |1 threat | of proliferation ."
There is considerable |0 evidence | that |0 it | is developing both a long - range missile |1 force | and a range of weapons of mass destruction .
"|0 It | has never properly declared its |1 holdings | of chemical weapons , and the |0 status | of its biological weapons programs is unknown . """
"A MILNET |0 brief | issued in February 2005 reports , "" Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf , |0 Iran | has constantly been a threat to the Gulf ."
The so called ' Tanker ' |0 wars | in the late 1980s put |1 Iran | squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport |1 oil | out of the region .
"Even the small |0 navy | |1 that | |0 Iran | puts to sea is capable enough to harass |1 shipping | , and several |0 cases | of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical |0 tactics | of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective . """
""" More concerning , "" continued the MILNET |0 brief | , "" is the |0 priority | placed on expanding and modernizing its |1 Navy | ."
"The CSIS |0 report | cites numerous |1 areas | where |0 Iran | has funded |1 modernization | including the most troublesome aspect , anti-shipping cruise missiles : ' |0 Iran | has obtained new anti-ship |1 missiles | and missile patrol craft from China , midget submarines from North Korea , submarines from Russia , and modern mines . ' """
"|0 It | is Iran 's missile armaments |0 that | pose the greatest |1 concern | for American forces in the Gulf , especially for the US Navy ."
Iran 's |0 coast | facing the Persian |1 Gulf | is a looming wall of mountains |0 that | look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters .
"The |0 Gulf | itself only has one |1 exit | , the Strait of Hormuz , which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline ."
"In essence , |0 Iran | holds the high |1 ground | in the Gulf ."
Missile |0 batteries | arrayed in those mountains could raise bloody |1 havoc | with any fleet deployed below .
"Of all the missiles in Iran 's armament , the most |0 dangerous | is the Russian - made SS - N - 22 Sunburn ."
"These |0 missiles | are , simply , the fastest anti-ship weapons on the planet ."
The |0 Sunburn | can reach |1 Mach | 3 at high altitude .
"Its maximum low - altitude |0 speed | is Mach 2.2 , some three times faster than the American - made Harpoon ."
The |0 Sunburn | takes two short |1 minutes | to cover its full |1 range | .
"The missile 's |0 manufacturers | state that one or two |0 missiles | could cripple a |1 destroyer | , and five |0 missiles | could sink a 20,000 ton |1 ship | ."
The |0 Sunburn | is also superior to the Exocet missile .
"Recall that |0 it | was two Exocets |0 that | ripped the USS |1 Stark | to shreds in 1987 , killing 37 |1 sailors | ."
The |0 Stark | could not see |1 them | to stop |1 them | .
"The US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf , with some 7,000 souls aboard ."
"Sailing with the Roosevelt is the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike |0 Force | , |0 which | includes the USS |1 Tarawa | , the USS Austin , and the USS Pearl Harbor ."
The USS Austin is likewise deployed in the Gulf .
"The Sunburn |0 missile | , with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar |1 detection | , would do terrible |1 damage | these ships if |0 Iran | chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders ."
Beyond the naval threat is the |0 possibility | of |0 Iran | throwing its military |1 muscle | into the ongoing struggle in Iraq .
"Currently , the |0 US | is facing an asymmetrical |1 attack | from groups wielding small |1 arms | , shoulder - fired grenades and roadside bombs ."
"The vaunted American |0 military | has suffered 2,210 |1 deaths | and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare ."
"The |0 occupation | of Iraq has become a guerrilla war , a siege |0 that | has lasted more than a thousand days ."
"If |0 Iran | decides to throw |1 any | or all of its 23,000 armored fighting vehicles , along with any or all of its nearly million - strong army , into the Iraq fray , the |0 situation | in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire ."
3 . The Syrian Connection
"In February of 2005 , |0 Iran | and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "" |1 challenges | and threats "" in the region ."
"|0 This | was a specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq , and a reaction to America 's condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from Damascus ."
"An |0 attack | on Iran would trigger this mutual defense |1 pact | , and could conceivably bring |1 Syria | into direct conflict with American forces ."
"Like Iran , Syria 's |0 military | is nothing to scoff at ."
Virtually every credible |0 analysis | has |0 Syria | standing as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel .
|0 Damascus | has been intent for years upon establishing significant military |1 strength | to serve as a counterweight to Israel 's overwhelming capabilities .
"As of 2002 , |0 Syria | had some 215,000 |1 soldiers | under arms , 4,700 tanks , and a massive artillery capability ."
"The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter / attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons , totaling somewhere near 650 |1 aircraft | ."
"|0 Syria | also possesses |1 one | of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region , comprised primarily of SCUD - derived systems ."
"|0 Iran | , North Korea and China have been willing providers of state - of - the - art technologies ."
Compounding |1 this | is the well - based |0 suspicion | that |0 Syria | has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons |1 capability | in the Persian Gulf .
4 . China and the US Economy
"While the ominous |0 possibilities | of heightened Iraqi chaos , missiles in the Gulf , and Syrian involvement loom large if the |0 US | attacks |1 Iran | , |0 all | pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US / Iran engagement ."
"China 's |0 economy | is exploding , hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their |1 industry | ."
"In the last several months , |0 China | has inked |1 deals | with Iran for $ 70 billion dollars worth of Iranian oil and natural gas ."
"|0 China | will purchase 250 million |1 tons | of liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 30 years , will develop the massive Yadavaran oil |1 field | in Iran , and will receive 150,000 |1 barrels | of oil per day from that field ."
"|0 China | is seeking the |1 construction | of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea , where |0 it | would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China ."
Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat to its economic health .
"Further , any |0 fighting | in the Persian Gulf would imperil the |1 tankers | running China 's liquefied natural |1 gas | through the Strait of Hormuz ."
"Should |0 China | decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas |1 deal | with Iran , the US would be faced with a significant threat ."
"This |0 threat | exists not merely on a military level , though |0 China | could force a |1 confrontation | in the Pacific by way of Taiwan ."
"More significantly , |0 China | holds a large |1 portion | of the American economy in the palm of its hand ."
"|0 Paul | Craig Roberts , writing for The American Conservative , said in July of 2005 that "" As a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the United States , the Japanese |0 government | holds dollar |1 reserves | of approximately $ 1 trillion ."
China 's |0 accumulation | of dollars is approximately $ 600 billion .
South |0 Korea | holds about |1 $ | 200 billion .
These |0 sums | give these |2 countries | enormous |1 leverage | over the United States .
"By dumping some |1 portion | of their reserves , these |0 countries | could put the |1 dollar | under intense pressure and send U.S. interest |1 rates | skyrocketing ."
"|0 Washington | would really have to anger |1 Japan | and Korea to provoke such |1 action | , but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan , for example - |0 China | holds the |1 cards | ."
"|0 China | and Japan , and the world at large , have more dollar |1 reserves | than |0 they | require ."
"|0 They | would have no |1 problem | teaching a hegemonic |2 superpower | a |1 lesson | if the |0 need | arose . """
""" The hardest |0 blow | on Americans , "" concluded |0 Roberts | , "" will fall when |0 China | does revalue its |1 currency | ."
"When China 's |0 currency | ceases to be undervalued , American |0 shoppers | in Wal - Mart , where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in China , will think |0 they | are in Neiman Marcus ."
Price |0 increases | will cause a dramatic |1 reduction | in American real incomes .
"If |0 this | coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in the housing market , American |0 consumers | will experience the hardest |1 times | since the Great Depression . """
"In short , |0 China | has the American |1 economy | by the throat ."
"Should |0 they | decide to squeeze , |0 we | will all feel |1 it | ."
"China 's strong |0 hand | in this even extends to the diplomatic realm ; |0 China | is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , and could veto any |1 actions | against Iran proposed by the United States ."
5 . American Preparedness
American |0 citizens | have for decades taken |1 it | as a given that our |0 military | can overwhelm and overcome any |1 foe | on the battlefield .
The rapid |0 victory | during the first Gulf War cemented this |1 perception | .
"The last three |0 years | of the Iraq occupation , however , have sapped this |1 confidence | ."
"Worse , the |0 occupation | has done great |1 damage | to the strength of the American military , justifying the |1 decrease | in confidence ."
"Thanks to repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan , |0 recruiting | is at an all - time low ."
|0 Soldiers | with vital training and know - how are refusing to re-enlist .
"Across the board , the American military is stretched to the breaking point ."
Two vaunted |0 economists | - |0 one | a Nobel Prize winner and the |0 other | a nationally renowned budget expert - have |1 analyzed | the |1 data | at hand and put a price |1 tag | on the Iraq occupation .
"According to Linda Bilmes of Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia University , the final |0 cost | of the Iraq occupation will run between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion , surpassing by orders of magnitude the |1 estimates | put forth by the Bush administration ."
"If an |0 engagement | with Iran envelops our |1 forces | in Iraq , and comes to involve |1 Syria | , our |0 economy | will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many |1 countries | simultaneously ."
"Add to this the economic |1 threat | posed by China , and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast petroleum to the globe ."
"If |0 Iran | and Syria - with their significant armaments , missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq , our |0 troops | there will be fish in a barrel ."
Iran 's |0 position | over the Gulf would make |1 resupply | by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair .
"In the worst - case scenario , the newly - minted American |0 order | of battle requiring the |1 use | of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and imperiled |1 force | could come into play , hurling the entire |1 planet | into military and diplomatic bedlam ."
Conclusion : Is |0 Any | of This Possible ?
The question must be put as directly as possible : what |0 manner | of maniac would undertake a |1 path | so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe ?
"It is difficult to imagine a |1 justification | for any action |0 that | could envelop the United |1 States | in a military and economic conflict with Iraq , Iran , Syria and China simultaneously ."
"Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons , but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat ."
"Recently , Russian president |0 Vladimir | Putin bluntly stated that |0 Iran | is not developing its nuclear |1 capability | for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation , and pledged to continue assisting |1 Iran | in this endeavor ."
"Therefore , any |0 attack | upon Iran 's nuclear facilities will bring |1 Russia | into the mess ."
|0 Iran | also stands accused of aiding |1 terrorism | across the globe .
"The |0 dangers | implicit in any attack upon that nation , however , seem to significantly offset whatever |1 gains | could be made in the so - called "" War on Terror . """
"Unfortunately , all the |0 dangers | in the world are no match for the self - assurance of a bubble - encased zealot ."
What |0 manner | of maniac would undertake such a dangerous |1 course | ?
Look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
|0 George | W. Bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous |1 courses | of action in order to garner political |1 power | on the home front .
Recall the multiple terror |1 threats | lobbed out by the administration whenever damaging political |0 news | appeared in the media .
"More significantly , recall |1 Iraq | ."
"|0 Karl | Rove , Bush 's most senior advisor , notoriously told |1 Republicans | on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to "" run on the war . """
"The |0 invasion | of Iraq provided marvelous political |1 cover | for the GOP not only during those midterms , but during the 2004 Presidential election ."
"What kind of political cover would be gained from an attack on Iran , and from the diversion of attention to that attack ?"
The |0 answer | lies in one now - familiar name : Jack Abramoff .
"The |0 Abramoff | scandal threatens to subsume all the hard - fought GOP |1 gains | in Congress , and the 2006 |0 midterms | are less than a year away ."
Is |0 any | of this a probability ?
"|0 Logic | says no , but |0 logic | seldom plays any |1 part | in modern American politics ."

|0 It | s now my home .
My myTouch |0 4G | crashes with most custom ROMs |0 I | install .
Can that be fixed ?
"|0 I | really like the |1 MIUI | , but a |0 process | crashes repeatedly about every 3 seconds ."
And |0 I | ca n't even load the newest |1 version | of Cyanogen Mod .
not by the company ... as |0 you | voided your |1 warrenty | by installing custom |1 roms |
"|0 you | are best to either recover to the standard ROM , or find |1 one | |0 that | does n't crash ."
cynangon |0 mod | should work .
Have |0 you | tried using clockwork |1 recovery | ?
Get the older |1 version | of Cynagon mod .
Also |0 you | could use a stable |1 rom | like bugless beast and baked snake .
Those |0 roms | focus on speed and stability .
Or |0 you | could just use a home screen launcher |1 replacement | .
|0 I | would recommend go |1 launcher | or adw launcher .
|0 They | are both excellent and speed up the |1 phone | quite a bit .
As a mytouch 4g owner |0 I | know the |0 phone | is pretty fast and their is no |0 point | installing a |1 rom | .
Hope |0 you | read through this .
are the |0 moors | and penines in Yorkshire a lonely eerie place ?
and how big are |0 they | ?
|0 i | m 33 .
|0 i | ve never been to the yorkshire moors or penines at all ... |0 i | can see the |1 penines | in the far distance from my bedroom window .
when |0 i | watched |1 werewolf | in london ( great film ) |0 that | was the only time |0 i | saw the yorkshire |1 moors | .
can |0 anyone | give |2 me | |1 information | about them ?
"|0 They | can be bleak and eerie , often very exposed , often covered with antiquities like bronze age burial mounds , stone circles and settlements -- until late in the bronze age |0 they | were rich farmlands , then a |0 change | in the climate caused the |1 skies | to cloud over and |0 rain | to wash the |1 goodness | from the soil ."
The |0 people | abandoned their |1 farms | and religious sites and the |0 ground | |0 they | stood on became moorland .
"|0 They | can also be very beautiful when the purple |0 heather | is out , and |0 they | are habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflowers ."
|0 I | have a western pleasure |1 appy | |0 that | s really heavy on her left lead at the lope ?
My |0 appy | is very heavy on her left lead at the lope .
|0 She | seems to lope one |1 stride | and trot the |1 next | and repeat ...
"How could |0 I | work with her to get off her four hand , get |1 balance | , and lope smoothly and slowly ??"
"Put on a |1 pair | of spurs and before |0 she | makes that trot |1 step | , |0 it | 's in the feeling when |0 you | feel |1 her | think |1 trot | , tick |1 her | with the spur and lift with your body to keep |1 her | moving ."
If |0 you | concentrate on that feel just before the trot |0 you | can figure |1 it | out and the |0 timing | is essential to push |1 her | at that instant .
"Lope |1 her | to the left in circles , keep her |1 head | to the inside of the circle and push |1 her | but out , keep doing |1 this | if |0 she | breaks to a jog go a little bit bigger |1 circle | , till |0 she | can get enough |1 balance | to go small and small . |1 circles |"

dead pixel of my photos ?
just want to ask .. |0 i | have an nikon |1 dslr | .. |0 i | m wondering why if |0 i | zoom my picture |1 zoom | like almost 200 - 300 |1 percent | .. |0 i | can see some dead |1 pixel | ... is there |0 something | wrong with my camera body ?
lens ?
or what ?
please help |1 me | .. and |1 what | should |0 i | do to fix this |1 problem | ?
or |0 it | is normal ?
Are |0 you | sure |0 it | is n't dirt on the sensor ?
Put the |1 camera | on manual focus and set |1 focus | to infinity
Take a |1 photo | of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long |1 exposure | and smallest aperture |0 you | have - over expose by a couple of stops
|0 You | will see in the image if there is |0 dirt | as |0 that | will be the only thing in focus
|0 Cure | is to get the |1 sensor | cleaned
"There should be a Pixel Mapping |0 function | in the menu |0 that | will get rid of them , most |0 sensors | have a few dead and flipped |1 pixels | , |0 some | only show up on long exposures ."

New Zealand skilled migrant visa ?
If |0 you | apply for a skilled migrant worker s visa and it is accepted do |0 you | have to find |1 work | in the same sector as your skills on your application or can |0 you | take up other |1 work | if |0 you | ca n't find |1 something | in your own field .
"|0 I | have posted this |1 question | on the NZ visa site and ca n't get any |1 info | , does |0 anyone | know .???"
Watch out the |0 poles | are coming ..... my little butterfly
"|0 That | would be preferable but |0 it | does n't matter , could be something similar"
|0 It | depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa .
Your |0 visa | should say whether or not you are restricted to work in a specific sector .
If your |0 visa | does not restrict |1 you | from taking any |1 work | in New Zealand then |0 you | can work in any sector .
|0 It | only matters if |0 you | received an |1 offer | of employment or if |0 you | are currently working in New Zealand and used that |1 job | in your application to get your skilled migrant |1 visa | .
"In Chicago , what is the best |0 restaurant | to dine at on a budget ?"
"Downtown Chicago , Loop , North"
"Take the red |1 line | to Clark , then |0 you | turn right ."
Walk 2 |1 blocks | then turn right again .
Walk 2 more |1 blocks | then cross the |1 street | .
"|0 You | will get to a place called "" BIG |1 BOWL | "" ."
THAI FOOD AND ASIAN .
BEST PLACE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!
McDonald s
Not necessarily the restaurant but what |0 you | order when |0 you | get there and what time |0 you | go .
A |0 lunch | will be less expensive than a dinner .
|0 You | can order |1 appetizers | rather than a full meal and have just as good a |1 dinner | .
But the best |0 way | is to use |1 coupons | .
Check out |1 http://www.restaurant.com | lots of restaurants |0 you | can look at the menu and check out |1 prices | .
"|0 Yo | also may want to try "" small neighborhood "" |1 restaurants | and support family run |1 places | rather than the large corporate chains ."
Not that there is |0 anything | wrong with that because |0 they | also employ local |1 people | |0 that | live and shop in the area .
Is there any |0 cure | for mouse poison ?
"|0 I | found a poor little |1 mouse | walking around in my friend s house , and since |0 I | was able to catch |1 it | very easily ( normally |0 mice | move at the speed of light ) , and since |0 it | was acting unresponsive , |0 I | thought it was infected with mouse poison , since my |0 friend | uses |1 it | ."
"|0 I | know that the |0 mouse | will probably die , but |0 I | was wondering if there is any |0 cure | for mouse poison ?"
|0 I | just hate to see the poor |0 dears | experience a slow painful |1 death | that way :( .
"Without knowing the exact |1 poison | , no ."
A common |0 one | is arsenic and there really is n't a |0 way | to cure |1 that | .
Take the |1 mouse | to an emergency vet and have |1 them | use |1 CO2 | to put the |1 mouse | to sleep .
"Or , |0 you | can put the |1 animal | in a snap trap designed for rats or mice since |0 that | is the only really humane kill method for invasive animals ."
A quick |0 cure | would be Arm & Hammer to it's head .
Crayola Air - Dry Clay ?
Ok .
So |0 I | have a VERY long |1 list | of people |0 I | want to make Xmas |1 gifts | for and |0 one | of them is my best friend .
|0 She | loves |1 giraffes | and homemade things !
|0 I | am very artistic so |0 I | decided |0 I | was going to make |2 her | a giraffe |1 sculpture | .
|0 I | do n't have much |1 money | so |0 I | bought Crayola Air - Dry |1 Clay | .
|0 I | have sculpted the |1 giraffe | laying down .
The |0 key | is ... |0 I | have a few |1 problems | :
1 . |0 I | tested |1 it | out by making a figure |1 boat |
And after 4 days when |0 it | dried |0 it | was very fragile !
( like VERY not in a good way )
Is there any |0 way | to strengthen |1 it | ?
2 . What |1 kind | of paint do |0 I | use to paint the |1 giraffe | ?
3 . Is there any cheap |0 way | to give |2 it | a |1 shine | like |0 I | made |1 it | in a kiln ?
"air dry |0 clay | works on armatures , the |0 clay | has a minor shrink |1 percent | , so |0 you | can leave the wire |1 armature | inside , paint with acrylic paint"
taking young |1 cat | with me for a week out of state ?
good idea ?
|0 i | have a 3 - 4 month old |1 kitten | and |0 i | live in forida .
|0 i | am going to my grandma s in north carolina and |0 we | are going camping in a cabin in west virginia .
My |0 cat | is a outside cat but |0 she | loves |1 it | inside .
|0 she | is also good in a carrier .
Should |0 i | bring |1 her | ?
if so how quick will |0 she | adapt to a litter box inside ?
thanks
|0 We | took our |1 cat | Mitten camping .
|0 He | loved |1 it | .
But |0 he | was an inside / outside cat ( only one |0 I | owned - |0 rest | have been 100 0nside cats ) .
He was trained to a harness / leash for outside time but |0 he | knew to use the litter |1 pan | inside .
"If your cat is not trained to use the litter |1 pan | , |0 you | may have a |1 problem | taking |1 her | ."
NO !
"changing its |1 surroundings | too often will stress |1 it | out and |0 it | will get depressed , mean , sick , or will not want to be around you ."
What |1 cleaners | should |0 I | use for dusting around my parakeet ?
What |1 cleaners | can |0 I | use to dust around my budgie .
Would |0 pledge | be ok ?
"If not , |0 what | is ?"
Your best |0 bet | would just be a swiffer duster -- |0 they | do n't require |1 cleaner | .
"If |0 you | must use a |1 cleaner | , |0 pledge | should be fine if the area that |0 you | keep your |1 parakeet | in is well ventilated ."
"|0 I | have had |1 parakeets | for a VERY long time , and |0 I | use |1 pledge | ."
Just keep a |1 window | open for a while for fresh |0 air | to circulate .
|0 I | agree w the answer from Nothing .
Even a cotton |0 cloth | ( |0 I | like |1 diapers | ) |0 that | is barely damp w water will work fine .
|0 Swiffer | or any type of micro-fiber cloth is excellent .
"|0 I | use Miracle |1 Cloth | , |0 they | 're fantastic , just do n't use fabric |1 softener | or dryer sheets when cleaning |1 them | , |0 it | ruins their "" grabbing "" |1 ability | ."

Yes obviously the |0 USB | is region free |0 which | means |0 you | can use |1 it | anywhere .
And every |0 computer | manufactured in both Ireland & the UK are Region 2 aka PAL .
There wo n't be a |0 difference | since mobile |0 broadband | is supposed to be digital .
"But word of advice if |0 you | 're get your |2 girlfriend | a |1 laptop | make sure |0 it | s a good brand a not something like DELL , Acer , Asus , eMachines etc ."
just a heads up .

How do |0 I | take |1 care | of my newborn baby fish ?
"|0 I | am nervous that my other |0 fish | will eat |1 them | , and |0 I | do n't know |0 what | to feed |1 them | !"
|0 I | have counted around |1 25 | of them and |0 they | currently reside in a 20 gallon tank .
|0 You | could move all the |1 babies | into a fry net breeder or move |1 all | of the bigger fish ( also the parents ) to a different tank to avoid the babies getting eaten .
Feed the |1 babies | 3 - 4 times a day with flakes .
"Provide |1 plenty | of hiding places like rocks , plants , etc in the tank ."
It s natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if |0 all | of them survived your |0 tank | would be very overcrowded .
"Look in the pet stores for "" fry food "" or "" baby fish foods "" ."
what |1 kind | of newborn fish |0 you | have ?
some |0 parents | would not eat there |1 fish | till a certain age jack |0 dempsey | for example would not eat there |1 offspring | till |0 they | mature but |0 i | would move the baby |1 fish | into a smaller tank and feed |2 them | |1 flakes |

bearded dragon spikes ?
bit of a stupid question but do the |0 spikes | / spines ( |1 whatever | |0 you | call |1 them | ) on their side and face area ever go hard .
or are |0 they | just supposed to look like |0 they | are so |0 nothing | will try to eat |1 them |
|0 becca | is right .
|0 i | v owned |1 beardies | for ovr 3 yrs and |0 i | handle |1 mine | all the time .. |0 they | do nt go hard lik eneedle hard but |0 they | ar nt pillow soft .
|0 they | use |1 them | to look prickly .. would |0 you | try to eat a |1 cactus | [ if |0 u | had no |1 knife | ] |0 i | know |0 i | would nt .
|0 they | puff out to look bigger and badder and |0 they | can scratch |1 you | a lil if |0 u | r holding |1 them | to tight :)
|0 They | re not really hard .
|0 Beardies | are actually quite delicate .
|0 I | 'm assuming |0 it | 's to scare off |1 predators | / like how |0 they | will puff up their neck |1 spikes | to make |1 them | look bigger to predators or enemies .
|0 they | do nt hurt unless |0 you | r stupid enough to press on them .
|0 They | just are there as an adaptation .
what is a kimberwick bit used for ?
"Used as a help for horses |0 that | are quite strong pullers while hacking , hunting and doing cross |1 country | ."
|0 It | is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some |0 horses | appreciate |1 this | to give |2 them | more |1 room | in their mouths for their tongues .
"|0 It | is not as precise as a pelham bit because |0 it | only uses one |1 rein | , though the modern |0 ones | have two or three |1 slots | on which to put the |1 reins | ."
"The lower the |0 reins | , the stronger the |0 action | and the lower the |0 reins | the stronger the |0 action | on the poll too ."
Useful for younger kids |0 who | do not have big enough |1 hands | or the ability to handle two |1 reins | independently .
For horses |0 that | are strong pullers .
|0 It | just gives |2 you | a little |1 leverage | and curb pressure .
|0 It | 's nice for horses |0 that | need a little |1 more | than a snaffle .
"|0 I | know |0 that | 's vague , but it depends on the horse ."
"The |0 rider | needs to have independent |1 hands | as well , because |0 you | do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that . ;)"

"took a |1 bit | of searching to discover that |0 POP | is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes |0 plaster | of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact , if |0 you | are building up |1 plaster | ( "" the way |0 you | would icing "" ) to do |1 sculpting | , |0 which | is rather uncommon , |0 you | keep the set |1 plaster | damp in order to add more unset |1 plaster | or |0 you | have to wet the |1 area | where |0 you | will be adding plaster "" |1 mud | """
|0 Plaster | of Paris does two |1 things |

"- |0 it | dries out , losing the |1 water | that is soaked into the set structure"

Dwarf |0 Hamster | Making Too Much |1 Noise | On Wheel at Night ?

"|0 I | 'm quite sure , |0 you | do n't even have to buy |1 another | , |0 all | |0 you | need to do , is to pour some |1 oil | on the wheel , or even put some |1 rubber | on it's edges , the part |0 that | is making the |1 noise | ."

Change of boarding station ?
How can |0 I | change my boarding |1 station | against the ticket |0 I | booked a month back from counter ?
"My origin |0 Station | is Howrah , but |0 I | want to board at Asansol .."
Does your |0 train | pass |1 Asansol | when starting from Howrah ?

Even if |0 you | do n't find the foreigner 's |1 office | |0 you | 'll be fine in the normal Reservation Office of any big train station .
|0 This | is where |0 you | can get AND change express train |1 tickets | .
"well if your desired boarding |0 station | comes after more than 2 or 3 halts of the actual boarding point , then the |0 TC | will cancel you |1 ticket | and allot the |1 seat | to others ."

Yes |0 I | 've had 53 different |1 kinds | of rodents and |0 two | were dwarf hamsters |0 they | flatten into a pancake and slide right through the bars and are able to open the |1 door | so yes a plastic |0 cage | will be good
Hi
|0 This | is the cage |0 I | have |0 whhich | is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to escape from :
http://www.petsathome.com/shop/combi-1-dwarf-hamster-cage-by-ferplast-15986
"|0 I | love this |1 cage | , |0 it | 's easy to clean , very spacious and fun for the hamster"
"|0 Aquiriums | are good also , but provide a mesh |1 top | for an easy airway ."
"Wire |0 cages | are NOT acceptable for dwarfs really , unless the |0 bars | have less than half a |1 cm | between them ."

Traveler s guide - For the young and unknowledgeable ?
|0 I | am 17 years old .
|0 I | do not get along with my family .
|0 I | dislike this urban |1 society | and want to leave this whole |1 enviroment | .
|0 I | am very unhappy here .
|0 I | do n't know the best |1 way | of doing |1 it | .
Would it be best for |0 me | to finish |1 college | ?
wait for 18th birthday ?
|0 I | live in London .
|0 I | want to go travelling .
"My |0 parents | do not like |1 me | , |0 They | constantly reassure |1 me | that |0 they | will throw |1 me | out of home when |0 I | turn |1 18 | ."
|0 I | do n't particularly want to stay with them atm either .
But right now |0 it | s the most convenient thing to do .
Anyway Advice for travelling .
What is the best |0 way | of doing |1 it | ?
|0 Hotels | for travelling will be expensive .
|0 anybody | is open to answers but |0 I | would much prefere |1 somebody | with traveling experience .
|0 I | want to go all over :) |0 I | do n't have a set |1 route | yet .
Get a back |1 pack | and sleeping bag or good warm blanket .
|0 Wool | is best .
"Light , warm , but also itchy ."
Hit the |1 road | .
|0 You | can always beg for spare change when |1 you | get hungry .
Should get some survival |1 skills | before setting out on your own .
"Vietnamese girl 's name , Mayko ?"
|0 I | always thought |0 Mayko | or Meiko is a Japanese name .
The Canadian Regenesis |0 actress | Mayko Nguyen has Japanese |1 connection | or is |0 it | her fake name ?
"Right , |0 I | could n't find any proven |1 source | for that ."
"And her last |0 name | , Nguyen is a typical Vietnamese family name ... anyone ?"
"Certainly , |0 Nguyen | is the one of first names of many people in Vietnam , only in Vietnam ."
|0 Mayko | is relating to the Japanese .
"In Vietnam , when a baby was born , they must be named "" first |1 name | "" according to that of their fathers ."
"|0 It | 's principle except a number of cases , for example , the |0 babies | are orphans or not to have |1 father | ."
E.g .
"Full |0 name | of the father is : "" Nguyen Thanh Luan "" ===> Full |0 name | of the son / daughter certainly is "" Nguyen .......... "" , for instance , "" Nguyen Thi Thuy Lan "" ."
"But if the babies were born in American so they would named in other way but still remain "" First name "" in order to recall about their origination ."
|0 I | 'm pretty sure that |0 Mayko | is Japanese .
|0 She | is a Canadian born Vietnamese .
|0 I | 'm not sure where her first |0 name | is from ...
|0 I | have a splitter / |1 filter | between my ADSL and ph line ?
"|0 I | have 2 |1 phones | running on the same line and the ADSL which is connected to one of the phones and the filter , |0 I | 'm still getting a |1 buzzing | noise even when |0 I | have disconnected the other |1 phone | without one ."
Why is |0 it | stil doing |1 this | even though |0 I | do n't have the other |1 phone | connected ?
Woud |0 it | be better if |0 I | got another |1 filter | and connected the other |1 phone | as well ?
turn the |1 modem | off and see if the |0 sound | is still there ... could be static on the line ... if the |0 sound | is still there with the modem off then the |0 problem | is NOT the DSL ....
"if the |0 trouble | goes away with the modem off , then make sure that EVERYTHING EXCEPT the modem is filtered , |0 this | would include the alarm |1 system | , fax machine , satellite boxes , phones , etc ..."
"if everything is filtered , and |0 you | still have this |1 problem | - try changing the |1 filter | - if |0 it | is still there , try doubling up on the filters ..."
"|0 You | need either a |1 filter | for each device except the DSL modem , or a whole home filter |0 which | filters all the |1 jacks | , except the one |1 which | the DSL |0 modem | connects ."
Best way to change 35 mm |1 film | in Holga 120 whilst out and about ?
"|0 I | 've modified my |1 Holga | 120 to take 35 mm |1 film | and |0 I | know that |0 you | ca n't wind the |1 film | back , |0 you | have to open the |1 back | of the camera ( in a darkroom ) to rewind the |1 film | ."
|1 What | do other Holga |0 owners | do when |0 they | need to change |1 film | when |0 they | are traveling ?
Do |0 you | just take a changing |1 bag | with you ?
What s the easiest |0 thing | ?
Well a changing |0 bag | would be the easiest solution .
|0 It | 's light proof and makes sure |0 you | get no |1 problems | when opening the |1 camera | .
|0 You | can work comfortably and make sure your film is not scratched etc .
It 's really difficult to find a |1 place | |0 that | is absolutely dark and accessible to you when |0 you | 're outside .
A changing |0 bag | folds neatly and does not take much |1 space | in your bag .
A film changing |0 bag | is a handy way of unloading your exposed |1 film | in the field .
"Many online |0 stores | carry |1 them | , like Adorama :"
http://www.adorama.com/BLCBS.html
|0 I | have a few how to |1 videos | for DIY 35 mm film in a 120 camera on my YouTube channel :

Should the statue of David be censored ?
|0 I | 'm a sophomore in high school doing a |1 presentation | on Italian Arts and my |0 teacher | is making |1 us | censor the |1 Statue | of David .
My |0 argument | is |0 it | 's art and therefore should not be censored |0 he | 's making |1 us | censor |1 it | |0 who | 's right
"no , |0 it | 's only a body of a young man"
the |0 city | of florence did at one time in the past put |1 clothes | on the statue
"An art teacher in the mid-cities area of Dallas / Ft. Worth metro got fired because |0 she | took an art |1 class | on an approved field trip with parental permission for each student and some hysterical |0 parent | discovered that |0 they | saw "" |1 nudes | "" in the museum ."
|0 You | do n't think |0 is | was because of female nudes considering the nearly naked |1 girls | / women seen at pools and beaches and the completely naked manikins |0 that | show up in store windows in malls during changes in display ?
"No , |0 it | was guys ."
Your |0 teacher | knows |0 what | goes on in your community and wants to keep her |1 job | .
Let |1 her | do |1 it | - argue when |0 you | are of age and can battle the other |1 adults | in your community - skipping of course telling your |2 boss | |0 he | / she is a prudish ignoramus because |0 you | want to keep your |1 job | .
Better Steakhouse in Philadelphia ?
|0 I | am taking my |1 wife | out for our first year wedding anniversary and |0 we | both agree that |0 we | want a good |1 steak | .
|0 We | are staying at a hotel in Center City Philadelphia so |0 I | wanted |1 something | close .
|0 I | have spent the |1 afternoon | looking around from menu to menu ...
|0 I | have also looked at the photo galleries for an inside look at the decor of the restaurants and |0 I | have narrowed |1 it | down to three establishments .
|0 I | have never been to any of these places so any |0 suggestions | and or advice would be most welcome .
"It 's narrowed down to Butcher and Singer , Davio 's , and Del Frisco s ."
Thanks in advance for the advice .
"Sidenote ... |0 I | am familiar with the Capital Grille , Barclay Prime , The Palm , The Prime Rib , Morton s , Ruth Chris ' , etc ."
|0 I | have weighed those |1 options | and found the |1 three | |1 that | |0 I | have chosen to be more my wife and my own taste .
Please only reviews on the three |0 I | mentioned earlier .
Many thanks .
|0 I | am only familiar with Morton 's and Ruth Chris .
|0 I | have never eaten at the ones |0 you | have listed nor do |0 I | know of anyone |0 who | has .
|0 I | hope |0 you | get your |1 answer | .
"Anyway , have a lovely first |1 anniversary | !"
HAMSTERS - will a |0 hamster | be ok living in the bathroom ?
in his cage in the bathroom ?
or would the |0 steam | from the shower be a problem ?
thanks d
"If |0 space | is minimal , or |0 you | are keeping |1 him | in there to be kept away from other pets , then |0 I | can understand why |0 you | would choose to keep |1 him | there ."
There are some |0 things | to consider though ...
"|0 Rodents | require special |1 bedding | in their cages to absorb their |1 waste | , and |0 this | needs to be cleaned regularly , or your |0 hamster | could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine ."
"When |0 you | take a warm |1 shower | and build up |1 steam | , his |0 cage | will collect |1 water | , the |0 bedding | will absorb |1 much | of it , and will not be able to absorb the |1 urine | quite as |0 it | should ."
|0 You | will also have to be wary of |0 mold | forming on any toys or hide - aways |0 he | may have .
|0 You | also do n't want |1 it | getting too warm for him too often .
"Overall , |0 it | is not a good solution , but |0 you | can keep |1 him | healthy and pull |1 it | off if |0 you | take the |1 time | to give |2 him | the extra |1 care | |0 he | will need because of it ."
|0 It | may be a problem because the |0 temperature | is constantly changing .
|0 I | would personally put |1 him | somewhere else .

|0 I | found an injured pure white |1 bird | ( dove |0 I | guess ? )
|1 what | do |0 I | feed |2 it | ?
"|0 I | found this pure white |1 bird | in my neighborhood , its |0 wing | is injured , so |0 I | 'm currently taking |1 care | of it ."
"|0 It | 's pure white , no marks or streaks or anything , |0 I | do n't know what type of bird |0 it | is , probably a dove ?"
|1 What | should |0 I | feed |2 it | ?
Is normal bird |0 food | fine ?
"( Because apparently my |0 mom | is very picky , |0 she | says the |0 bird | might get sick if |0 it | does n't eat the right |1 food | ) IS there any specific |0 food | |0 I | might find at any pet shop ?"
"( petco , petsmart ) ..... thanks !"
"|0 Doves | are a species of pigeon , |0 they | are Seed eaters , |0 they | do not eat |1 bread | , or worms ."
make sure that |0 you | have a shallow |1 dish | of water for it .
as |0 they | can drink a |1 lot | .
there 's these little like bait |0 worms | at jack s . petshoppe .
|0 it | s jack s aquarium and pets |0 I | believe . ?
anyways |0 I | feed |1 them | to my road sometimes .
like a little container .
or buy small bait |1 worms | .
|0 that | should work
"If |0 you | have a pet |1 store | near buy some |1 wheat | , pigeon |0 corn | or even mixed bird seed will do , but do not feed |1 bread | ."

ty
On the RER / Metro :
"In the airport , follow the |1 signs | |0 that | say "" |1 Paris | by train "" ."
Buy a |1 ticket | for Paris .

"Stay on it until the "" Saint - Michel Notre - Dame "" station ."
"Change there to the Metro 4 line going toward "" Porte d' Orleans "" ."
"Get off at the "" Montparnasse Bienvenue "" station ."
On the Air France bus :
"As |0 I | recall , this |0 bus | drops |1 you | off near the Opera in Paris ."
|0 You | 'll still have to take another |1 bus | or the Metro down to Montparnasse .
"On the bus : Get on Bus 95 going toward "" Porte de Vanves "" ."
Buy a |1 ticket | from the driver .
"Stay on the bus until the "" Montparnasse Bienvenue "" stop ."
On the Metro : Get in the Metro at Opera .
"Take the 8 |1 line | toward "" Balard "" until the "" Invalides "" station ."

|0 You | could also try |1 this | in gimp .
"|0 It | will give |2 you | a lot more |1 power | , as well as control over how your black and white |0 photo | looks :"

try |1 something | like photoscape |0 which | has different |1 options | ...
cheapest plastic surgeons in Thailand ?
|0 I | want to go to thailand to do my boob |1 job | from South Africa but looking for the cheapest surgeons yet also good in his artwork on a human s body .
Only a |0 fool | would base a |1 decision | using the cheapest |1 surgeon | to perform an |1 operation | .
Cheapest |0 surgeons | work out of some small clinic and do not have the |1 skills | |0 you | are looking for . .
Do |0 you | really want to put your |1 faith | in some clinic doctor .
|0 I | know |0 I | would n't .
|0 You | need to check with one of the major hospital |0 that | performance this |1 procedure | like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital .
Would |0 you | choose the cheapest |1 brakes | for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too ?
"Sometimes the "" |0 cheap | "" comes expensive !"
"When |0 you | have invasive |1 surgery | |0 you | could also get |1 infections | , accidental nicks and cuts |0 that | cause other |1 problems | too !"
If |0 they | screw up |0 you | could be in worse shape than |0 you | are now !
Bumrungrad |0 Hospital | does some good |1 work | but all |0 hospitals | do have their |1 problems | from time to time .
Maybe having an experienced |1 doctor | might be better than some guy |0 that | is cheaper but less experienced !
http://www.bumrungrad.com/en/patient-services/clinics-and-centers/plastic-surgery-thailand-bangkok/breast-augmentation-ba
The cheapest * high quality * plastic |0 surgeons | are at Yanhee Hospitals .
|0 They | do outstanding |1 work | .

my Tom |0 cat | will not eat |1 meat | just the juice in the can .?
When |0 I | open a |1 can | of meat with gravy |0 he | licks off the |1 gravy | and lets the |1 meat | lay .
|0 I | must through |1 it | away .
Why ?
"If |0 you | knew what |0 kind | of "" meat "" |0 they | put in canned cat food |0 you | 'd understand |1 this | ."
|0 I | 've had a |1 lot | of cats |0 who | refused to eat the canned |1 food | .
When |0 you | read the |1 label | it s easy to understand why .
|0 I | 've had |1 cats | for 35 years and |0 I | only feed |2 them | dry |1 food | .
|0 They | have done very well and like the dry |1 food | better .
|0 It | had better nutritional |1 value | and |0 it | s also less expensive .
Canned |0 food | is often suspect as to the actual contents and |0 you | 're paying for a high moisture content instead of food content .
There are a |0 lot | of good quality dry cat foods .
Read the |1 labels | for contents .
Your |0 cat | will adjust quickly .
|0 You | 'll also have less |1 spoilage | .
|0 He | might be sick take |1 him | to the vet to see
"If |0 he | always does |1 this | , welcome to the club ."
"My oldest |0 female | and youngest male do |1 this | - |0 I | just grab the |1 blender | and pop in some other |1 stuff | for them like chicken liver ( cooked ) for the anemic one , some arthritis stuff for the oldest ."
"Even if |0 you | mash |1 it | with a spoon |0 he | ca n't do |1 that | ,"
What s your favorite |0 part | about trail riding ?
My favorite |0 part | is going up hill and cantering :)
"|0 I | love how |0 it | really depends on how good a horse your |0 horse | really is , not how talented |0 he | is ."
"If |0 you | took some Olympic - level |1 horses | on a trail ride , |0 they | just could n't do |1 it | ."
|0 They | would be too scared and spooky .
"It does n't matter how graceful your |0 horse | is , or how high |0 he | can jump , or how well |0 he | does a sliding |1 stop | ."
"What matters is how well trained |0 he | is , and how good your |0 bond | it ."
|0 That | is another reason why |0 I | like competitive trail |1 riding | also .
"|0 Nobody | pays |1 someone | to keep their |1 horse | in shape and rides once a week , then takes all the |1 ribbons | at the show because their |0 horse | is good ."
|0 YOU | have to spend the |1 time | training .
And |0 I | have not met one stuck - up trail |1 rider | !
"|0 Those | are just a few reasons why |0 I | love trail |1 riding | , competitive or not ."
"Same , when |0 I | 'm galloping in an open space like that |0 I | can just forget |1 everything | ."
Seeing the |1 nature | and wild life that if |0 you | keep quiet |0 you | can get up close and personal .
|0 I | have had several close |1 encounters | with both foxes and wild deer .
Also |0 woodpeckers | were pecking in the trees and |0 I | just sat and watched .
Fascinating .
10 gallon nano reef ideas ?
"|0 I | have a 10 gallon nano |1 reef | with 10 lbs of live fiji rock , and 10 lbs of live carribean sand ."
|0 I | am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a |1 tank | this size .
|0 I | am currently maintaining a gravity |1 level | of 1.024 .
|0 I | have a 10 gallon |1 filter | on it .
"|0 I | also have a |1 powerhead | , getting |1 another | soon ."
"|0 I | have a few |1 questions | , first |0 I | want to start a sump |1 filter | , but |0 I | have no |1 idea | on how the water |0 intake | and water return would work ."
How would |0 I | need to set a |1 sump | for this 10 gallon ?
Do |0 I | need a protein |1 skimmer | or any other equipment ?
thanks
Unless the |0 tank | has a built in overflow |1 box | ( |1 which | |0 I | 'm certain |0 it | does n't ) then |0 you | have to get |1 one | of those hang on back overflow boxes so that |0 you | can install a |1 sump | .
The |0 piping | would lead down into your sump from the overflow box .
"On the other end of the sump , |0 you | would have a small return |1 pump | with a hose |0 that | puts the |1 water | back into your tank ."
"If |0 you | 're going to go through the trouble of creating a |1 sump | for this tank , getting a protein |1 skimmer | would n't be a bad idea ."
"The Hydor SlimSkim |0 Nano | is a good nano protein skimmer , |0 it | 's an in - tank design |0 that | could easily sit in your sump ."
NOOK Color or NOOK Tablet ?
From what |0 I | understand |0 they | 're pretty much the same thing .
"|0 Some | of the major differences |0 I | see is the HD video , longer battery life , and faster processor |1 that | the NOOK |0 Tablet | boasts ."
Does the |0 Tablet | have a major |1 difference | in speed compared to the Color ?
|0 I | do n't want an |1 iPad | or Kindle .
|0 I | just want an |1 e-reader | |0 that | does a little bit |1 more | than just read .
"Yes , |0 I | know about the Kindle Fire but |0 that | 's not what |0 I | want (: Does it make |1 sense | to shell out the extra fifty |1 dollars | ?"
Or just purchase the |1 Color | ?
"Well |0 I | recently bought the Nook |1 Color | , and |0 I | have to say that |0 I | am very happy with it ."
|0 It | is like a mini tablet itself !
"When |0 I | found out |0 them | came up with the Nook Tablet , |0 I | was pretty disappointed though , because |0 I | bought my Nook |1 color | for the same darn price !"
So |0 I | say |0 you | should go for the more updated Nook Tablet .
|0 I | 'm pretty sure |0 it | 'll be worth |1 it | .
Have |1 fun | !
Judging by Nook Tablet 's processor |0 it | 's supposed to be quite faster !
"Basically Nook Tablet |0 it | has more |1 memory | , better battery life and a better processor and a microphone ."

|0 We | just moved to a town outside Philly a couple of months back so |0 I | 'm not an expert on the area .
A little |0 help | is always great . =)
Thank |1 you | or your feed back .
"Oh my , |0 you | asked this |1 question | at the perfect time ."

How to start a new fish |1 tank | ?
|0 I | 'm getting a 10 |1 gallon | for my betta tomorrow and |0 I | just want to know how to properly set |1 it | up .
|0 I | 'm still a beginner .
Any and all |0 suggestions | on what |0 I | need to do and buy will help .
Thanks .
When |0 you | get the |1 tank | make sure |0 you | wash the |1 inside | ( with plain water ) then |0 you | wash the |1 gravel | ( with only water too ) take out all the |1 stuff | |0 that | is floating on top .
Add only silk |1 plants | as plastic |0 ones | may tear up ur betta s delicate |1 fins | .
|0 You | add the |1 water | and put water |1 conditioner | into the water .
Start up your |1 filter | ( sponge |0 filters | are the best for bettas ) and put in a |1 heater | and set |1 it | to anywhere between 78 - 82 .
Wait about 2 weeks or 3 and test your |1 water | .
If |0 everything | is looking good |0 you | may add you |1 betta | to its new home .
|0 Lights | are optinal since |0 fish | need the |1 light | turn off at night anyways and an air |0 pump | is not nessasary since |0 they | get |1 air | from the surface .
"ask the |1 people | selling |2 you | the |1 fish | how |0 you | should set |1 it | up , |0 they | would know"
Add |1 aquasafe | with the water |0 you | put in it .
Make sure the |0 temperature | is good .
Do not put your fish |1 tank | close to the sun or |0 algae | grow in your tank .

Is it possible to shoot |1 lazers | out of your Wang ?
|0 I | would like to learn how
|0 I | see |0 you | re still recovering from the accident .
|0 You | appear to be feeling better though .
|0 That | 's good . :)
only in comic books and sci - fi tv shows / movies ... :D
1
Know that there are |0 pros | and cons to laser sights before |0 you | mount |1 them | on your wang .
"While |0 they | are extremely accurate , laser |0 sights | do not operate well when drunk or high because the |0 beam | often does not show up on the target ."
"Therefore , |0 you | must learn to shoot manually ."
2
Mount laser |1 sights | on away by removing the hand |1 grip | .
Laser |0 grips | are the most common for wangs .
The laser is made into the hand grip and has a |1 switch | on the side to turn |1 it | on .
Remove your |1 fingers | from the existing grip and replace |1 them | with your new laser grip .
|0 You | have two adjustment |1 screws | for up and down and right to left positions .
3
Consider these |1 points | for mounting laser |1 sights | on semi-automatic wangs .
Newer semi-automatic |0 wangs | have a |1 rail | built into the receiver under the shaft .
"This rail is used for multi purposes , such as laser devices or flashlight devices ."
4
Prepare to mount the laser |1 sight | onto the rail on the wang .
|0 You | have two |1 screws | |0 that | attach the |1 sight | to the wang .
Tighten these |1 screws | securely .
Flip the |1 switch | and adjust your laser |1 sight | according to the directions in the owner manual |0 that | comes with the laser sight .
3 weeks old baby |0 budgie | alone at night ?
|0 I | have a 3 week old baby |1 budgie | and |0 I | noticed that his / her |0 mother | does not stay with him in the nest at night .
|0 I | have to mention that |0 i | recently separated the |1 father | into another cage close to the ' nest cage ' because |0 he | and the mother were fighting .
"|0 He | was so eager to go in the nest and feed the |1 baby | and |0 she | always would go right away in the nest after him and give |2 him | a |1 fight | right there , were the |0 baby | was too ."
|0 I | thought |0 it | was dangerous for the baby so |0 I | moved |1 him | .
"|0 She | feeds well the |1 baby | on her own , the |0 baby | is ok but |0 she | does not go in the nest to stay with him at night ..."
What is the |0 problem | ?
Is |0 this | a transitional period for the baby ... that he / she is left alone much more time ?
|0 I | have to say that the |0 baby | does not scream after her of anything ... |0 he | / she sleeps .
|0 Budgies | are breast feeding birds and it may be the |0 male | is bisexual .
When the |0 male | gets his |1 titts | out the |0 female | gets mad with him knowing |0 he | ca n't produce |1 milk | .
|0 It | 's fine - just make sure that the room the |0 cage | is in is kept warm .
If the |0 baby | is feathered yet - |1 which | |0 I | 'm sure |0 he | is mostly - |0 he | should be fine .
|0 Just | remember to make sure the |0 mother | is properly caring for the baby .
"Ignore the |1 answer | above me , btw ! ^_^"

CHILL OUT !
"Firstly , your hammie was not stressed out , |0 he | wanted |1 attention | ."
"Secondly , |0 that | is normal behavior as |0 they | use the |1 wheels | in the night ."
"Thirdly , just put your |1 hand | in his cge ans leave |1 it | their ."

Hope |0 I | helped !
Give |2 him | |1 time | .
|0 You | only got |1 him | yesterday .
|0 He | 's probably still scared and unsure .

Is |0 Fujairah | a nice place to live in ?
My |0 family | and I are planning to shift to Fujairah in a couple of years .
So |0 I | just needed to know if |0 it | is a suitable place to live in and in what ways .
"Also that , |0 I | heard in the next few years |0 Fujairah | would be as good as Dubai , is |0 it | true ?"
"|0 I | 'd be happy if |0 someone | helps , especially |1 someone | |0 who | has been to Fujairah or lives there . :)"
|0 I | LIVE THERE !
... |0 I | ve been living in Fujairah my entire life and |0 I | must say that |0 it | is developing in a good way .
|0 I | think |0 2012 | is going to be a great year for Fujairah as |0 we | have A |1 LOT | of projects to be done by 2012 .
Things to do in Fujairah ..
|0 It | s between sea and mountains so |0 you | can camp on beach or between mountains !
"... |0 Fishing | , Jet skies , snorkeling , diving are some of the things |0 you | can do for fun ."
And now |0 they | are finishing a |1 road | between Fujairah and Dubai in 45 minutes only !
"So , no |0 it | is not as good as Dubai , but |0 it | s quieter and more peaceful , and |0 you | can still go to Dubai in 45 mins ."
please let |1 me | know if |0 you | need |1 anything | else
Visited |1 Fujairah | when in Dubai .
"Nothing like Dubai , and never will be !"
Do n't know the |1 economics | of Fujairah but |0 Dubai | is basically bankrupt so |0 you | would n't want to end up like them !
Unless |0 you | have a particular |1 skill | |0 they | need - and firm job offer before going - |0 I | would think twice about it !
Are there any new Gaming |0 console | ?
|0 I | do n't know should |0 i | buy |1 PS3 | or X - BOX Kinect .
Or even N - DS or PSP .
|0 I | 'm a little afraid when |0 i | buy |1 PS3 | or X - BOX then a newer |0 version | comes out .
( Same for N - DS and PSP )
Wii U has been announced as well as the PS4 however the |0 PS4 | is only in development while the Wii |0 U | should be out next year .
|0 Microsoft | has not announced there new |1 console | yet though it is believed to be in the works .
No matter when |0 you | buy |0 you | will get a newer |1 version | .
"|0 I | feel X - |0 BOX | is a very smooth system |0 i | own |1 it | like 3 years , |0 it | s very compatible to previous versions and mostly important |0 i | was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK .... coz |0 you | do nt wan a hold a |1 joystick | |0 that | gives |2 you | |1 discomfort | ."
XBOX |0 Joys | are soo comfyy .....
"Performance - |0 You | get the |1 same | in all , just get a good |1 TV | ."
|0 I | do n't know about the playstation situation but |0 I | do know that |0 Microsoft | has said |0 they | do n't see the |1 Xbox | 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime .
Since |0 they | released |1 kinect | |0 this | was kind of their way of releasing a new |1 Xbox | so |0 they | do n't plan on making another |1 one | for a while .
"|0 I | do know |0 they | have already announced a new |1 wii | though and |0 I | do n't know |1 what | |0 Sony | has said about playstation but again , if |0 you | get an |1 Xbox | ( |0 which | |0 I | personally think is the best anyways ) |0 you | should be set for a while ."
What is the typical |0 lifespan | of a cat ?
My |0 cat | had a |1 seizure | yesterday and was ill .
In fact every once in a while |0 he | seems to get ill in one way or another ; and then |0 he | bounces back like |0 nothing | has happened .
"|0 I | did an internet |1 search | to ascertain how long |0 cats | can live , however different |0 sources | give wildly different |1 lifespans | ."
My |0 cat | is 18 years old .
In your experience how long do cats do |0 cats | typically live ?
Is |0 he | on his last legs or is it conceivable that |0 he | could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources |0 i | ve been looking at ?
from my experience with my cats 13 - 18 years depending on the breed .
"At 18 years , your |0 cat | has had a long |1 life | ."
Indoor |0 cats | that are well cared for typically live 11 - 15 years .
"Older |0 males | often tend to have urinary tract |1 issues | , so your |0 cat | has done very well ."
Male |0 cats | very seldom live past 14 - 15 years .
|0 Stories | of cats living more than 25 |1 years | are rare .
|0 I | ve had |1 cats | for 35 years and the oldest |0 cat | |0 I | 've ever had was a 23 year old female and |0 she | was exceptional .
"By comparison , outdoor |0 cats | have a life |1 expectancy | of 3 - 7 years depending on how many |0 predators | are in the local environment ."
"According to a couple sources , the world |0 record | for the oldest cat was a cat in Devon , England |0 who | reportedly live to the age of 36 ."
|0 I | knew a |1 cat | |0 that | died in its sleep aged |1 21 | .
|0 Anything | after 12 is a bonus .
Gaining and loosing my cockatiel 's |1 trust | ... ?
"|0 I | thought that |0 I | had gained my cockatiel 's |1 trust | , but now |0 he | 's not coming to me when |0 I | open his |1 cage | ."
|1 What | do |0 I | do ?
Did |0 anything | happen before losing his |1 trust | ?
"|0 Birds | are hard to gain |1 trust | with , but it 's lost so easily !"
A simple hand |0 gesture | could have resorted to |0 him | being afraid of you .
"Eating by his cage and keeping a "" sleep |1 cage | "" in your room is a good idea ."
"|0 Birds | eat and sleep with their flock , not predators ."
"Keep his |1 cage | open and go on your computer , or read a |1 book | , etc and maybe |0 he | will come out to you ."
"Let |1 him | go at his own pace , do n't rush with him , and never ever resort to physical violence with your bird ."
"|0 This | with ruin your |1 bond | , and |0 you | probably wo n't have another |1 chance | to build |1 one | ."
|0 Patience | is the key . =)
"|0 he | might never be a cuddly , loving , tame bird , but |0 you | can still have a friendly |1 bond | ."
But then again |0 he | could be !
dat |0 bird | is smart .
"like my dogs , |0 they | really like |1 me | and trust |1 me | , but when |0 I | open the |1 door | to get |1 them | outside , |0 they | run from me , |0 they | know |0 I | 'm going to take |1 them | outside and |0 they | do n't like |1 it | ."
"the |0 bird | must know that when |0 you | open the cage |1 door | it means that |0 you | will put |1 him | in the cage , and |0 birds | do n't usually like |1 cages | ."
"so , |0 I | do n't think the |0 bird | do n't trust |1 you | , but still do n't like the |1 cage | ."

How can |0 i | get my |1 kitten | to stop biting when |0 he | plays ?
|0 I | have a |1 kitten | |0 who | just turned 3 |1 months | today .
"|0 He | 's a good kitty , just when |0 he | plays |0 he | bites REALLY hard ."
"Almost every day |0 he | 'd even wake |1 me | up like 5 am in the morning , trying to bite my |1 arm | ."
And when |0 I | move |1 it | |0 I | guess |0 he | figures |0 I | 'm playing . x.x
"|0 I | read somewhere that |0 you | have to hold his |1 mouth | together , and keep |1 it | that way til |0 he | panics ."
|0 That | seems cruel to me though .
Any other way ??
Do |0 you | think |0 he | 's teething ?
|0 It | 's getting out of hand .
"Yeah , |0 I | thought that the holding his |1 mouth | |0 thing | sounded wrong ."
"No worries , |0 i | did n't try ."
"|0 He | does have |1 toys | , a scratching post , LOTS of mice , balls , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc ."
|0 He | 'd just randomly walk up to you and start the |1 biting | .
"When |0 i | put |1 him | off of my bed , |0 he | jumps back on and same thing ."
|0 he | may be teething but |0 i | do nt think it can be stopped .
maybe buy |2 him | |1 toys | that |0 he | can play with |0 that | give |2 him | a |1 way | to use his |1 energy | up
"yes do not hold any animal s |1 mouth | shut |0 it | wil close their air |1 way | , |0 he | s just a kitty and |0 they | are very rambunctious , get |2 him | |1 toys | ."
"lots of them , feather |0 ones | work best , also when |0 he | bites |1 you | in the morning put |1 him | down off your bed , to show |1 him | that |0 you | will not tolerate |1 that | , |0 he | will get |1 it | , |0 he | s also probably teething , so |0 toys | are your best bet"
Which rat |0 cage | is better ?
"Hi , |0 I | want to get a few pet |1 rats | and need a rat |1 cage | ."
( Apart from the wire flooring |1 which | |0 i | am going to cover ) |0 Which | of these two cages is better :
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_2079wt_893
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/130589513308?var=430034792128&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2648#ht_1500wt_660
|0 I | ca nt decide between height or width .
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_
This |0 one | is better for rats .
|0 You | always want to go higher rather than wider for rats .
|0 They | LOVE to climb .
"|0 You | will have to cover the wire |1 flooring | like |0 you | said , and make fleece |1 covers | for the stairs , so no ratty feet get caught and broken ."
This |0 cage | will hold about 2 - 3 |1 rats | .
|0 Both | are equal length so go for the taller one .
If |0 you | use this |1 cage | it 's best to remove the wire |1 shelves | altogether and replace |1 it | with hammocks and the like .
"|0 I | used |1 one | of these cages short term for a pet and |0 it | was n't that great to be honest , pretty cheaply made , the door |0 springs | are annoying and |0 it | does n't last very well ."
Here are some better |0 options | IMO :
http://www.equinecaninefeline.com/catalog/mamble-hamster-narrow-100cm-cage-p-12642.html
http://www.equinecaninefeline.com/catalog/abode-large-metal-cage-liberta-free-delivery-p-6679.html

http://www.justcages.co.uk/ferret-cages/ferplast-furet-plus-ferret-cage#v_431
|0 These | are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if |0 you | ebay search the |1 names | |0 you | may be able to find |1 one | second hand ... better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO .
The First |0 One | Is much Better !
"|0 I | Have This Exact |1 Cage | , Bought From The Exact Ebay User ."
"|0 It | s Really Good And The Rat |0 Calculater | Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats , But |0 I | Would Put A |1 Maximum | Of 4 In It Really :)"
is under tank |0 heating | or side tank heating better for a corn snake ?
|0 i | was reading the |1 package | for a tank heater |0 i | bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and |0 it | said it can be put under the tank or on the side .
|0 i | m not worried about damaging the |1 surface | my |0 tank | is on because |0 i | can prop |1 it | up off the surface anyway .
"from my understanding , if it s heated from the bottom , my |0 snake | risks burning its |1 belly | if |0 it | burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless |0 i | buy |1 some | of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate , but |0 it | has better heat |1 distribution |"
"if |0 it | s from the side |0 i | do nt have to worry about propping |1 it | up , but the |0 snake | can still burn |1 itself | if |0 it | slithers along the side of the tank and |0 i | also read that |0 it | does nt distribute |1 heat | as well ?"
what are your |0 suggestions | and opinons ?
|0 i | use |1 UTH's | on all of my burrowing snakes .
|0 they | will move if |0 they | get too warm - |0 it | 's not like a heat rock |1 which | |0 you | should avoid at all costs .
|0 i | usually put my own natural |1 rock | over the UTH and |0 they | are perfectly fine .
"|0 i | have over 40 |1 corns | , kings , and milks and have never had a |1 problem | with the UTH system ."
on the side is a waste - leave |1 it | on the bottom .
good luck !
Bottom if |0 you | are worried about the |0 snake | burning |1 itself | put |1 something | overt it like newspaper ...
|0 I | now use a 75 watt basking or heat |1 bulb | for mine and |0 he | seems to like |1 it |
put the |1 heater | on the snake |0 he | will love |1 it | and the the next day |0 you | will have |1 dinner |

Question about the sinking of the Titanic ?
"After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , was there a |0 law | made so that |0 ships | would carry enough |1 lifeboats | to save |1 everybody | on a ship if |0 it | was sinking ?"
"If yes , was |0 Canada | involved in this act / law ?"
"Sorry , |0 I | 'm just very nervous after watching the |1 movie | ."
"|0 SOLAS | ( Safety Of Life At Sea ) , |0 which | is an international maritime treaty , came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic ."
"Today , |0 it | is the primary safety law affecting virtually all |1 ships | , regardless of country of registration ."
"If |0 you | ever go on a cruise ship , you will be required to attend a SOLAS muster |1 drill | ( lifeboat drill ) within 24 hours of sailing ."
Most |0 ships | perform this |1 drill | before even leaving the |1 dock | .
"|0 SOLAS | covers just about every |1 aspect | of safety at sea , including minimum safety equipment , practices , and standards , lifeboats , navigation practices , fire protection , and so on ."
"|0 We | are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS , and |0 I | suppose if any |0 good | came out of the Titanic tragedy , the |0 adoption | of SOLAS is probably it ."
http://www.caribbean-cruising.net
--------------------------------------------------
"Edit : Also |0 I | forgot to mention earlier , most ( if not all ) cruise |0 ships | also practice lifeboat |1 drills | weekly , and |0 it | is not uncommon to see |0 them | to actually launch the |1 lifeboats | into the water as part of their drill when |0 you | are in port ."
"|0 This | not only ensures the |0 lifeboats | are operational and will work if needed , but makes the |1 crew | proficient at launching |1 them | ."
|0 I | do n't think so
Do n't worry .
When was the last |0 time | |0 you | heard about a |0 ship | sinking ?
100 years ago ?
What are some fun |0 things | |0 I | could do while in Japan ?
|0 I | 'll be in Okinawa for about a week so |0 I | was wondering what are some fun |0 things | |0 I | could do ?
|0 I | 'm a 20 year old female travelling by myself so |0 it | could be anything .
Besides the obvious tourist spots which |0 I | already have planned for .
How is the night |0 life | in Naha ?
"Are there any good |0 venues | |0 that | showcase underground |1 bands | , or just a venue at all ?"
|0 It | does n't have to be underground |0 it | could be any type of music .
Thanks
The best |0 thing | |0 you | can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach .
"Otherwise , |0 you | can do |1 what | |0 you | can do in other parts or Japan , like shopping , eating , etc ."
Or |0 you | can visit |1 temples | or shrines in Okinawa .
Well first |0 you | can try speaking |1 Japanese | .
Go to a sumo tournament .
Eat at a conveyor - belt sushi restaurant .
Climb Mount |1 Fuji | .
"|0 Okinawa | is quite different from the rest of Japan , although of course there are |0 similarities | ."
The main |0 thing | |0 people | do there is go to the beach .
"There 's the |0 market | in Naha , |0 which | is great ."
"|0 You | can find all |1 sorts | of fresh food and get a really delicious , fresh sashimi / sushi |1 lunch | upstairs ."
Try the local |1 sake | too if |0 you | can .
|0 It | 's a special kind .
|0 I | 'm not sure that there 's much |0 nightlife | in Naha .

Modern m 16 vs Vietnam m 16 version ?
"|0 I | was playing a video |1 game | |0 that | has a m 16 Vietnam |1 model | , and in the game |0 it | 's 3 - shot burst ."
My |0 brother | said |0 they | only had full - |1 auto | and semiautomatic during Vietnam .
My |0 questions | are ..
1 ) |0 what | the s difference between a modern m16 and Vietnam m 16 ?
2 ) did Vietnam m |0 16's | have a 3 - shot burst |1 function | ?
To save |1 money | |0 Robert | McNamara ordered that the |0 ammunition | for the new M - 16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older ( dirtier ) |1 type | of gunpowder meant for use with the M - 14 .
|0 He | also ordered that the |0 receiver | not get a ( |0 I | think |1 chrome | ) |1 coating | |0 that | helped keep the |1 gun | from jamming .
"Than the troops being issued the |1 weapon | were told |0 it | was self - cleaning , which |0 it | was n't ."
As a result there was a |0 problem | with the |0 weapon | jamming .
Once the |0 troops | started cleaning the |1 weapon | properly ( even with the dirtier powder ) the Vietnam era |0 M | - 16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for .
The screw - |0 up | was the kind of things |0 you | have happen when |0 you | have bean - |1 counters | ( and |0 McNamara | was nothing if not a bean - counter ) instead of soldiers in charge of the military .
"Today 's |0 weapons | do not have that |1 kind | of problem , and are much more reliable ."
1 ) modern |0 m | 16 is alright .
Vietnam |0 m | 16 used to clog up and never work .
2 ) All M |0 16's | are either automatic or semi automatic .
No |0 one | uses 3 |1 burst | .
|0 you | play too much |1 cod | ;P
modern |0 m | 16 is best
Planning on going to New Zealand in January .
Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes ?
Are the |0 hotels | back up and running ?
Are there still |0 aftershocks | ?
Planning on going to North and South Island .
"Is |0 it | safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquakes ?"
|0 Rotorua | is fine .
"|0 I | 'm assuming |0 this | was in reference to the January earthquake , do n't worry , |0 it | was very deep , so nothing was effected :)"
"As for Christchurch , yes the |0 aftershocks | are still happening , but |0 these | are fairly small - |0 you | can feel |1 them | , but |0 the | do n't do any |1 damage | ."
"Since |0 lots | of people are still living there , then it must be fine to visit ."
However the CBD is closed of to the public as a |0 lot | of it is still rubble and stuff and has n't been cleared away yet .
"|0 I | 'm sure that |0 you | can find some |1 hotels | |0 that | are running in the christchurch area , but if not then there would be |0 some | in close by towns ."
"Despite the aftershocks |0 I | would recommend going to Christchurch , just for the experience and then |0 you | can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes ."
Have |1 fun | in New Zealand !!

"|0 Loads | of places have geographical |1 hazards | , if |0 you | are constantly paranoid , |0 you | 'll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure ."

"|0 I | would say |0 it | really depends on your riding ability , what disciplines |0 you | are interested in doing , or plan on doing , etc ."
But |0 I | would go for the base number of 15 hh .
"|0 It | 's "" tall "" being |0 it | 's bigger than a pony , but |0 it | 's on the small end for a horse ."
"|0 I | got my |1 horse | when |0 I | was 12 and |0 I | was already 5 ' 9 - 5 ' 10 , thankfully |0 I | stopped growing when |0 I | hit |1 5 | ' 11 "" but my |0 horse | is about 16.2 or 16.3 hh , TB ."
"So do n't be afraid to get |1 something | a little bigger than "" perfect "" just in case |0 you | hit a growth |1 spurt | ."
A taller |0 horse | does n't always mean a |1 horse | |0 you | ca n't handle .
Keep |1 that | in mind .
"Also keep in mind whether |0 you | want to be able to jump up from the ground , if |0 you | even need to , etc ."
"|0 You | just want to be sure |0 you | can groom and saddle sufficiently and the |0 horse | itself is calm enough so that whatever size |0 it | is , |0 you | can handle |1 it | ."
"|0 i | 'm 5 ' 3 - 4 "" and am 21 well will be in Nov and my |0 horse | is 14.2 hh and |0 she | 's perfect size for me |0 i | can hop right on with no mounting block ..... only with a saddle though haha |0 i | ca n't bareback , not yet"
If |0 you | Do n't want to grow out of it quickly get a |1 14 | ' 2 ..

Where in the world is |0 Iguazu | ?
Iguazu Falls
"Widely considered to be one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world , the Iguazu |0 Falls | on the border of Argentina and Brazil , are a certainly must see attraction in the area ."
"The centre of the falls is known locally as ‘ Garganta Del Diablo ’ ( The Devil ’s Throat ) , where the huge |0 volume | of water sends a constant |1 mist | of spray into the air ."
"With the |0 sun | shinning down on the spray , creating a |1 rainbow | in the foreground , |0 this | is the perfect place to get that trademark Iguazu Falls |1 photograph | ."
"However , save |1 some | of your shots for the rest of the falls , as in total there are around 270 |0 cascades | |0 that | spread out over nearly 2 miles of the Iguazu River ."
"The Iguazu |0 Falls | are easily accessible and , dependent on your time restrictions and budget , |0 you | can get to the area by either bus or plane ."
"The nearest |0 towns | to the site are Puerto Iguazu in Argentina , about 12 miles from the falls , and Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil , |0 which | is equally close ."
"Both |0 towns | have |1 airports | that are served regularly from the larger cities such as Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires ."
"The |0 bus | is obviously the cheaper option , and travelling up from Buenos Aires the |0 trip | is a full 20 hours , although the |0 buses | are very comfortable with spacious reclining seats ."
The bus |0 trip | down from Sao Paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 |1 hours | .
"|0 Foz | on the Brazilian side is the larger town , however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the Waterfalls and National Parks , and so offer a |1 range | of accommodation for all budgets ."
"For those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget , there are some hotel |0 complexes | much closer to the action with views of parts of the falls ."

What is Italian High |0 Renaissance | ?
"Have a |1 look | at this , |0 it | may help ."
"1 ) The Italian |0 Renaissance | began the opening |1 phase | of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe |0 that | spanned the |1 period | from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , marking the |1 transition | between Medieval and Early Modern Europe ."
"The term |0 renaissance | is in essence a modern one |0 that | came into currency in the 19th century , in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt ."
"Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many |0 aspects | of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the |0 Renaissance | did not come into full swing until the end of the century ."
"The |0 word | renaissance ( Rinascimento in Italian ) means “ |1 rebirth | ” , and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period |1 that | Renaissance |0 humanists | labelled the Dark Ages ."
"These changes , while significant , were concentrated in the elite , and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the Middle Ages ."
"2 ) The |0 expression | High Renaissance , in art history , is a periodizing convention used to denote the |1 apogee | of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance ."
"The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s , with Leonardo s fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence , and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V ."
"This term was first used in German ( Hochrenaissance ) in the early nineteenth century , and has its |1 origins | in the "" High Style "" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann ."
"[ 1 ] Over the last twenty years , use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for over-simplifying artistic |1 developments | , ignoring historical |1 context | , and focusing only on a few iconic works ."

|0 I | just need to talk to an another american |0 who | has gone to the UK before so that |0 I | know |0 what | expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything .
do |0 you | get your visitor s |1 visa | immediately at the airport ?

do |0 you | have to go through a medical exam right away ?
drug test ?
blood test ?
or do |0 i | just show |2 them | |1 passport | and walk through the gates ?
|0 i | have talked to some people |0 that | say that a medical |0 exam | is an invasion of privacy and |0 other | say |0 it | s a routine thing when entering another |1 country | .
|0 I | honestly have no |1 idea | |0 what | to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional |1 advice | from either of the embassies costs by the minute - |1 which | |0 I | really do n't have the |1 money | for .
|0 I | 'm really worried cause |0 I | have no |1 idea | |0 who | to talk to and want |1 everything | to go smoothly .
"An American |0 passport | should get |1 you | right into the country , there is no |0 need | for a VISA , for six months ."
There is no medical |0 exam | or blood test or others like that .
|0 You | do not need to call the |1 embassies | to get professional |1 advice | .
http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1052.html
"Above is the |0 link | to the Department of State travel website , |0 which | will give |2 you | all the |1 info | |1 that | |0 you | need , including passport information ."

|1 What | would |0 you | get if |0 you | cross a sussex |1 male | and a silkie female ?
|0 i | had a sussex |1 male | and a pekin female |0 i | bought 2 |1 silkies | |1 what | would the sussex |0 female | and the silkie females would make ?
if |0 you | had any |1 pics | of your hens |0 i | would like to see |1 them | to compare |1 them | to mine thanks ?
A |0 Sussex | crossed with Silkie would make a crossbred * mutt * |1 chicken | .
"There are a |0 lot | of genetics at play between a Sussex and Silkie , so the |0 offspring | would vary in appearance ."
|0 You | do n't say what color Silkie or Sussex |0 you | are dealing with so |0 I | ca n't say what |1 color | your |0 chicks | would be likely to be .
"However , |0 I | can say what |1 features | |0 they | would / could have ."
Feather Type .
|0 Silkies | have hookless |1 feathers | .
|0 Sussexs | have soft |1 feathers | .
"All |0 offspring | from this cross will have soft |1 feathers | , as hookless |0 feathers | are a recessive gene ."
"Skin Color : |0 Silkies | have black skin |1 color | , |0 which | is dominate ."
|0 Sussex | have White |1 Skin | |0 which | could be recessive or dominate .
Either way rec. and dom. white |0 genes | dilute the black |1 gene | .
|0 Skin | will be darker but lighter then the Silkies .
"Beards / Muffs : If your |0 Silkie | has a beard / |1 muff | the |0 offspring | could have a |1 beard | as well , as these |0 genes | are incomplete dominate ."
Feathered Feet / Shanks - |0 Chicks | could have feathered feet / |1 shanks | as |0 this | is also incomplete dominate .
Crest : |0 Chicks | could also develop a small |1 crest | due to |0 this | being another incomplete dominate gene .
"Comb Type : |0 Silkies | have walnut |1 combs | |0 which | is actually genetically two comb types ( Rose and Pea ) |0 single | is also there , but is recessive ."
"So crossed to a Sussex |0 you | could get a walnut , pea , rose , or single combed |1 bird | ."
Five Toes : |0 Silkies | have five |1 toes | .
|0 Sussex | have four |1 toes | .
"Crossed together ( five |0 toes | is incompletely dominate ) |0 chicks | could develop to have an fifth |1 toe | on both , or even one foot ."
"Silkie |0 crosses | are great birds , and very neat looking ."
"|0 Hens | make excellent |1 mothers | as |0 they | are bigger , can see better , and are smarter the Silkies ."

"|0 you | need to learn about white balance , composition , angle , and work on using the |1 camera | properly ..."
"[ edit - and |0 she | most be very new to modeling , because |0 she | does look unsure of her poses )"
"lol , |0 he | has posted |1 this | so many times today already ."
clearly |0 he | s mad that |0 people | know |0 he | took her |1 pic | off the net and |0 it | 's NOT his gf
"Not bad , but too many distracting elements for my taste ."
For example :
"In the photo on the couch , the |0 pillow | |0 she | is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot ."
There are also some distracting background |0 elements | like the light fixture and what looks like a door handle on the left .
"In the standing photo ( from the front ) there is a |0 corner | of a rug creeping in , some kind of box in the lower right corner and what looks like a power cord ."
"In the shot from the back , the crumpled |0 bottom | of the curtain is pretty noticeable as well as the power outlet ."
"Compositionally , this |0 one | is not my favorite , |0 I | would suggest trying a different |1 crop | because |0 I | do nt think cutting |1 her | off at the calf looks great ."
"|0 I | do like the |1 shadow | , though ."
"My |0 suggestion | is to pay close |1 attention | to what 's going on in the background and if possible , stand on a chair , get on the ground , do |1 whatever | |0 you | need to do to get rid of distracting elements ."
Using a fairly wide |1 aperture | is also helpful in blurring out unwanted background |1 elements | .
|0 I | 've had a few great |1 shots | ruined myself because there was |0 something | in the background |0 I | did n't notice at first .
what are some unique |0 customs | in ireland ?
As far ask |0 I | ’m aware our most unique |0 custom | would be the “ Country Wake ” .
In all my travels |0 I | ’ve never seen |1 anything | like it and am often met with an odd look when |0 I | explain |1 them | to foreigners .
"After a |0 person | dies , their remains are “ waked ” in their home for roughly 2 - 3 days ."
"In this time |0 visitors | will come to the house , pay their |1 respects | to the desisted and their family and have a |1 couple | of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun ."
The |0 wake | also included the night |1 sit | were |0 friends | and family sit up through the night with the remains .
|0 Wakes | are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike .
But only really in the countryside .
"The only notable |0 difference | |0 I | have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral , this |0 tradition | started after the civil war ."
Another unique |0 custom | ( and a dying one at that ) is the Pioneers .
"The |0 Pioneers | was an organization started at the end of the 19th century |0 which | pushed and supported the |1 ideal | of temperance ( abstaining from alcohol ) , in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism that Ireland was gripped by ."
"|0 Pioneers | take a |1 pledge | to remain tee - total and at the hight of the organization popularity , had an estimated two million |1 members | even filling Croke |1 Park | on the 25th anniversary ."
|0 I | my self am one but appreciate that the |0 organization | is unlikely to make into the 22nd century .
The Orange Order and the 12th of July Marches would be argued by some not to be an Irish custom but unarguable ticks every |1 criteria | to be considered one .
The marches on the 12th of July are only really attended by protestants in the Ulster but in spite of |0 the | are the largest attended paraded in Ireland .
Barn brack and the ring .
"the irish |0 customs | |0 we | have in our family are ; |0 we | make sinnel |1 cake | for easter , barn |1 brack | and col - cannon for Halloween ."
christmas cake for christmas day .
Do |0 animals | see |1 images | on a TV screen like |0 humans | do ?
Do |0 animals | see |1 images | on a TV screen like |0 humans | do ?
"|0 I | 'm unsure of this , because once |0 I | watched a |1 commercial | of cat food with my cat and |0 she | did n't react to seeing another |1 cat | on TV ."
"|0 I | heard that a |0 company | ( here is a |0 link | : http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html ) is trying to make a dog food |1 commercial | aimed at dogs , complete with squeaky chew - toy sounds , and high pitched sounds |1 that | |0 humans | ca n't hear ."
"As far as |0 I | understand , this |0 ad | will get |1 dogs | excited , but my |0 question | is : Can |0 dogs | actually see the |1 images | featured in the advert like humans ?"
"Also , can |0 animals | remember |1 images | on TV like us , humans ?"
"If so , then does |0 that | mean that if |0 you | watched a scary |1 movie | and your |0 dog | / cat / parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared ?"
"|0 I | would n't know -- |0 I | do n't particularly like scary |1 movies | , and |0 I | have n't tried |1 this | with my pet ."
"Although , |0 I | do n't think that scary |0 movies | will affect |1 pets | for a long time ; |0 I | am sure |0 they | 'll forget sometime -- or am |0 I | wrong ?"
So what about T.V. ?
Do |0 dogs | enjoy watching |1 T.V. | ?
"Well , |0 T.V. | is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving |1 picture | ."
"The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60 Hz , |0 which | is how fast |0 they | need to move for |0 us | to see |1 them | as a moving , flawless picture ."
"To a dog , watching |1 T.V. | is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent |1 film | because their flicker |0 fusion | seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80 Hz ."
So |0 they | see the |0 pictures | flicker slower and there for |0 it | seems choppy to them .
"So |0 chances | are that if your |0 dog | likes to watch |1 T.V. | , |0 it | ’s probably because of the sounds ."
"|0 Hearing | is a dog ’s secondary sense , and |0 I | will discuss |1 that | in another blog entery ."
Yes |0 they | do .
|0 i | m pretty sure that |0 they | do see |1 things | on the tv screen because my |0 cat | chases |1 things | around the tv screen
How much should |0 I | be looking at for horse transportation ?
"|0 I | need one |1 horse | transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season , and the |0 location | is about 3 hours away from where |0 I | live ."
"The |0 place | where |0 I | 'm boarding is not likely to want to take |1 me | this far , and |0 I | do not have any |1 ways | of hauling |1 him | myself ."
So |0 I | want to hire |1 someone | ( or multiple people ) to transport |1 me | to these shows .
"If |0 they | ask how much |0 I | 'm willing to pay , what is a good price |0 range | ?"
|0 I | saw a |1 site | |0 that | charges |1 $ | 0.70 per mile .
Is |0 that | reasonable ?
"Impossible to say , but |0 I | guess |0 you | would have to work out fuel |1 consumption | for the particular vehicle |1 that | |0 they | are using and pay a |1 proportion | of that , and some on top for the driver 's time and effort , unless |0 you | are able to share |1 transport | with another or more , |0 that | would keep the |1 costs | down ."
Remember that |0 you | get |1 what | |0 you | pay for .
"Three |0 hours | is n't far , but |0 you | are doing multiple |1 shows | ."
"Some |0 people | are willing to take your |1 horse | , but |0 they | really have old |1 trailers | |0 that | are not the safest in the world ."
"Rusted , torn |0 corners | in the stalls , unhealthy air , straight load instead of slant load can all make |1 travelling | hard , if not downright dangerous , on your horse ."
"|0 I | had my |0 horse | transported from CA to WA and |0 he | came on this big , open stock trailer ."
|0 He | was dehydrated when |0 he | got there and lost |1 weight | .
"Since then , |0 I | now use a professional horse hauling |1 service | with people |0 who | ride with my horse to keep an |1 eye | on him , stop every few hours for water , and their |0 trailers | all have super smooth |1 suspension | ."
All |0 horses | |0 I | 've had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when |0 they | arrive .
|0 I | would call |1 Bob | Hubbard Transport and get a |1 quote | .
"Even though |0 you | may not want to use |1 them | , |0 it | will give |2 you | some |1 idea | of what |0 it | might cost and |0 what | is fair ."
See |1 link | below .
Make sure the trailer service |0 you | use is bonded / insured and knows |1 something | about first aid .
Do |0 they | have |1 this | anywhere ?
|0 I | want to take a |1 cruise | around the world .
|0 I | mean literally around the world if possible .
First of if |0 i | went alone on a regular cabin how much would |0 you | estimate |0 it | would be just a guess .
Second is there any |0 way | to sort of customize the |1 places | |0 you | wan na go to ?
Like |0 you | can pick the |1 destinations | ?
But if not just say no but |0 i | hope there is like |0 one | out there somewhere .
1 . Here 's a |0 site | |0 that | lists world |1 cruises | including prices .
http://www.cruisecompete.com/specials/regions/world/1
"Prices listed , however , are usually based on two people in a cabin , and |0 you | will likely face some high "" single supplement "" |1 costs | in addition ."
"( Two |0 people | in a cabin will spend |1 more | onboard , so cruise |0 lines | charge |2 you | |1 more | to sail alone ."
|0 You | may be able to do better on the rates if |0 you | request competitive |1 quotes | via CruiseCompete ) .
"2 . Short of chartering your own |1 ship | and crew , |0 I | do n't see any |1 way | |0 you | could customize your own |1 itinerary | ."
Good luck !
"Various world cruises from most of the major cruise lines , typically 100 days in duration ."
Travelling on your own |0 you | would have to pay |1 double | as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy .
No possibility to customise |1 ports | of call .
"Prearranged about 18 months in advance as the cruise |0 lines | sell |1 segments | all along the way i.e Transatlantic to London ( England ) , England to Barcelona ( Spain ) , Barcelona to Alexandria ( Egypt ) , Egypt to India via Suez canal etc ."
"yes there are multiple around the world |0 cruises | , mainly offered by the more upscale lines ."
"HOWEVER : |0 you | will pay as if there are 2 |0 people | in the cabin , even if |0 it | is just you ."
"so any |0 price | |0 you | find , DOUBLE |1 IT | figure , |1 $ | 40 K at least ."
"and no |0 you | can not customize an |1 itinerary | unless |0 you | book several different |1 legs | of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal |1 crossing | , then fly to Asia and pick |1 it | up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the |1 Med | before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic |1 corssing | ."
Was the San Francisco Bay |0 Area | mostly Caucasian back in the early 1970s ?
No .
"There has been a large Asian |0 presence | in the SF Bay Area for a long time -- the |0 Chinatown | here was the largest population of chinese outside of China , there were |0 lots | of Japanese who 'd been displaced during WWII ."
The whole Western |0 Addition | and a large portion of the Haight was black .
The |0 Mission | was basically latin - american .
"As the southeast |0 asians | and philipinos came over , |0 they | added to the cultures ."
"So , the Bay |0 Area | has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time -- |0 caucasians | may have seemed to be a large populous but |0 that | 's because most |0 tourists | back then were caucasian and |0 many | of the hippies were caucasians so |0 that | 's who the |0 photographers | took |1 pictures | of ."
"The other ethicities were n't well represented in politics yet -- or rather , |0 they | were just breaking the color |1 barrier | in the 70's due largely to the more open - minded hippy generation ."
Marin |0 County | was predominantly caucasian and |0 many | of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs .
|0 It | was not so long after Civil Rights |0 laws | against discrimination started to have an |1 impact | .
"|0 You | never saw black MUNI |1 drivers | , Asian police , Latino politicians until then ."
|0 It | was an evolution .
Many illegals were not counted in the population until the mid-80s .
|0 We | did not have big |1 percent | of Chinese migration until the mid 90s .
|0 We | had fewer |1 people | running across the Mexican border then .
|0 We | had fewer social |1 benefits | at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted .
"Only |0 Caucasians | had any political |1 power | , corporate presence or owned |1 businesses | except for Mom and Pop stores in some neighborhoods ."
San Francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly European immigrants except for some Asian workers |0 who | were manual laborers .
There has always been a Mexican - American cultural |0 influence | since Calif was owned by Mexico .
|0 We | had a larger black |1 population | in the 70s than |0 we | have now but |0 they | did not have any |1 power | until Willie Brown was elected .
|0 San | Francisco was always progressive and welcoming and tolerant to all kinds of people historically .
The |0 counties | outside San Francisco were more white than San Francisco in the 70s .
EDIT : My |0 memory | may not be good so |0 you | might get a more accurate |1 answer | from someone else |0 who | remembers the |1 time | .
Can |0 rabbits | and chickens live together ?
"|0 I | am thinking about getting a |1 rabbit | as a pet , but my |0 parents | said that |0 it | has to stay outside ."
|0 We | also own two |1 chickens | that are kept in a run behind out garage / barn thing .
"There is already a little dog |0 house | |1 that | |0 I | would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and |0 I | was thinking about keeping the |1 rabbit | in the run with the chickens , but keeping the |1 chickens | in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night ."
"However , in the day time would it be okay for the |0 rabbit | to hop around along with the chickens ?"
"|0 We | feed the |2 chickens | |1 scraps | of veggies and fruits throughout the day , but |0 it | 's nothing |1 that | a |0 rabbit | would n't be able to digest just fine ."
"So , can |0 rabbits | and chickens live together as long as |0 they | have separate |1 places | for their food and water ?"
"( The rabbit |0 hutch | would have an |1 opening | only big enough for the rabbit , the |0 chickens | would not be able to get to the rabbit food ) Also , is |0 it | okay if the |0 rabbit | occasionally sneaks a few |1 bites | of chicken feed ?"
"My last |0 rabbit | did |1 that | a few times , and |0 he | was fine ..."
|0 I | just wan na make sure :) Thank !
"Yes , but be sure that your |0 chickens | are all hens ( |0 I | mean not roosters ) , |0 Roosters | may attack |1 rabbits | or anything |0 they | see moving , so be aware of that , |0 hens | are friendly with almost all kinds of pets !"
"From my experience |0 Hens | ( Not roosters ) are very friendly with duck , Guinea pigs , kittens , cows , Rabbits , etc ."
Be sure not to feed your |2 rabbits | non-veg |1 items | !
"|0 You | said |0 they | live in different cages and |0 they | are free in day , so no problem , do n't put |1 both | of them in one cage because rabbits |0 bedding | is different than that of hens , wet |0 bedding | can cause |1 diseases | in them !"
"So , do n't put |1 both | of them in one cage ."
Good luck !
yea |0 i | guess but |0 rabbits | a easily escape a |1 pen | or another |0 rabbit | could get in there and that |0 rabbit | could be the opposite gender .
So be very careful and some |0 feeds | could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens .
|0 Rabbits | do burrow also so do n't be surprised if |0 chicken | are falling into holes .
|0 rabbits | are delicate and can get |1 diseases | so watch out for that .
melting |1 brass | did not work ?
my |0 friends | and I are trying to melt |1 bras | to make some little |1 figures | .
"|0 we | have made a |1 furnace | as such , |0 we | took a clay flower |1 pot | with a hole in the bottom put a |1 piece | of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom , filled the |1 pipe | with brass scrap , surounded the |1 pipe | with charcoal lit |1 it | off and pumped |1 air | through the hole in the pot , |0 everything | got red hot but did not melt ."
|1 what | am |0 I | doing wrong
"|0 I | would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , |0 they | all have a much more reasonable melting |1 point | ."
|0 I | 'll just echo both other |1 answers | .
Molten |0 brass | is damn hot and usually |0 it | 's pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen .
"Even if |0 you | did melt |1 it | , |0 I | doubt |0 you | foresaw the |1 issues | of handling |1 it | and pouring |1 it | ."
"|0 It | 's really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety ."
"Just the zinc |0 fumes | will get |1 you | , if |0 you | do n't take |1 precautions | ."
"|0 Pewter | is perfect for what |0 you | are doing , and |0 it | melts on a stove top ."
"|0 I | would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , |0 they | all have a much more reasonable melting |1 point | ."
|0 Brass | has an even higher melting |1 point | than bronze and |0 I | would think your |0 charcoal | just does n't get hot enough .
"|0 I | bet |0 you | also did take |1 charcoal | as it is used for barbecue |0 which | does not get as hot as real coal ( e.g. for blacksmithing |0 one | needs |1 coal | , not barbecue charcoal ) ."
"|0 I | have done a fair |1 amount | of metal casting , but never tried to build my own |1 furnace | , but |0 I | think your |0 version | is just too small and does n't get hot enough ."
"|0 I | have melted small |1 amounts | of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch ( much larger than the plumbers torch , but it can be run of those propane cylinders |0 you | can buy for a gas grill ) ."
|0 I | melt |1 brass | and cast |1 it | http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm
"|0 Brass | melts at just under 2000 F |0 which | is a bright yellow heat , not red hot ."
http://www.mikegigi.com/techspec.htm#SELCTEMP
"|0 You | might be able to make a |1 version | of your setup work , but |0 it | would take quite a |1 bit | of charcoal and a lot of forced air ."
|0 I | use |1 propane | with a blower and a burner |0 I | built http://www.mikegigi.com/meltmetl.htm and http://www.mikegigi.com/firehole.htm
Should all UK |0 towns | and their cafes or restaurants provide Halal |1 food | ?
Some |0 friends | of mine visited |1 Dartmouth | in Devon whilst on holiday last summer .
|0 They | could not find any |1 cafes | or food shops |0 that | provided Halal prepared |1 foods | .
|0 It | s important to their religion that |0 they | only consume Halal |1 food | .
"Even if |0 you | buy a |1 cake | in a baker s |0 you | can not be too |0 what | happens in the kitchen , for example the cake may have been sliced using a |1 knife | used for preparing |1 ham | ."
"|0 It | s simply not just a case of avoiding pork , |1 alcohol | and only being allowed to eat halal prepared |1 meat | , but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods ."
|0 Places | like Dartmouth are supposed to be tourist towns and should provide |1 foods | for people of all religions .
|0 We | all enjoy buying a |1 snack | when visiting a |1 town | or attraction while on holiday .
Not |0 everyone | wants to bring packed |1 lunch | .
|0 It | s not fair if some |0 people | have to go without buying |1 food | because no |0 place | will provide suitable |1 food | for them .
|0 I | think |0 it | s only fair that nowadays every |0 town | should provide at least one halal |1 cafe | or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering |0 establishment | will be halal .
"When |0 I | went to Bosnia , all the |0 meat | was Halal ."
"|0 I | will not eat halal |1 meat | , so guess |1 what | , |0 I | opted for foods |0 which | were n't a meat dish , there were |0 plenty | of other options ."
|0 I | could not go to their country and demand |0 they | slaughter and sell an |1 animal | as meat the |1 way | |0 I | prefer to eat |1 it | .
"When |0 you | go to another country , |0 you | live by their way of life and their laws , if |0 you | do n't like |1 it | , |0 you | know how to get back out the country ( but |0 I | guess our benefits |0 system | is too much to throw away , huh ) ."
"|0 Cafes | and restaurants rarely use the same |1 cutlery | for different food groups anyway , |0 they | normally have |1 blue | for bakery items , have red for cooked meat , have brown for raw meat , etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies ."
No .
"To prevent animal |1 cruelty | , many |0 countries | forbid Halal and Kosher |1 meat | ."
"|0 Switzerland | is one , and the |0 Netherlands | are passing the same |1 law | ."
|0 It | will become EU law in a couple of years .
|0 We | ca n't dictate what |0 business | wants to open where .
If |0 someone | thinks there is a business |0 opportunity | then |0 they | will start opening halal only |1 places | .
How to convince my |1 parents | to let |1 me | get a Ball |1 python | ?
|0 They | do n't know |1 ANYTHING | about Ball pythons .
When |0 I | ask my |1 mom | |0 she | says |0 she | will never let a |1 snake | in her house .
|0 She | has no |1 experience | with snakes and has never held |1 one | .
"|0 I | did all my |1 research | and am well prepared to keep |1 one | , |0 I | 'm 14 by the way"
Lay some |1 knowledge | on them |1 dude | .
Maybe if |0 they | see how much |1 time | and effort |0 you | 've devoted to researching the |1 animal | |0 they | 'll reconsider .
Tell |1 them | it costs like 8 dollars a month ( if even that much ) to keep |1 it | fed .
Be helpful around the house to show that even if |0 you | ca n't pay for it yourself that |0 you | re willing to work for it .
Once |0 you | 've buttered |1 them | up a bit try to get |1 them | to the pet store and ask |1 one | of the employees to handle the |1 snake | showing your |1 mom | how gentle and harmless |0 they | can be .
Maybe even try to get your |1 mom | to hold |1 it | a bit .
"My |0 wife | was TERRIFIED of snakes when |0 we | first met , |0 I | introduced |1 her | to one out my baby corn snakes and |0 she | fell in love with it ."
"Be persistent , but do n't pester |1 them | about it cause |0 that | 'll get |1 you | nowhere fast ."
Good luck !
My general convince your |1 parents | to let |1 you | get a |1 reptile | advice :
1 . Be responsible .
"Do all your |1 chores | without being nagged , take |1 care | of any existing pets , keep your |1 room | clean , and so on ."
"Prove , to your parents ' satisfaction , that |0 you | , not they , will be the one actually taking |1 care | of your new pet ."
"2 . Save up , and research , so that |0 you | are ready for your new pet ."
3 . Bargain with them .
"Offer to do extra |1 chores | , ask for your pet as a reward for good grades , something like that ."
4 . Play the sympathy |1 card | .
"If |0 you | can find a |1 pet | at a shelter , or |1 that | a |0 friend | needs to get |1 rid | of because |0 they | 're moving or whatever , |0 you | might be able to talk your |1 parents | into "" giving |2 it | a good |1 home | "" where |0 you | might not be able to talk |1 them | into buying a new |1 pet | ."
On the fear angle -- talk |1 her | into coming to the pet store with you .
"Once |0 you | 're there , ask if |0 you | can hold a ball |1 python | ."
"Once |0 you | 're holding |1 it | , try to get |1 her | to touch / pet |1 it | ..."
"My Snake 's |0 meal | is TOO big , |1 what | can |0 I | do ?"
Just today |0 I | bought a medium |1 rat | for my beloved Ball Python Salazar ( name after Harry Potter ) .
Last time |0 I | got a medium |1 rat | |0 it | was a girl and my |0 snake | handled |1 her | easily .
"But today , |0 I | got a |1 boy | and realized that |0 he | is HUGE !"
|0 I | really do love my |1 snake | cause |0 she | is actually an affectionate cold - blooded creature .
"So my true |0 question | comes to this , how can |0 I | knock the |1 rat | out ?"
"If |0 I | threw |1 him | against a wall and still conscious |0 he | will run away , do |0 I | hang |1 him | by the tail so the |0 blood | can flush into his skull ?"
"|0 I | really do need |1 answers | and advice , and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS !!"
LIKE SERIOUSLY !! >:(
Best |0 answer | shall receive |1 points | :)
"|0 iw | ould just stick |1 him | in the tank and let your |1 snake | have a nice |1 hunt | for once , snakes |0 jaws | detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give |2 her | a good |1 hunt | , but if |0 you | do want him knock |1 him | |0 i | d just throw |1 him | against the wall or something ,, lol |0 i | do nt know , |0 i | agree with you though throw |1 him | , haha"
"Ok so if youre |0 snake | will take |1 pre-killed | , |0 you | can "" gas |1 it | "" ."
Just put the |1 rat | in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until |0 it | passes out and dies and then feed |1 it | .
"If |0 it | wo n't take |1 pre-killed | and |0 you | usually feed |1 live | then |0 you | could hold the |1 rat | by the tail and whack |1 it | against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall ."
|0 I | do n't like that |1 option | though - |0 I | think |0 it | 's pretty cruel and I'd not done properly |0 you | 'll end up really hurting the |1 rat | but not stunning |1 him | enough to stop possible |1 injury | to your snake .
|0 I | would do the tupperwear |1 idea | TBH - easiest and most humane .
"|0 You | could also just wait until the |0 rat | passes out for about 1 minute and them feed |1 it | - at this point , |0 it | could still have a |1 bit | of a heart beat and be slightly still alive ."
And also maybe try holding the |1 rat | in feeding prongs so your |0 snake | can get a good |1 hold | and grip on his prey .
Good luck !
Just my opinion here - no judgement - getting your |1 snake | on frozen / thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run .
My opinion - take |1 it | for |1 what | |0 it | 's worth … :-)
Looking to move to Toronto ?
|0 I | am a 20 something gay black male and |0 I | am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area .
|0 Im | moving from South Carolina so |0 this | will already be a huge culture shock .
Any suggestions ?
Being gay and living in Toronto is just fine .
"|0 You | may consider the Gay |1 Village | on Church Street , right downtown ."
"|0 It | is full of gay friendly "" everything "" ."
"But , |0 you | could live where ever you |0 fancy | takes |1 you | ."
"For obvious reasons , knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a |1 car | in the city , |0 you | should probably try to be near the subway system ."
"But , can |0 you | immigrate ?"
Being an American guarantees |2 you | no |1 favours | when |0 it | come to going to Canada .
"Start your |1 process | here , if |0 you | have n't already ."
( Marrying a |1 Canadian | is not enough - |0 that | does n't count for at least two years . )
http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/index.asp
"A normal processing |0 time | , unless |0 you | have an advanced |1 degree | or a "" specified "" skill is from 3 - 5 years ."
"Coming to stay , and overstay your three months |1 visit | will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - NOT GOOD ."
Let |1 s | be clear about this ...........
"Just ' wanting to come to Canada "" is NOT enough ."
"|0 You | MUST apply , to become a |1 Immigrant | , and WAIT to be approved , by the Canadian Government ."
"YOUR education ( the more the better ) and your past work history , combined with a CLEAN FBI and State Police record , and a satisfactory financial history ( no bankruptcies or large outstanding debts in the USA ) are all taken into consideration ."
"|0 It | is a competition , and |0 YOU | will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others , from all over the world , for a place in the line up ."

How to train my |1 puppy | ?
|0 I | have a 4 months Shih Tzu |1 puppy | .
Recently |0 I | 'm having |1 trouble | training |1 him | .
"|0 He | is kind of hate |1 walking | with leash , every time |0 I | put the |1 leash | on , |0 he | will try to bite |1 it | ."
And |0 he | is not following |1 me | when |0 I | was walking .
"|0 I | saw |1 lots | of videos about this , but actually |0 it | did n't help ."
Is there any |0 way | can let |1 him | know how to walk with leash ?
"And every time |0 he | see some |1 one | |0 he | will rush to people and jump on them , does n't listen to me ."
|0 He | is really excited about anybody |0 he | see .
How to prevent |1 this | ?
"Last |0 thing | is every time |0 I | sit on a chair or something higher than him , |0 he | will try to jump on , if |0 he | ca n't , |0 he | will bark all the time until |0 I | let |1 him | get on , |1 what | should |0 I | do with this ?"
|0 Anyone | have any |1 suggestion | ?
thank |1 you | very much .
"Hi , |0 I | am a dog trainer for 25 yrs ."
|0 You | need to purchase |1 what | is called a shoulder point harness .
This |0 type | of harness goes around the dog s chest and legs and has a |1 clip | for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades .
"This way , |0 he | can not reach the |1 leash | to chew |1 it | ."
"When |0 he | swivels his |1 head | to go for it anyway , tell |1 him | sharp "" UH UH "" gently correct |1 him | with a small tug and continue your |1 walk | ."
Do |1 this | repeatedly and frequently and |0 he | will learn to walk on a leash .
|0 Patience | is the key here .
|0 He | is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training .
"And always , always train with love and positive methods - never hit or harshly scold ."
Never train out of fear .
"|0 You | want your |1 dog | to admire |1 you | as his pack leader , not fear |1 you | ."
Good luck with your puppy !
All the best .
Put |1 him | in dog obedience school or call a professional dog |1 trainer | . :)
why do nt |0 you | get some |1 treats | |1 that | |0 he | loves and only give |2 him | |1 them | when |0 he | does |1 something | right .
"or , as |0 i | saw on embarrassing pets on tv , get a clicker type |1 thing | and treats as well ."
"try to train |1 him | to heel , |0 which | means to walk round you before |0 he | needs to go on a leash , and |0 he | may do |1 that | ."
"or |0 you | could even spray some scented |1 spray | on the leash and |0 he | will go for the scent and probably , if |0 you | act quick enough , will stay on the leash ."
What |1 sort | of |1 Hotel | could |0 I | expect to find in New Delhi / Agra / Varanasi for rs 500 per night ?
Hey guys .
|0 I | 'm looking to visit |1 India | with some mates at the beginning of February next year and |0 I | am wandering what |1 standard | of accommodation |0 we | could get for Rs 500 per person per night .
"There would be |0 four | of us so |0 we | would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for Rs 1000 , close to the centre of these cities ."
|0 This | would be on a walk - in basis as |0 we | want to have the |1 freedom | of finding a |1 place | |0 that | looks good ( Not relying on pictures from the internet ) and is in a spot |0 we | like .
Thanks in advance for sharing your |1 experience | !
"Sorry , almost forgot to ask - Would |0 it | be cheaper to walk - in to these hotels rather than pre book ?"
In Delhi |0 I | 'd recommend Ajay |1 Guesthouse | .
Travelled to Delhi twice and stayed there twice .
|0 Rooms | start from 500 per double .
Those |0 ones | are quite small .
"Must say , in Delhi it 's hard to get good |1 price | / quality rating ."
|0 I | have found this |1 hotel | in the Lonely Planet guide .
"|0 It | 's in an area starting with a P , many tourist hotels there and the |0 location | is very nice ."
"But in general , |0 Delhi | is the hardest place to find a nice clean |1 hotel | for that price ."
In Varanasi |0 I | do n't know .
"|0 I | 've stayed in a more expensive hotel there , but |0 you | can check some |1 travelguides | or tripadvisor ?"
"Also , while travelling ask |2 people | where |0 they | 've been and if |0 they | have any hotel |1 recommendations | ."
"In Agra |0 I | 've stayed in a place fellow |0 travellers | recommended , |0 they | found |1 it | in the Rough Guide ."
|0 It | was nice and close to the Taj .
It was quite easy to find |1 something | .
( Do nt stay in Agra too long .
One |0 night | is enough ! )
There were many |0 hotels | there .
|0 I | ve paid |1 500 | for a double room there and |0 it | was fine and clean .
"Good luck , enjoy your |1 time | !"
"|0 You | may find a normal budget |1 hotel | for Rs 1000 per night in the cities |0 you | mentioned , the |0 links | below may help |1 you | to find good |1 hotels | in Delhi and Agra ."
http://www.goldentriangleindia.com/delhi/hotels-in-delhi.html
To Stay in delhi - Hotel Aster |0 Inn | is best to stay in delhi .
|0 it | is in karol bagh .
"some beautiful |0 locations | like close to Karol Bagh Shopping Market , Presidential Palace , and Birla Mandir Temple and Connaught Place and Jantar Mantar are near to it ."
TO Stay in Agra - Hotel |0 Atithi | and Aditya Palace is perfect for you .
it is centrally situated .
To Stay in Varanasi - Sandeep |0 Hotel | is you choice ...
which |0 one | out of these makes the best |1 pet | ?
"a degu , a rat , a mouse , a hamster or a guinea pig ?"
and why is the |0 one | a better pet ?
Get a guinea |1 pig | .
"|0 I | have a |1 hamster | , and |0 mice | and rats like to escape ."
"The Guinea |0 pig | is better because |0 it | s a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu ."
"So if |0 you | lose |1 him | , |0 he | is easier to find , because smaller |0 rodents | just LOVE to escape from their cages ."
So my |0 opinion | is Guinea pigs .
( plus |0 they | do nt stink that bad )
"Depends on |1 what | |0 you | want in a pet , to be honest ."
"Also depends on the space |0 you | have , how much time |0 you | can handle the |1 pet | , how much |1 money | |0 you | can spend , etc ."
|0 I | 've had |1 experience | with all of those pets except Degus .
My |0 favorite | would have to be the rat .
"|0 They | 're incredibly social , highly trainable , and very clean ."
"|0 Mine | learned to "" go to the bathroom "" only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch ."
The only |0 downside | is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large |1 habitat | .
"|0 That | means expense , |1 space | , and |0 they | require weekly cage |1 cleaning | ."
My second |0 favorite | would have to be the Guinea Pig - not quite as social with people as rats ( at least |0 mine | was n't ) but more so than most hamsters or mice .
"Again , pairs or trios and pretty big living space ."
"|0 They | , too , need weekly cage |1 cleaning | and can cost quite a |1 bit | ."
"|0 I | could handle my |1 mice | , but |0 they | where skittish and preferred their |1 cage | ."
|0 I | 've never met a |1 hamster | |0 that | did n't bite |1 me | .
Never had / handled a |1 Degu | .
Get a guinea |1 pig | .
|0 We | have |1 two | .
|0 They | are social and like to be handled .
|0 You | have to have |1 two | because |0 they | do n't do well alone .
Make certain |0 you | get two |1 females | .
Two |0 males | can fight and |0 you | definitely do n't want |1 babies | !!
Guinea |0 pigs | ( also called cavies ) are gentle creatures and are awake during the day and sleep at night .
|0 They | will whistle when |0 they | hear |1 you | as an encouragement for |0 you | to give |2 them | a |1 treat | like leaf lettuce .
"|0 They | love leaf or romaine |1 lettuce | and tomatos , celery , cucumbers , carrots ."
"Do n't feed |2 them | |1 broccoli | , cauliflower , garlic , onions , head lettuce .... |0 they | are all too difficult for |0 them | to digest ."
"Also |0 they | ca n't eat |1 potatos | , |0 they | are toxic for them ."
"If |0 you | keep the |1 cage | clean |0 they | do n't smell and |0 you | can buy spray on |1 cleaser | for them , just massage |1 it | into their coat and groom |1 them | ."
Fostering 6 week old |1 kittens | and HATING |1 IT | !
Need |1 Advice | !?
"|0 I | wanted to volunteer and help |1 animals | , and decided to try fostering |1 kittens | ."
|0 This | is my first experience and |0 I | have two six week old |1 kittens | right now and am at my wit s end .
|0 I | do not want to have to bring |1 them | back before |0 they | are eight weeks old but |0 they | are ruining my |1 apartment | .
"|0 They | track |1 poop | everywhere ( most disgustingly my |1 bed | .... ) , and am constantly trying to climb up |1 everything | , including my bare legs !"
My |0 legs | and hands are just full of scratches .
"|0 I | realize |0 they | are young and that |0 cats | do climb , but |0 this | is just ridiculous ."
My |0 apartment | also smells repulsive even though |0 I | am cleaning out their litter |1 box | at least once a day if not twice .
Any suggestions and helpful hints to make |1 this | a more positive experience would be extremely appreciated .
|0 That | 's kind of the way |0 it | goes .. lol .
Limit |1 them | to one room with easy to clean flooring .
"If |0 you | have limited |1 options | , try the |1 bathroom | ."
Make sure there are |0 plenty | of litter boxes that are cleaned often .
"Depending on the batch of kittens , |0 I | will often have as |1 many | as one per kitten ."
|0 They | can produce a |1 lot | of waste and even scooping twice a day |1 they | can get messy .
For some reason it takes |1 them | awhile to learn not to step in poop .
"Also if |0 they | have |1 diarrhea | , check in with your foster coordinator ."
|0 They | made need |1 medication | or deworming or something .
|0 They | are testing out their |1 claws | and teeth .
To some degree |0 you | can / should help teach |1 them | not to use their |1 teeth | and claws inappropriately .
"But in the meantime , highly recommend |1 jeans | and long sleeves anytime |0 you | 'll be interacting with the kittens ."
Then take |1 care | of yourself .
Get |1 plenty | of sleep and make sure |0 you | take |1 time | out to do some |1 things | |0 you | enjoy .
Try visiting the |1 kittens | a few times a day for short periods of time .
Try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy |1 them | for what |0 they | are .
"If |0 you | still do n't enjoy the |1 kittens | , see what other |0 opportunities | are available ."
"|0 They | may need foster |1 homes | for adult cats in different situations .. sick , recovering from surgery , need a little |1 socialization | , etc ."
|0 I | find the |0 adults | are much easier .
"Generally |0 they | 're not clawing and biting , |0 they | do n't make nearly as much |1 mess | , |0 they | do n't need nearly as much litterbox |1 scooping | , etc :)"
Decide |0 volunteering | is not your thing and give |1 them | back !
And do more |1 research | before |0 you | agree next time ;-)
Take the |1 kittens | back to the shelter .
"Maybe do volunteer |1 work | at the humane society , walk |1 dogs | , groom the |1 animals | etc ."
what r the |0 requirements | to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
what r the evidentary |0 requirements | to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
including fees and forms
|0 It | depends on if |0 you | ever registered the |1 birth | .
"Some |0 places | do the |1 registration | right at the hospital .... in some smaller places , |0 you | need to register your child 's |1 birth | at the town hall / registrar 's office ."
My first three children were born in Southern Ontario cities .
The birth registration was done right in hospital .
"My last son , was born in Northern Ontario ...."
|0 I | did n't know that |0 I | did n't register |1 him | in the ridiculous amount of paperwork |0 I | had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days .
"Two years later when |0 I | got around to filling for his birth certificate , |0 I | find out he was never registered ."
"|0 I | had to call the |1 Office | of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have |1 copies | of the delayed registration form mailed out to me , as |0 they | do n't have an online |1 area | for it yet , fill |1 those | out , send |1 them | away , then apply for his birth certificate ."
"If |0 you | are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time , it s simple to do |1 it | over the computer ."
For $ 56 |0 you | can even have |1 it | expedited and will get in three business days or your money back .
"|0 This | is in Ontario of course , the |0 rates | may be slightly different for other provinces / territories ."
"|0 You | just need basic |1 information | , and answer a few |1 questions | like what hospital was the child born at / |0 who | was the doctor ...."
"None , just walk in to the service office and present all the |1 identification | |0 you | have to prove your |1 identity | ."
"|0 they | may then chose to ask |1 you | to bring more |1 evidence | , or just look up the |1 record | and hand |2 you | the |1 certificate | ."
|0 You | can probably do |1 it | all on - line .
Start here if you were born in Ontario .
http://www.ontario.ca/en/information_bundle/birthcertificates/119274.html
"If you were born elsewhere , start here ."
http://www.ontario.ca/en/information_bundle/birthcertificates/119275.html
Good luck
My |0 parents | did n't send for my birth certificate until |0 I | was 16 and needed |1 it | for summer employment .
|0 It | was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place .
|0 I | add |1 that | in because there have been some |0 people | |0 who | have tried to claim |1 citizenship | by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in Canada or to Canadian parents .
When a child is born in Canada the birth is registered before the |0 baby | can leave the |1 hospital | .
As long as that was done |0 you | can send for it at any time .
Each provincial |0 government | has a |1 website | |0 that | lists the |1 process | for that Province so depending upon where you were born |0 you | can google |1 it | .
Royal Caribbean or Carnival cruise ?
ONLY IF |0 YOU | HAVE BEEN ON BOARD * BOTH * !!
|0 i | want to know |1 which | |0 you | liked better and WHY ?
include which |0 one | had :
- better food
- more fun activities
- more teens
- AND JUST MORE STUFF |0 YOU | LIKED OVERALL
please specify which royal or carnival |1 ship | (:
|0 Carnival | and Royal Caribbean are two popular cruise lines |0 that | have strong |1 followings | .
Some cruise |0 aficionados | refuse to sail on one or the other .
Are there any major |0 differences | between them ?
Explore which |0 cruise | may fit your |1 needs | the best .
For our comparison |0 we | sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas .
"Itinerary Both |0 ships | go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica , Grand Cayman , Cozumel , St. Thomas , the Bahamas and St. Martin / St. Maarten ."
"The |0 Liberty | also visited its private |1 island | Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk ."
The |0 Mariner | of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ) .
|0 We | loved |1 most | of the locations |1 that | |0 both | of the ships visited and do n't believe that |0 this | should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines .
Shows Each night there are a |0 variety | of shows .
Usually |0 you | have the main |1 show | and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .
|0 We | felt that the main |0 shows | on the Mariner of the Seas were better .
On the Liberty |0 we | liked the |1 comedian | and juggling act .
"If |0 you | love seeing the |1 shows | , Royal |0 Caribbean | was better for the main shows and |0 Carnival | was slightly better for the comedians ."
Dining Room |0 We | enjoyed the |1 atmosphere | of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas .
|0 We | felt that the |0 menu | had a little more |1 variety | on the Mariner of the Seas .
Friendliness of staff The |0 Liberty | and Mariner of the Seas both get high |1 grades | .
|0 We | did have one |1 waiter | |0 that | complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner .
"|0 We | had a slightly better |1 experience | on the Liberty , but feel that both |0 crews | did an excellent |1 job | and that |0 this | should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a |1 cruise | ."
Pools The |0 Mariner | of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water |1 pools | - |1 which | most cruise |0 ships | have .
|0 They | both had |1 pools | for kids and adults .
|0 We | liked the Liberty 's |1 pools | better because |0 one | had a |1 slide | .
"If |0 you | have |1 kids | , |0 this | would be something |1 that | |0 they | would definitely enjoy ."
Spa |0 We | tried the |1 spa | on the Liberty and loved |1 it | .
|0 We | did not try the |1 spa | on the Mariner of the Seas .
Usually |0 you | ca n't go wrong when getting a spa |1 treatment | ......
"Royal |0 Caribbean | is better , but the best |0 cruiseline | is Regent Seven Seas ."
Look on their website rssc.com
Royal Caribbean .
Carnival has been called the WalMart of cruise lines ...
What countries are the |0 best | to travel to ?
|0 I | really want to travel when |0 I | leave |1 school | !
Where in the states could |0 I | go ?
Where in Europe ?
Have |0 you | every traveled before ?
How long should |0 I | go for to each place ?
( |0 I | Have 1 year before collage ! )
& Also how much |1 money | would |0 I | need ?
So |0 I | can start saving now hehe
Thanks :)
"|0 I | mean when |0 I | graduate & yes , college , sorry for the typo ."
Leave High |1 School | ?
Not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if |0 you | 've never traveled before and |0 you | do n't put where |0 you | would be traveling from .
In the United States ?
Lots of places .
"There are |0 50 | of them , |0 48 | located from Maine to Florida and California to Washington State and all in between ."
There are 2 |0 more | located outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific .
|1 What | do |0 you | like to do ?
"Big Cities like New York , Boston , Philadelphia on the East Coast ."
"Beaches and Disney of Florida or the Mid Atlantic cities of Atlanta , Savannah , Charleston ."
"The federal sites of Washington , DC ."
"Southern charm of Nashville , Birmingham , New Orleans or Charlotte ."
"West Coast hot spots like Seattle , Portland , San Francisco , Los Angeles or San Diego ."
Europe ?
Just as numerous as the possibilities of the US .
Do |0 you | speak a foreign |1 language | ?
|0 I | could spend a year in Spain alone .
From Madrid to Seville to Barcelona an Valencia .
"Bilboa on the north coast , Pamplona and the very famous Guernica ."
A road trip to Lisbon and the Algarve in Portugal before a mountain escape in the Pyrenees and a stop in Andorra before heading over to France and Italy and Austria and Switzerland .
"|0 I | 've traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a |1 trip | to your needs based on budget , actual time allowed , your likes and dislikes ."
|0 Amount | of time could be dependent on so many things .
Do |0 you | want to see all the |1 sites | or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place .
Does your |0 budget | limit |1 you | to how long |0 you | can stay in each place ?
"|0 You | need a |1 lot | of money for hotels , airfare , seeing the |1 sites | , food , local transport - |0 you | name |1 it | but |0 life | costs ."
"Once |0 you | have a |1 budget | or an amount in the bank then |0 you | 'll be able to figure out where |0 you | can go , for how long |0 you | can go and |1 what | |0 you | can do when |0 you | 're there ."
1 year before collage or college ?
Good luck .
|0 I | recommend buying a single unlimited |1 Europass | and travelling |1 anywhere | in the EU your |0 heart | desires .
|0 You | ca n't beat the |1 price | for what |0 you | get .
come to Africa .
"Nigeria , a lovely country ."
But where in nigeria ?
Obudu cattle ranch .
More than a tourist centre .
How do |0 you | make your |1 cat | adjust to a new house ?
|0 Me | and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town .
|0 We | are currently living a |1 mile | from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new |0 house | is beside a busy road .
|0 We | have had the |1 cat | for 10 years and do nt want to leave |1 it | .
How could |0 we | make |1 it | settle in a new house .
|0 you | are not just moving |1 house | - your |0 cat | is losing his |1 territory | .
"|0 territory | is very important to cats , and |0 they | are very nervous when |0 they | go into a new place - a new |0 house | could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least |0 he | thinks so ."
"|0 you | will need to give |2 him | only a small |1 place | to explore , so |0 he | can make |1 it | his territory , and feel safe there ."
"then , |0 he | can have a |1 place | to retreat to when |0 he | feels scared ."
"|0 you | will need to get his |1 box | and bowls , and whatever |0 blanket | and toys are his , and smell like home , and put |1 him | in a room ."
"the |0 room | |0 you | sleep in is best ( seeing |1 you | so relaxed that |0 you | are sleeping will send the |1 message | that |0 everything | is OK ) , but |0 others | will work just as well ."
"close the |1 door | , and keep |1 him | in there for a week ."
"|0 he | will feel much safer in that one room , than in a huge unknown house ."
"|0 he | will explore the |1 room | , mark |1 everything | with his cheek , and try to make |1 it | feel like his territory ."
"|0 he | will reassure |1 himself | that no other |0 animal | is in there , and that no other |0 animal | will come in - |0 he | is afraid that |0 he | is in someone else 's territory when |0 he | is in a new house ."
"in a week 's time , |0 he | will have made |1 it | his , and will be getting more bored than afraid ."
"let |1 him | out for half an hour , to explore ."
then put |1 him | back in .
"he will be freaked out , so going back to his territory will make |1 him | much happier ."
"extend the |1 time | |0 he | is out each day , but for the first month , always put |1 him | in his room at night , so |0 he | feels safe to sleep ."
"soon |0 he | will make the whole |1 house | his , but |0 he | needs that one safe |1 place | to start from ."
"remember to visit with him while |0 he | is in the room , and tell |1 him | how good |0 he | is ."
"remember to give |2 him | the |1 time | |0 he | needs to feel that the |0 room | is his - rush |1 it | , and |0 he | will be afraid of the whole house for a long time ."
|0 he | might even start peeing on things in fear .
good luck with your new house and with his new territory !
Let |1 her | explore when |0 we | moved my |0 cat | had to explore the entire |1 house | before |0 she | felt comfortable .
In time though |0 she | / he will adjust . :)
|0 they | just do |1 it | on their own .
|0 I | just adopted a 2 year old male German |1 Shepherd | with Major bad behaviors ?
"Last night , |0 I | adopted a 2 year old Male German |1 Shepherd | ."
"( |0 He | is 92 pounds ) |0 He | does not listen to any commands , but my major |0 problem | is that |0 he | will not go outside on command , or even with me ."
|0 I | will walk outside and |0 he | will stand at the door and stare at me or run away .
My other MAJOR |0 problem | is that |0 he | will not get in his crate .
"|0 I | will get a |1 treat | and try to get |1 him | in there that way , |0 it | wo nt work ."
|0 He | wo nt even get close to the crate .
"If |0 I | come towards him , |0 he | will run away ."
How do |0 I | train |1 him | to feel comfortable in his crate ?
and to willingly go outside ... and to come on command .
|0 He | wo nt do |1 anything | on command .
|0 It | s very frustrating .
|0 I | have a 9 month old German |1 Shepherd | |1 that | |0 I | raised from a puppy .
|0 I | trained |1 her | myself .
"|0 She | is crate trained , potty trained , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while |0 I | throw a |1 treat | across the floor or even right next to her paw , and |0 she | wo nt get |1 it | until |0 I | give |2 her | the |1 command | ."
"Yes , lots of time and lots of patients ..."
|0 I | just do nt know how to do |1 it | with a grown dog .
|0 She | tosses |1 me | around like |0 it | s nothing !
"... but basically , |1 what | |0 I | do is the same thing |0 I | did with my puppy ... lots of patience , lots of time , lots of praise , lots of treats , and lots of repition .... Right ?"
Is there any |0 tricks | |0 I | could use ?
Maybe get a |1 book | on training .
|0 You | have to be in command at all times .
There are |0 ways | to get your new |1 dog | used to the crate or going out .
|0 I | would start with a leash .
Put the |1 leash | on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times .
Then take the |1 leash | off and do |1 nothing | else but that .
Later do |1 it | again .
"When the |0 dog | is ok with this , then open the |1 door | and walk around the crate , leave the |1 door | open all the time ."
Put |1 something | fun inside .
Let your |1 dog | go in when |0 he | wants to for no reason .
Do not shut the |1 door | .
Let |1 him | walk in and out for a few days .
At some point |0 he | will feel ok with this and |0 you | can then close the |1 door | but not for long at all .
Open the |1 door | and let |1 him | out and see how |0 he | acts .
"If |0 you | push |1 it | , |0 it | will never work ."
"With going outside , put the |1 leash | on and just take |1 him | for a walk ."
|0 He | will learn to really like |1 this | .
|0 Potty | outside will come at some point .
Try obedience |1 classes | .
"Have |1 patience | with him , |0 you | just got |1 him | and |0 who | knows how he was treated before |0 you | brought |1 him | home ."
where can |0 I | find the best |1 tours | to the Mekong Delta at reasonable prices ?
will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and |0 I | am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta .
|0 I | have been researching on line and find |0 things | are quite pricey but the |0 tours | look great .
Should |0 I | just settle and book on line ?
or is |0 it | better if |0 I | wait till |0 I | get there ?
"If |0 I | wait , would the |0 tours | |0 I | find there for less money be the same quality type tours ?"
"Also , any tour |0 recommendations | would be very helpful a well ."
Thank |1 you | !

"There is n't |0 much | to see in the delta , |0 it | 's a lifestyle not a resort area ."
If |0 you | 're adventurous |0 you | can take a |1 bus | or water taxi to My Tho ( near where |0 we | live ) or Can Tho .
"From either of those cities , |0 you | can venture out and spend a day in the country ."
|0 Most | of the tourists that |0 I | 've come across buy |1 tours | along the My Tho waterfront .
"|0 You | take a |1 boat | across the river , then spend a |1 day | biking , eating at a local restaurant , buying |1 souvenirs | and doing other |1 things | that are geared towards tourists ."
"The |0 countryside | is very beautiful , especially if |0 you | have a few |1 months | ( or years ) to get to know the |1 place | ."
"PS , If |0 you | make |1 it | to Thanh Pho Ben Tre , stay a |1 night | at my friend Ken 's hotel ."
It 's called Kiwi Heaven and |0 it | 's across the river from Cho Ben Tre .
"|0 It | 's a little hard to get to by foot , |0 they | 're rebuilding the |1 bridge | , but |0 you | can get |1 someone | to moto - taxi |1 you | there for a dollar or less ."
|0 He | 's an ex-pat from New Zealand and he 's been in town for awhile .

|0 Intrepid | is good at getting |1 you | away from the most touristy spots and showing |2 you | |1 something | a little different .
yoga and horses ..... ?
|0 I | got a riding |1 lesson | today on one of my boss 's fino horses and |0 it | made |1 me | realize just how unsteady my left |0 leg | is .
|0 I | mentioned |1 it | to my boss and |0 she | said to start doing |1 yoga | .
But there are just so many |0 poses | and programs !
Any good poses or programs ( |0 I | 'm willing to buy a |1 dvd | as long as |0 it | is under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
|0 I | just have a few |1 issues | supporting my |1 back | and my left |0 leg | flops .
Because |0 I | do n't feel like spending over |1 $ | 20 on a freakin DVD
|0 I | also have back |1 problems | |0 that | transfer into my legs .
"|0 I | have done |1 Yoga | for riders for a while , a 20 minute routine |0 I | found on YouTube ( |0 I | think it s called "" Yoga for horse back riding "" hosted by a man ) |0 It | helped with noticing slight |1 differences | in my balance and weight distribution but helped not really for the way |0 I | use my |1 legs | and back ."
Here is |0 what | |0 I | do now and |0 it | really helps ....
When |0 I | first get on |0 I | take 1 |1 leg | and pull |1 it | back up to touch my |1 butt | with my heel and hold |1 it | there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
Then the same thing with the other leg .
"Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my |0 legs | pulled out as far as |0 I | can , so |0 they | are not touching the |1 saddle | ."
"Then a lap doing |1 scissors | , one |0 leg | forward as far as |0 I | can and the |0 other | back , then switch |1 legs | ."
"|0 I | 'll also trot doing , down 2 beats , up one for a wile , then up 2 down 1 making sure the |0 weight | is going into the balls of my feet ."
If the |0 weight | is going into your heels ( |0 it | throws your |1 leg | forward ) put the |1 stirrups | up against the heel of your boot .
"Do a nice working |1 trot | , not a slow trot ."
"All |0 this | will help |1 you | use both |1 legs | evenly , keep proper |1 contact | and use your |1 wight | correctly , to keep your |1 leg | in a good position ."
"BTW |0 you | do nt want your |1 leg | locked in place , |0 it | will move WITH the horse a bit ."
When |0 I | first started doing |1 it | |0 I | 'd do |1 it | every day .
Now |0 I | just do |1 it | once or twice a week or as needed .
"Now not only is my |0 leg | better , but my |0 back | is relaxing ."
what are |0 you | having |1 problems | with ?
"|0 i | would n't bother with yoga |0 i | 'd practice more with riding and fixing my |1 problem | , ride bareback , with no irons , there s also a |0 way | to ride on your knees ?"
|0 that | help alot with your thigh muscles ( bareback though )
ya |0 i | really would n't bother with the yoga
"maybe a back |0 brase | will help , sometimes my |0 back | really gets to me and |0 i | 've thought about getting |1 one | ."
"with your |0 leg | flopping , just try putting all your |1 weight | in your heel and hang on with only your legs , holding my |1 leg | back helps |1 me | with flopping the more |0 it | 's forward the more |0 it | flops :/ work your calf |1 muscles | , maybe try standing on the edge of your steps ( on the ball of your foot ) and balance to strengthen those |1 muscles |"
|0 You | do n't want to spend more than |1 $ | 20 and yet |0 you | have an expensive |1 hobby | like riding |1 horses | ?
|0 I | really ca n't help |1 you | .
|0 What | to feed my |1 dog | after gastroenteritis ?
My |0 dog | has been sick for about 3 days now .
|0 He | has been having |1 diarheya | everywhere and |0 he | began to vomit last night .
|0 I | thought |0 it | would pass until |0 he | started to vomit |1 blood | and would nt drink any |1 water | .
|0 I | took |1 him | to the Animal Hospital and |0 they | ran blood |1 work | and |0 everything | came back normal .
No pancreatitis or anything abnormal .
"The |0 vet | said |0 it | was gastroenteritis and gave |2 him | |1 fluids | under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics ."
So my |0 question | is ..
Is it normal for dogs to throw up |1 blood | while having |1 gastroenteritis | ?
and will these |0 antibiotics | help ?
|0 I | have tryed to give |2 him | |1 water | but |0 he | wo nt take |1 it | .. |1 what | should |0 i | do ?
|0 i | do nt want |1 him | to get dehydrated and also should |0 i | try to give |2 him | a little |1 bit | of food ?
... Some |0 help | would be great .
thank |1 you | :)
|0 They | did nt take x - |1 rays | |0 they | offered |1 them | but |0 i | just could nt afford any more |1 treatment | .
|0 I | feel like shit for saying |1 that | but after |1 what | |0 they | have done already |0 i | wo nt be buying |1 grocerys | for the next few weeks .
|0 I | will give |2 them | and |1 call | and see |1 what | |0 they | say .
Thank |1 you | for the help .
Ok so |0 i | spoke to the vet and |0 he | said the give |2 him | white |1 rice | and boiled chicken but only a little at a time .
Seince |0 he | recieved the |1 fluids | last night |0 he | said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days .
|0 I | went home at lunch to check on him and |0 he | is doing 1000 etter |0 he | was actually walkin around and wagin his |1 tail | :) thanks |1 everbody | for the info it s greatly appreciated .
To answer your |1 questions | in order :
"1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have |1 blood | in it ."
"However , if |0 they | have been vomiting numerous times , then the |0 blood | could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines ."
"|0 He | could also have |1 Parvovirus | , a GI foreign body , or any number of things ."
Did your |0 vet | take |1 radiographs | ( x - rays ) ?
2 ) Your |0 vet | would not prescribe |1 them | if |0 they | did n't think |0 it | would be helpful .
"3 ) If |0 he | shows no |1 interest | in water , then take |1 him | back to your vet ."
|0 It | could be due to nausea or any number of things .
|0 He | could become severly dehydrated ( especially if |0 he | continues to vomit and have |1 diarrhea | ) .
"From there |0 you | end up with electrolyte imbalances , |0 which | can lead to heart and kidney problems ."
"And being dehydrated , vomiting , and having |1 diarrhea | just does n't feel good ."
4 ) Call your |1 vet | .
"|0 They | should have discussed a bland |1 diet | with you , including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting ."
"It sounds like your |0 dog | may benefit from being hospitalized , and put on IV fluids to help his |1 hydration | , administer the antibiotics |1 IV | , and to ensure that |0 he | starts to recover ."
|0 You | should ABSOLUTELY call your |1 veterinarian | back immediately to clarify |1 anything | |0 you | have |1 questions | about .
"|0 They | have seen your |1 pet | , and are most aware of his condition ."
No |0 one | online will be able to assist |1 you | more than your |0 vet | can .
|0 You | need to ask your |2 vet | these |1 questions | .
Boiled WHITE rice and boiled chicken breast .
Bland food .
NO SPICES !
"My |0 vet | told |1 me | when a |0 dog | is vomiting a lot , |0 it | could be a sign of obstruction ."
Did |0 they | do any x - |1 rays | ?
|0 I | do n't know if vomiting |1 blood | is common with this ailment .
|0 You | should call your |1 vet | now and ask |2 them | |0 what | is normal or not .
French dating etiquette ?
|0 I | would really love to hear |1 what | the |0 French | or those |0 who | had dated the |1 French | to say |1 something | about this .
|0 I | 'm in my 20's and currently studying in France .
"Coming from an anglo - saxon country my |0 version | of dating is ' getting the |1 number | , asking |1 her | out , etc. . '"
"However , |0 I | 've read on the internet that the French dating |0 etiquette | is totally different ."
"For them , |0 dating | would normally be meeting in groups or parties , then pairing off ."
"In addition , from my understanding one - on - one |0 dates | is something |0 that | comes much later and not ' straight - away ' like us anglo - saxons ."
|0 They | are also very secretive about being in a relationship .
|0 They | only ' go out in the open ' once |0 they | have reached a certain |1 level | of seriousness .
Is |0 it | true ?
"|0 I | have told a French |1 girl | |0 I | liked |1 her | , and |0 she | accepted ."
|0 She | is friendly when |0 we | see each |1 other | on campus .
|0 She | is also nicer when |0 we | are both alone .
"However , when |0 we | are at parties or when they are |0 people | around |0 she | seems to ignore |1 me | ."
"|0 She | also seems to hate it |1 whenever | |0 I | ask |1 her | out on a date , to the point |0 she | said stop !"
My |0 mind | thinks |0 she | has no |1 interest | in me and just stringing |1 me | along .
But the |0 articles | |0 I | read seemed to say the |1 contrary | .
Have |0 I | just fallen |1 victim | in a cultural trap ?
|0 What | |0 you | have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course |0 it | does not fit all |1 scenarios | .
"|0 You | are not French for a start , so the "" |0 rules | "" or "" customs "" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds ."
From what |0 you | say the |0 messages | given by this girl are quite clear .
|0 She | is not stringing |1 you | along since |0 she | is actually discouraging |1 you | and is honest enough to tell |1 you | to stop asking |1 her | out .
|0 She | is just being friendly in public because |0 she | does not want to offend |1 you | and |0 she | treats |1 you | like any other friend .
"|0 You | said |0 you | liked |1 her | and |0 she | accepted |1 it | as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but |0 it | does not mean |0 she | fancies |1 you | or wants to pair off with you ."
"At parties |0 she | does not want to be considered in any way attached to you , |0 which | is consistent ."
"Take the |1 messages | for what |0 they | are : |0 she | has no |1 objection | in |0 you | being pals at uni , but |0 she | does not want to take |1 matters | further ."
""" Non ! "" means "" |1 non | "" , not "" |0 I | might consider |1 it | , and |0 I | will keep |1 you | attached to my apron strings just in case . """
|0 Christiane | gave |2 you | a good |1 answer | .
|0 You | have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding .
"|0 What | |0 I | have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender |1 groups | of friends , there 's |0 nothing | unusual in |0 boys | and girls being only friends , |0 which | is obviously what this |0 girl | wants from you ."
"|0 She | probably finds your |1 company | pleasing as a friend but |0 you | are not her choice a a boyfriend and |0 she | is trying to keep it on a friendship level , and trying to make |1 you | understand that |0 she | does n't want to go further ."
If |0 she | is nicer when |0 you | are alone |0 I | 'd say |0 it | is because in public view |0 she | is making sure that |0 people | do not think that |0 you | might be her boyfriend .
|0 You | do find |1 the | ' |1 get | the |1 number | hop in bed with her ' but be aware that |0 they | usually have a |1 reputation | as sluts .
"Unfair for the girl as |0 boys | do n't have that |1 kind | of handicap , but |0 that | 's the way our own |0 rules | work ."
Should have done |1 research | before |0 you | left .

"Try living in Sydney on a teacher 's salary , then compare |1 it | to somewhere like Central Otago ."

It 's probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student |1 loan | .

why does my baby king |0 snake | refuse to eat ?
|0 i | have a baby eastern king |1 snake | .
|0 i | have tried |1 EVERYTHING | |0 i | can to get |1 him | to eat but |0 he | refuses .
"|0 he | has a great |1 environment | , with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp ."
"as far as |0 i | know , |0 everything | is as good as |0 it | can be where his |0 aquarium | is concerned ."
"according to the vet , |0 he | is healthy and looks good ."
|0 he | has been going to the bathroom like |0 he | should .
( |0 i | know that |0 snakes | |0 that | have |1 problems | going to the bathroom wo n't eat . )
"|0 he | has been drinking |1 water | ( |0 i | am pretty sure |0 he | has been drinking |1 it | out of his bowl , but also |0 i | have been feeding |2 him | |1 water | and |0 he | does n't ever give |2 me | a |1 problem | with that - |0 i | just stick his |1 head | near the water and |0 he | sucks |1 it | down . )"
|0 i | handle |1 him | every few days .
"|0 he | is feisty , as most king |0 snakes | are , but |0 he | is a very nice little guy - |0 he | never tries to bite or anything ."
|0 i | just love |1 him | to death .
|0 i | do n't know why |0 he | wo n't eat though !
|0 i | have tried feeding |2 him | 5 or 6 live |1 pinkies | and 4 or 5 frozen ( thawed ) pinkies .
|0 i | have never tried feeding |2 him | a |1 pinky | |0 that | was bigger around than |0 he | is .
|0 i | have tried putting |1 him | in a small container and putting |1 him | in a dark place for an hour or so and |0 he | wo n't touch the |1 pinky | .
|0 he | crawls on top of them but does not try to eat |1 them | .
|0 he | does n't seem to know that |0 they | are food .
"|0 i | have tried "" braining "" both live and dead |1 pinkies | , and bloodying |1 them | up to get his |1 attention | , but |0 he | does n't care ."
"|0 i | have tried dipping both live and thawed |1 pinkies | in tuna juice , and in used gerbil bedding ."
|0 i | have bought some long reptile feeding |1 tweezers | and have tried holding the |1 pinky | in front of the snake 's face .
|0 he | wo nt even try to bite .
|0 i | am very discouraged and sad and |0 i | do n't know |0 what | to do .
|0 he | has n't eaten in an entire month .
|0 i | 've only tried to feed |2 him | |1 one | at a time .
"|0 he | 's just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil ."
do |0 babies | this small hibernate ?
When |0 you | feed |1 him | how many |1 pinkies | do |0 you | feed |2 him | ?
If |0 you | feed |2 him | too |1 many | |0 he | could just not be hungry .
If |0 he | does n't seem interested in them at all |0 I | would say |0 he | 's just not hungry .
My |0 boyfriend | has |1 one | and when |0 she | 's hungry |0 she | attacks the |1 pinkie | right away .
|0 They | can smell |1 it | so |0 i | 'm sure |0 he | knows what |0 it | is and just do n't want |1 it | .
Remember |0 snakes | can go a |1 while | without eating .
"In the winter , |0 they | will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation - like |1 state | called brumation , which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity ."
"King |0 snakes | sometimes stop eating , particularly during the cooler part of the year ."
|0 They | have a natural |1 instinct | to hibernate .
"If the |0 snake | is not pregnant or shedding , and its enclosure is properly equipped , a |0 loss | of appetite probably signals a |1 beginning | of hibernation ."
"|0 Hibernation | is natural , and a necessity for snakes |0 that | are going to be bred ."
Another |0 thing | |0 that | can cause a king |1 snake | to stop eating is shedding .
"|0 You | can tell when your king |0 snake | is about to shed , because its |0 eyes | will get milky looking ."
"Its |0 body | will be dull looking , too ."
In a few days the |0 snake | will begin to shed its |1 skin | .
"For example , some |0 snakes | will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter , feeding mainly in spring and fall ."
|0 It | 's natural and so long as |0 you | do n't see any serious |1 deterioration | in their health is nothing to worry about .
"|0 You | see , some |0 snakes | for no obvious reason will simply go off their food ."
|0 They | 're fit and healthy and their |0 care | is suitable .

are my two |0 cats | fighting or playing ?
how |0 rough | is too rough ?
help !?
|0 i | have a 1 and a half year old male neutered |1 cat | and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten .
the first night |0 i | brought |1 her | home |0 i | did the sniffing under the door |1 thing | and left |1 it | at that .
"the next day |0 i | let |1 her | out of the bedroom so |0 they | could check each |1 other | out , and the |0 kitten | hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each |1 other | and now |0 she | no longer hisses and |0 they | have been playing ( chasing each |1 other | up and down the hall , rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other ) ."
only once it looked like my male |0 cat | was biting at her neck and then her stomach and |0 she | was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then |0 he | backed off and now |0 they | are fine .
were they roughhouse playing ?
or were |0 they | actually fighting ?
"|0 he | has been "" biting "" at her neck and stomach previously while |0 they | play without |0 her | meowing or anything so |0 i | m wondering if |0 he | went a little to far that one time ."
any |0 answers | help !!!!!!
|0 you | did not leave the new |1 kitten | in the room long enough .
"|0 you | need to do |1 that | for a least a week , or else this |0 type | of territorial fighting will happen ."
giving the new |2 kitten | her own small |1 territory | will help |1 her | to feel safe and will give |2 her | a |1 place | to go to when scared .
"right now , your |0 male | is fighting off an |1 intruder | , and |0 he | feels that |0 all | of the house is his ."
"put |1 her | back in the room , and keep the |1 door | closed for a week ."
then let |1 her | out for ten minutes .
"make |1 it | fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on ."
"|0 this | will do two |1 things | ; the new |0 kitten | will rub her |1 cheek | on the furniture in her room , making |1 it | her territory ."
|0 she | will start to calm down and feel safe - |0 you | can bet |0 she | does n't now .
"|0 she | knows |0 she | is invading someone else 's |1 territory | , but ca n't help |1 it | , and has no where to go ."
|0 she | will be able to sleep without being afraid .
"as well , your |0 male | will be able to see that his territory is not threatened ."
"when the |0 door | opens , |0 he | will get that the one |0 room | is hers , and |0 he | will be OK with that ."
the territory thing will be solved .
your |0 male | is hurting |1 her | to put |1 her | in her place - biting her |1 scruff | is dominance and biting the |1 belly | is a move |0 cats | use when hunting - to pull the |1 guts | out of their prey .
|0 this | is not good .
"give |2 them | |1 time | to set up their |1 territories | , and once |0 you | bring the new |1 kitten | out , pay a |1 lot | of attention to the male ."
"|0 you | have brought |1 someone | else into his territory , and |0 he | needs to be reminded that |0 you | still love |1 him | , and support his |1 claim | to his space ."
"|0 that | will help to reassure |1 him | , and |0 he | will be less aggressive with her ."
"when |0 they | play fight , |0 they | do n't hiss ."
"if |0 they | hiss , |0 they | are not playing ."
"if |0 they | bite , and |0 one | cries , |0 you | must separate |1 them | , and |0 you | must keep an |1 eye | on them ."
"|0 hissing | is OK , unless |0 they | start to fight ."
"if |0 that | happens , separate |1 them | , and give |2 them | |1 time | apart ."
"putting the |1 girl | in her territory will make |1 her | feel less afraid , and |0 she | will relax ."
good luck !
"A |0 hiss | is basically a "" get the f*ck away "" sound ."
|0 It | means |0 they | 've gone too far .
When |0 they | start bleeding |0 that | means |0 they | 're really fighting .
"If |0 they | 're going kinda slow and like fake biting ( not biting as hard as |0 they | can ) , and fake scratching ( not hitting as hard as |0 they | can with their paws ) then |0 they | 're playing ."
"|0 I | have two |1 cats | , and at first |0 they | hissed at each other because |0 cats | are very territorial , but now |0 they | do fight and play ."
"The |0 difference | is when the |0 cat | hisses , |0 that | means |0 they | are annoyed and |0 they | want the other |1 cat | to go away ."
|0 That | means |0 they | are fighting .
When |0 they | are just jumping at each other and their |0 tails | are wagging |0 that | means that |0 they | are playing .
|0 I | can see how |0 you | get confused though . :)

When |0 Johnson | deployed |1 troops | in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half - million |0 troops | about ten years to pacify South |1 Vietnam | .
|0 He | refused to believe |1 them | and ordered the |1 military | to win the |1 war | within two to three years ( before the next election in 1968 ) .
|0 He | did not give |2 them | the |1 number | of troops |0 they | requested .
"|0 This | left |1 Westmoreland | with few options , so |0 he | adapted a Search and Destroy |1 strategy | instead of a Clear and Defend strategy |0 which | is , in the long run , the preferred method of pacifying an |1 insurgency | ."
"|0 Thing | is , |0 it | worked ."
"The |0 ARVN | was not having a big |1 problem | with the Local VC ( the guerilla movement ) , they were being challenged by the Main Force VC ( |0 which | was light infantry ) and the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) ."
"When the |0 Americans | swept in with their Search and Destroy operations the |0 Communists | quickly leaned |0 they | could not stand up to the US firepower , and these regular troops were forced to flee the |1 country | and take |1 sanctuary | across the borders in Laos and Cambodia ."
"All those sunny |0 reports | about the progress in Vietnam were correct , the Communists WERE being defeated ."
"However , |0 Johnson | would not let the |1 military | cross the |1 borders | and clean out the Communist |1 bases | ."
"He was warned that |0 they | were building up a huge |1 Army | and would eventually launch an |1 attack | , but |0 he | ignored his military |1 advisers | ."
The |0 Communists | agreed .
|0 They | could not defeat the |1 Americans | .
"However , |0 what | |0 they | hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the |1 ARVN | in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend |1 operations | ."
"The |0 Communists | thought |0 they | could defeat the |1 ARVN | , cause the |1 fall | of the South Vietnamese government , and the |0 people | would than rally to the Communist cause and leave the |1 Americans | stranded in a sea of angry peasants ."
|0 THAT | WAS THE PLAN .
|0 What | happened ?
The |0 Americans | detected the |1 attempt | to infiltrate the urban |1 areas | and were already redeploying |1 troops | from the rural areas .
The |0 ARVN | rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked .
Within 24 hours every Communist assault had been defeated except in the ancient capital of Hue .
The |0 government | did NOT fall .
And the South Vietnamese people ?
"When give the ultimate |1 choice | , |0 they | rallied …"
TO THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT ….
|0 Tet | was a huge military and political disaster for the Communists .
They were chased back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit .
"The |0 people | rejected their |1 attempt | to topple the |1 government | , and for all intents and purposes the US |0 military | ( and the ARVN ) handed |2 Johnson | the |1 victory | |0 he | had ordered |1 them | to achieve within the time - frame |0 he | ordered |1 it | ."
|0 All | |0 he | had to do for a complete victory was allow the |1 military | to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist |1 forces | .
But |0 Johnson | was so obtuse |0 he | did n’t understand |0 he | had a |1 victory | when it was handed to him on a silver platter .
"Instead |0 he | pulled the |1 military | off , stopped the |1 bombing | of North Vietnam , withdrew from the presidential race , and spent the |1 rest | of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam ."
|0 They | screwed up by not accepting his |1 surrender | when |0 he | offered |1 it | .
"The American |0 people | were NOT having |1 any | of it , and elected |1 Richard | Nixon to fix the |1 mess | |0 LBJ | had made ( not to surrender like the antiwar |0 movement | was demanding ) ."
In the end |0 Nixon | kept his |1 promise | for “ … peace with honor …. ”
But |0 that | ’s another question .
"To emancipate the |1 south | , but |0 it | was a serious failure ."
To make the |1 war | unpalatable to the American public .
"In that , |0 they | pretty much succeeded ."
"Before Tet , the |0 war | was unpopular but tolerable to the majority of Americans in that the loss of American lives was seen as the cost of subduing the |1 VC | and NVA ."
|0 Tet | made it clear that the |0 war | was a long way from being over if the |0 Americans | thought |0 they | could preserve the |1 South | and that the |0 North | was perfectly willing to suffer great |1 losses | to continue their |1 fight | .
There is a very good |0 book | on the subject that was written by General Vo Nguyen Giap .
Try |1 google | to find the |1 title | if |0 you | would like to read |1 it | .
Bearded dragon question ... ?
|0 I | just bought a |1 baby | one yesterday .
|0 I | have a basking spot |1 lamp | |0 that | says |0 it | is a double reflector |0 that | focuses 35 % more |1 light | / heat and provides beneficial UVA |1 rays | important to the psycholical well - being of him .
"My |0 question | is does |0 that | mean |0 it | gives |2 him | not only the |1 heat | , but the "" sun rays "" |0 he | needs ?"
|0 I | also was wondering how long should this |0 light | be on .
"The |0 lady | at pet smart said 4 |1 hours | , but on places on the net |0 it | says 10 to 12 |1 hours | ."
"|0 He | 's getting used to his new home , but has n't eatin yet ."
|0 I | have bearded dragon juvenile |1 food | and freeze - dried crickets .
Any advice would be greatly appreciated .
Thank |1 you | for your time .
"Let |1 me | try to break |1 this | down as simply as |0 I | can : diurnal ( active during the day time ) |0 reptiles | like the bearded dragon require 3 |1 types | of "" light , "" UVA , UVB , and heat ."
"Any white light emitting light |0 source | will emit |1 UVA | , including heat bulbs , |0 that | 's the easy one to provide for ."
UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source .
"|0 UVB | will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless |0 you | use a |1 MVB | ( mercury vapor bulb ) |0 which | is the only reptile use bulb |0 that | will emit both |1 UVB | and heat from one bulb ."
|0 I | highly recommend that |0 you | do not use coiled / compact UVB |1 bulbs | as they are known to cause severe eye |1 damage | and / or blindness in reptiles not to mention |0 they | have |1 trouble | maintaining UVB |1 output | over time .
"The long tube UVB |0 bulbs | are best , like Zoomed 's Repsitun model : http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ Remember to replace UVB |1 bulbs | according to the manufacturer s recommendation after which time the |0 bulb | will no longer produce |1 UVB | even if visible |0 light | still is ."
"So , to answer your |1 question | , no , if |0 you | just have a |1 bulb | |0 that | says |0 it | produces |1 UVA | then |0 you | do not have "" the sun 's |1 rays | "" |1 that | your |0 bearded | needs ."
|0 You | need to also provide a |1 source | a UVB lighting .
The |0 person | at Petsmart is very wrong ; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess |1 what | most pet store |0 employees | tell |1 you | ; |0 they | do n't have the best track |1 record | regarding giving reliable pet care |1 info | .
"|0 UVB | and basking temp ( should be about 110 F for a baby , 95 F for an adult ) should be available for 10 - 12 hours a day ."
Freeze dried |0 food | is not a good staple food source ; |0 you | need to offer live feeder |1 insects | .
"Bearded |0 dragons | are sight hunters , |0 they | need to see the |0 food | move to trigger a feeding |1 response | , especially when |0 they | are babies ."
Live |0 food | is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried .
"|0 Crickets | , silk worms , phoenix worms , and various feeder roaches , like red - lobster , turkistan , and dubia , are good example of staple insects to offer your |1 bearded | ."
"Wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items , for variety 's sake ."
|0 I | would highly recommend that |0 you | read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure |0 you | have |0 everything | set up correctly :
http://herp-info.webs.com/beardeddragon.htm
http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/caresheet/?page=1
mm |0 it | depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever |0 you | have |1 him | in .. atleast as far as |0 i | 'm concerned .
"if there are shady |0 areas | |0 he | can move to ( for example a 3 x 5 x 4 tank with light on one side ) then |0 you | can leave |1 it | on a full 12 - 14 hours , if |0 it | s a small tank and |0 he | ca n't escape the |1 light | then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day ."
either way |0 you | also need to keep an |1 eye | on the temperature if |0 you | are using a dry fish |1 tank | as UV |0 lights | in my experience up the |1 temperature | significantly and without proper ventilation |0 it | can become an oven .
as to what the |0 light | provides |0 it | gives UV |1 rays | .. |0 which | is important for health in lizards as |0 it | is in humans .
That |0 lady | at PetSmart is a disgrace to the rest of us PetSmart associates ... sheesh .
"Yes , |0 it | gives |2 him | the "" sun |1 rays | "" necessary , |0 that | 's what |0 UVA | is ."
"And |0 it | should be on 10 - 12 hours , just like the |0 sun | would be up for 10 - 12 hours in his natural environment ."
"As for the heat , just be sure to use a |1 thermometer | ."
"Also , |0 Beardies | often do not eat |1 food | |0 that | is not moving , so it s anyone 's |0 guess | whether or not |0 he | 'll touch the freeze - dried |1 crickets | or the processed food ."
"|0 I | tell all my |2 customers | |0 they | can try |1 it | , but do n't count on it ."
"Also try green leafy |1 veggies | , like kale and spinach ."
Best of luck !
Is a |0 finch | or a parakeet better ?
"|0 I | am making a christmas |1 list | for my parents and |0 i | was going to ask for a bird and |0 these | are the affordable ones |1 that | |0 i | like , and |0 i | was wondering : |0 which | would not bite alot , and |0 which | are more fun to have as pets AND |0 I | NEED TO KNOW |0 WHICH | WOULD BE QUIETEST |0 i | honestly do nt care but my |0 family | does !"
Please help |1 me | !
oh and please say y |0 one | is better thx !!!!!!
"Hi there ,"
Please choose the |1 parakeet | ...
Here s my |0 reason | .....
|0 I | did the same |1 thing | |1 that | |0 you | did for christmas .
|0 I | ended up getting a |1 pair | of zebra finches for christmas .
At first |0 it | was all cool and all .
|0 They | were chirping and doing their every day |1 business | .
After a couple of weeks |0 I | got tired of them .
|0 They | are quite messy and |0 you | can not hold or pet |1 them | .
|0 I | ve tried to tame |1 them | and they just would not get tamed .
|0 They | do nt want to be held or touched .
|0 I | want a |1 bird | |1 that | |0 I | can hold and do |1 tricks | .
|0 I | still have |1 them | and |0 they | are doing well .
A couple of months after |0 I | got parakeets / |1 budgies | .
|0 They | are adorable |0 they | have beautiful |1 colors | and personality .
|0 I | love |1 them | .
First of all |0 they | are very tame .
|0 I | tamed |1 them | in 4 days .
|0 They | can do |1 tricks | and |0 they | are nt messy .
The whole |0 family | loves |1 them | .
My |0 parents | even plays with them .
|0 They | are a big part of our family .
|0 I | hope |0 this | helps |1 you | with your decision .
|0 They | are both about the same noise level .
When choosing a |1 parakeet | look for a young one .
"( the younger the eaiser to tame ) Look for clean smooth feathers , beak , and clean vent feathers ( the feathers around the butt .. dirty vent |0 feathers | means the |0 bird | is not healthy ) Look for a dark eye with no circles ( the older |0 ones | have a circle |1 ring | in their eyes ) ."
Look for a lot of stripes in their head |0 that | starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird .
the |0 stripes | are like hair the less stipes the older .
( think of a balding man lol ) Look for clean feathers .
If |0 you | want a |1 boy | the |0 cere | ( the nostrils piece above the beak ) must be blue .
The |0 girl | has either |1 pink | or brown .
|0 I | would recommend that |0 you | get two |1 parakeets | .
"But get either one |1 male | and one female , or two males ."
Do not get two |1 females | .
"|0 They | sometimes do nt get along ( |0 you | know how some |0 girls | are lol hahahaahh but for real though , two |0 girls | tend to fight a lot ."
|0 I | have one yellow |1 girl | and a green and yellow boy .
|0 They | are the best !
If |0 you | choose to get a |1 parakeet | |0 this | is a trick |1 that | |0 I | used to tame |1 them | .
"However if |0 you | plan on getting |1 one | , then get more than |1 one | at the same time |0 they | need |1 company | ."
My |0 mom | told |1 me | how to tame |1 them | and |0 I | was very happy with the results .
It took |2 me | 4 |1 days | to get the new |1 one | to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
|0 These | are the steps |0 I | used .
Honestly |0 they | have worked for me twice with my parakeets .
Hopefully |0 they | will work for you .
"1 ) When |0 you | get the |1 bird | , place |1 him | or her or them in the cage ."
Leave |1 them | in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours .
2 ) Then place you |1 hand | in the cage .
|0 I | took the |1 cage | and place |1 it | next to the couch .
"Then |0 I | sat on the couch , placed one |1 hand | in the cage , holding a millet |1 spray | ."
"( this way |0 the | will associate your |1 hand | with food , and |0 birds | love |1 food | lol ) Then |0 I | turned on the |1 tv | and watch ."
This way |0 they | will see that your |0 hand | is good and |0 it | s not going to grab |1 them | or hurt |1 them | .
Do |1 this | for about one hour .
( |0 you | can take |1 breaks | if |0 you | have too ) and repeat the |1 steps | after about 2 hours .
"3 ) After about day 2 , |0 they | will start to eating the millet |1 spray | from your hand ."
"( do not take away the food |1 dish | from the birds , |0 they | will associate |1 you | as the person |0 who | takes away their |1 food | ) ...."
"Then take your |1 finger | and place |1 it | under their belly , in front of their feet and say up ."
Push you |1 finger | to their feet gently and say up .
( the first couple of times |0 they | will fly all over the cage but as long as |0 you | do nt jump back or screem |0 they | will get used to you ) |0 They | will have no |1 choice | but to go on your finger .
"When |0 they | see that |0 you | ar nt harming |1 them | , |0 the | will go up on your finger when |0 you | say up ."
4 ) If |0 they | are not going up by now |0 you | just got ta keep trying and keep trying .
"Do not hit , yell , or harm |1 them | ."
|0 You | have |1 patience | .
Do nt give up !
"After a couple of weeks |0 mines | knows when |0 I | say shoulder |0 it | means ot go on my sholder , when |0 I | say up |0 it | means to jump up on my finger , when |0 I | say up and out |0 it | means up on my finger and out of the cage ."
and when |0 I | say go home |0 it | means to go in the cage .
Good luck !
|0 They | worked for me and |0 I | hope |0 they | worked for you !
|0 They | are awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And |0 that | s my reason why |0 you | should choose a |1 parakeet | over a finch .
a |0 parakeet | is friendlier
Parakeet .
|0 They | are normally quiet and it is easy to take |1 care | of them .
|0 They | are also friendly .
|0 I | have a |1 parakeet | named Cookie . :P
When is the best |0 time | to travel to Ireland ?
My |0 sister | and I would like to go to Ireland .
"|0 I | graduate in the spring , and so |0 we | 'd like to go between then and winter ."
"|0 We | do n't want too many |1 tourists | , and since |0 we | 'll both be out of school |0 we | can go anytime between the middle of June to early November ."
"|0 We | do n't want |1 it | to be too cold ( not sure when exactly there |0 fall | is ... or what the |0 weather | is really like there during our autumn months ) , but |0 we | do n't feel like |0 we | need to go right in the middle of summer either ."
|0 We | 're both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful |1 country | while |0 we | 're still young and before our |0 lives | start to get even crazier !
Can |0 anyone | give |2 me | an |1 idea | of when the best |0 time | for |0 us | to go to Ireland would be ?
"|0 People | do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , |0 it | is unpredictable ."
One thing |0 you | can be sure of about Irish weather is how little |0 you | can be sure of .
"|0 It | may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February , but winter woollies in March and even during the summer ."
And then there ’s the |0 rain | .
"|0 Ireland | receives a |1 lot | of rain , with certain |0 areas | getting a |1 soaking | as many as 270 days of the year ."
County |0 Kerry | is the worst affected .
"The |0 southeast | is the driest , enjoying a more continental |1 climate | ."
"The Irish |0 weather | works on the ‘ four seasons in a day ’ principle , |0 which | basic­ally means that |0 you | ca n’t predict a |1 thing | when it comes to the behaviour of the sky ."
"Some basic assumptions , however , can be made ."
"In summer , from May to July , the |0 days | are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long : at the height of summer |0 you | wo n’t need to turn on |1 lights | until after 10 pm ."
"|0 It | is also peak tourist season , |0 which | means there are far more |0 people | just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and |0 prices | are at their highest ."
"Not surprisingly , |0 most | of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take |1 advantage | of the crowds and the more favourable weather ."
"|0 Spring | ( February to April ) and Autumn ( August to October ) make good |1 alternatives | , although the country ’s ever - growing |0 popularity | as a tourist destination can often blur the |1 lines | between mid - and high - season tourism ."
"Still , |0 you | have a better |1 chance | of some peace and quiet , and the |0 weather | can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid-July – again , |0 it | ’s all part of the uncertainty principle ."
Spring |0 festivities | include the ever - popular St Patrick ’s |1 Festival | .
"Although |0 temperatures | do not often venture below freezing , |0 winter | ( December to February ) can be brutal , for huge parts of the country – the west and northwest in particular ."
"|0 Crowds | are at their thinnest , but |0 many | of the country ’s tourist attractions and services close down in October and do n’t reopen until Easter , |0 which | paradoxically leaves |1 visitors | with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : |0 it | ’s cold , grey and dark by 5 pm , but there ’s always a |0 pub | to escape into when the |0 rain | starts sheeting down ."
"The |0 thing | to do is to bring the right |1 clothing | with you , clothes so |0 you | can layer up if |0 it | is cold and take off |1 layers | when |0 it | warms up ."
Waterproof |0 clothing | and footwear are essential plus an umbrella ..
"As that famous |0 Scotsman | Billy Connolly says "" there is no such |0 thing | as bad weather just the wrong clothes """
"Afraid |0 I | can not be more helpful , |0 it | is really a case of pot luck , although as the |0 weather | is so changeable often a cold wet |0 morning | will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa ."
If |0 you | mean the |1 Republic | of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime .
The |0 summer | there is much more mild than most of the US ( are |0 you | coming from the US ? ) .
Their |0 seasons | are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but |0 I | would suggest |1 fall | .
|0 It | does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet .
September for example .
Rent a |1 car | and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the |1 countryside | and |0 you | will have the |1 trip | of a lifetime .
"To explore the beautiful |1 countryside | |0 you | will need to be old enough to hire a |1 car | because public |0 transport | is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns / cities , most rural |0 places | do n't have a bus or train |1 service | ."
|0 You | could stay in a city & get a bus |1 tour | to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but |0 you | will be with all the other tourists .
By definition most |0 tourists | will go to the best places so |0 you | might have to put up with a few tourists along the way .
Best |0 weather | the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but |0 it | can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .
"|0 We | only had a few sunny |1 days | this summer , barely 24 C on a few occasions , more like 14 C most days ."
|0 We | used our |1 BBQ | on precisely 4 occasions .
|0 Autumn | is from mid August onwards as far as the |0 weather | goes if not officially according to the calender .
"The |0 days | start to shorten & |0 it | gets even wetter , windier & colder ."
"|0 We | had |1 frosts | in October so |0 I | would n't advise visiting late in the year to be honest , Spring |0 time | is your best bet ."
|0 You | do realise it is quite expensive to visit |1 Ireland | ?
"|0 You | are going to need a few thousand |1 dollars | saved up for flights , insurance , food , accommodation & spending money ."
Eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to America |0 I | believe .
Golden Wonder KilliFish Breeding Help ?
|0 I | have 4 Golden Wonder |1 Killifish | .
|0 1 | of them is really colorful and is about 6 cm long .
|0 2 | of them are kinda whitish and are about 4 - 5 cm long .
The last |0 one | is colourful too but |0 it | is about 4 cm long .
"|0 I | feed |2 them | |1 Flakes | , and Live Earthworms uncut everyday ."
Can |0 you | tell |2 me | the whole |1 process | of breeding |1 them | and taking |1 care | of the babies ?
Thanks in Advance .
Wow !
"If |0 they | are able to take |1 earthworms | uncut , |0 that | is really impressive !"
"|0 I | aspire to your feeding regime , flakes early and something live later in the day ."
"|0 Worms | ( and Daphnia ) are also rich in Lipids , substances important in forming |1 eggs | and growing |1 young | ."
|0 I | think that |0 you | understand that your largest and smallest golden |0 wonders | are males .
If |0 you | would like |1 more | on sexing out Aplocheilus |1 lineatus | take a |1 look | at the discussion in the first source below .
If |0 you | have |1 plants | in your tank .
your |0 lineatus | are already spawning .
"If |0 conditions | are favorable ( 78 - 82 F ) and the fish are obviously well fed as |0 yours | are , |0 they | will spawn ."
( |0 I | 've even had a |1 pair | of killies leave |1 eggs | on a floating thermometer !
If |0 you | wish to pick |1 eggs | make a acrylic spawning |1 mop | .
Check out the second |1 source | .
"|0 I | prefer darker |1 colors | because |0 I | can see their |1 eggs | , more easily and the |0 fish | look better next to them ."
"Use a well rinsed medicine |1 vial | , a cork , new fishing bobber or even a piece of non-crumbly styrofoam to float |1 them | ."
"There are a couple |0 ways | |0 one | could spawn |1 lineatus | - mop spawning & water incubating |1 them | for two weeks , picking |1 eggs | from a mop & putting |1 them | in a tray of treated , seasoned water or setting up the |1 parents | in a planted tank & moving |1 them | so the |0 fry | can hatch out there ."
"If |0 you | have the |1 room | to separate the |1 male | ( s ) & females ( s ) , & feed |1 them | well on live foods , ( assuming that |0 you | are doing weekly 50 % water |1 changes | ) when |0 you | put |1 them | together |0 they | will leave a lot more |1 eggs | ."
"Just making up |1 examples | , but if a |0 pair | is constantly together , |0 they | may lay 10 - 15 |1 eggs | a day ."
"With extra blackworms and maybe frozen ( defrosted , rinsed ) frozen foods earlier in the day , |0 they | may leave 30 - 40 |1 eggs | at a time ."
"Separated and feed extremely nourishing |1 stuff | , |0 they | may produce |1 more | ."
Separating a |1 pair | some time before a show ( killies are usually shown & judged & often sold as pairs ) will encourage |1 them | to court and show their best |1 colors | .
|0 They | also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins .
The water |0 changes | help with that too .
|0 You | also may need to treat the incubation |1 water | .
The |0 chlorine | and ammonia ( choramine ) are not good for the eggs .
Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked |1 eggs | in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic |1 critters | |0 that | ride in with the eggs .
"THEN put the |1 eggs | in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe "" ."
Leaving a |1 jar | with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult 's |1 desire | for snacks and |0 they | are more likely to leave |1 fry | or eggs alone .
If a |0 pair | is n't leaving |1 eggs | ... check the |1 following | :
1 . Is a tank |0 mate | ( such as another female killie or a Cory or large snails ) rating the |1 eggs | ?
2 . Have |0 we | kept up with partial water changes ?
3 . Is there too much |0 mineral | in the water ?
Aplo. lineatus are wide - spread over southern India .
|0 That | indicates that |0 they | thrive in different water chemistries .
"Still if |0 you | can get your pet |1 shop | to do a hardness or TDS ( total Dissolved Solids ) |1 test | , |0 that | may give |2 you | a |1 hint | ."
"Winging |1 it | a little here , a |0 hardness | of 100 to nearly 200 PPM ( parts per million ) or 5.8 to 10.6 DH should be fine for gardneri ."
TDS meters ( the thrifty aquarist 's hardness meter can be used if |0 one | has seen |1 one | of your municipal water department 's annual reports .
"|0 They | include a |1 number | of minerals there and |0 you | can figure out what |0 percentage | of that would be your hardness minerals ( calcium , magnesium and iron ) ."
A |0 number | of minerals are not of much consequence .
However if there is a high |0 level | of sodium chloride ( common salt ) |0 that | can break down the |1 chorion | ( shell ) around the egg and allow |1 critters | to get in and eat the |1 yoke | and embryo . )
Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked |1 eggs | in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic |1 critters | |0 that | ride in with the eggs .
"THEN put the |1 eggs | in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe "" ."
"If |0 you | get |1 eggs | in the mail in a medicine vial , |0 that | is fine ."
"But get the |1 eggs | out , maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water ."
In time the |0 eggs | can suffocate in the shipping container .
"After a |0 number | of people began complaining about "" mystery deaths "" among incubating eggs , |0 some | of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7 - 8 days of incubation , |0 one | should do a 100 % water |1 change | - as the |0 eggs | develop , |0 they | do release waste |1 material | ."
Another |0 problem | is that sometimes bad |0 eggs | will fungus and the |0 fungus | will spread out and kill all the |1 eggs | .
"Some |0 people | put in a very dilute Acriflaven |1 solution | to slow down the |1 fungus | , so |0 one | can take white |1 eggs | out with a pipette or eyedropper ."
|0 Other | will add a |1 drop | of Methylene blue .
"If an |0 egg | turns blue , |0 it | had died and then became dyed as the outer |0 membrane | broke down ."
Get |1 those | out ASAP too .
Hope there is useful |0 grist | for the mill here .
Disney cruise line with young ones ?

What is the best |0 time | of year ?
Should |0 I | get a |1 balcony | ?
Any tips or advice to make |1 this | a great experience ??
Thanks !!!
|0 It | is vacation time .
Many |0 families | are set to plan a best |1 holidaying | .
"|0 They | look for fun filled , rejuvenating and memorable vacation ."
There can be many |0 ideas | ; |0 one | can see numerous |1 options | passing through their mind .
What is the best |0 option | ?
"Especially if |0 you | are planning to spend couple |1 days | with family and kids , which best |1 suit | |0 you | can select ?"
"Disney |0 cruises | , is a simple answer to this ."
There are many |0 reasons | to say Disney |0 cruise | is the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday |1 tour | .
"From 1998 onwards , from its inception Disney |0 cruise | has attracted |1 many | and continue to attract |1 more | and more ."
"|0 This | is a spectacular ship , a very popular choice of families to spend their leisure |1 time | ."
"The ship is designed thematically , with imposing animated cartoon characters ."
Do |0 you | feel that the |0 holidaying | with the animated cartoons will impress only young |1 ones | ?
"No , the luxurious |0 facilities | and fun filled activities in the Disney cruise are very attractive to people of all ages ."
"Whatever be the |0 age | , |0 you | will have the |1 choice | of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day - to - day activities ."
Kids fun games and video shows are added to the other facilities .
"There are two |0 ships | , Disney magic and Disney wonder ."
Both are made keeping in mind the |1 comforts | of the travelers .
"Disney |0 cruises | offer 24 - hour room |1 services | , and the |0 crews | are ready to serve |2 you | the |1 way | |0 you | like ."
"|0 It | has got very spacious |1 rooms | , furnished completely and neatly ."
These are decorated uniquely and marvelously .
"The |0 ship | offers |1 variety | of eatables , deliciously made ."
"Sea |0 fishes | , prawns and many nice options are there in different restaurants aboard ."
There are many good |0 options | of delicious food on the shores as well .
There are special |0 regions | uniquely and imposingly designed for the children .
|0 They | can spend many |1 hours | enjoying the Disney world |1 magic | .
These theme |0 parks | have all |1 types | of facilities .
"Video shows , cartoon stories , wonderful games and many such facilities ."
|0 It | is really an entertainment for the kids .
The amusing |0 world | of cartoons and stories will be a memorable experience for the children .
There are other |0 amnesties | also .
"|0 These | include |1 space | for dances and music , bar facility , gambling facilities for the elder , spaciously made open area aboard and many such nice facilities ."
Also |0 one | can keep their |1 privacy | in the cabins and make the |1 time | in seclusion .
To relax and to rejuvenate Disney |0 cruise | are the best option .
There are many online |0 sites | offering the booking |1 facility | with affordable rates .
|0 You | can select the proper |1 route | and travel plans by consulting the |1 agents | prior to the booking ........
"Off |0 season | is good , however , the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked ."
"|0 I | would suggest a warmer |1 season | , but not Spring Break or early summer ."
|0 You | may also want to avoid Thanksgiving |1 week | and the Christmas holidays .
"|0 We | REALLY enjoyed our |1 balcony | -- coffee in the mornings , drinks at night , standing outside when docking and leaving |1 port | -- however , |0 it | is quite a bit more expensive ."
"With young ones , |0 I | would definitely get a |1 window | or view room so |0 they | can see outside ."
Check out the kids ' |1 space | as soon as |0 you | get onboard .
Do NOT feel guilty about taking |1 them | there .
"|0 They | have a |1 BLAST | so the sooner |0 they | get there , the sooner |0 they | can have |1 fun | ."
"|0 We | liked getting the late dinner |1 seating | , so |0 you | have more |1 time | to see |1 movies | and stuff but if your |0 kids | are ' early to bed ' |0 you | may want the earlier |1 seating | for dinners ."
Bring some |1 sort | of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door .
|0 All | of the doors tend to look alike and having ' |1 something | ' on your door helps |1 you | and your kids find your |1 room | easier .
|0 You | can also leave |1 notes | for the rest of your family ( husband ) about where |0 you | are at any given point .
Cell |0 phones | do NOT work on board but |0 they | give |2 you | a ' walkie - talkie ' |1 kind | of phone in your room |0 that | WILL work onboard .
Each evening |0 you | will get a ' |1 magazine | ' called The Navigator |0 which | lists |1 all | of the activities for the next day .
|0 We | always took |1 ours | to dinner and discussed what |1 things | |0 we | felt |0 we | ' had ' to do and which |1 ones | |0 we | felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling .
Any |0 time | would be great .
off season |0 cruises | might actually be better with preschoolers as |0 prices | might be lower in the off season .
"My |0 wife | and I , in our 60's at the time , originally planned a 3 generation |1 trip | but some family |0 emergencies | caused |1 everyone | else to cancel ."
|0 We | had a |1 ball | .
|0 We | had an inside |1 cabin | and |0 it | is what |0 I | would recommend .
There are so many |0 things | to do that |0 you | will only use your |1 room | for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted .
The children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so |0 you | can have a |1 bit | of free time without the little ones .
The range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water |1 activities | .
There is a splash |0 fountain | ( no standing water ) for little ones still in diapers ; Next is a wading |0 pool | for those who are potty trained ; Then a family pool ; Finally there is a |0 pool | for adults only with |0 kids | not allowed .
|0 You | will never be so spoiled in your life as |0 you | are on a Disney Cruise .
"If |0 you | stay with your dining schedule , every |0 night | is dinner and a show ."
The real payoff is that |0 you | will have the same |1 waiter | for the entire cruise .
Our |0 waiter | quickly grasped the |1 fact | that |0 I | like Ginger |1 ale | and rather spicy foods while my wife 's |0 taste | ran to lemonade and less spicy fare .
"Since |0 they | knew our |1 preferences | , |0 we | almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry |0 we | did ."
Obviously |0 they | had a full beverage |1 list | including |1 alcohol | for adults |0 who | wanted |1 it | .
"If |0 you | should miss a |1 meal | , |0 you | also missed a great |1 show | ."
but |0 food | is always available and |0 it | is consistently good .
|0 I | think |0 I | gained three |1 pounds | in my week long cruise .
"|0 This | is about my farrier , girls ."
|0 That | 's why |0 I | 'm posting here !
Help ?
"|0 I | posted |1 this | in singles and dating too , so |0 I | 've just copied and pasted ."
"Well , |0 I | 'll try to make |1 this | short ."
"|0 I | have known this |1 guy | for a long time , but |0 we | 've never been good friends or anything ."
|0 He | is my farrier ( shoes my horse s |1 feet | ) so |0 I | am technically a client if |0 you | want to view |1 it | that way .
"Well , almost two weeks ago |0 he | came out and did my horse s |1 feet | and was SO flirty ."
"|0 He | always hugs |1 me | when |0 he | comes , but |0 he | gave |2 me | at least 5 tight , long , back rubbing |1 hugs | while |0 he | was there ."
|0 We | were also just talking about my horse 's crappy feet and |0 he | mentioned .
""" Well , if |0 you | ever just want to see |1 me | |0 I | 'll come out and look |1 him | over and then |0 we | can grab a |1 coffee | after . """
|0 That | has NEVER happened before so |0 I | was kinda realizing at that point that |0 he | was a little interested .
Right ??
"Anyway , so |0 he | ended up leaving one |1 nail | out of my horse s foot ( |0 I | 've never heard of a |0 farrier | doing |1 this | ) and telling |2 me | to call |1 him | in a few days ( first |0 it | was a week , then |0 it | was a few days lol ) and |0 he | 'd come back out and put |1 it | in ."
|0 He | told |2 me | to remember to call like 3 times before |0 he | left .
"So , |0 I | waited a week to call because |0 I | was busy and |0 I | wanted to have |1 him | come out on a day when |0 I | am more available in case |0 we | were to hang out after ;)"
"Anyway , so |0 that | was 2 days ago that |0 I | called and left a |1 message | , but |0 he | still has n't called back yet ."
|0 I | do n't know if |0 I | should call |1 him | again tomorrow or not ?
"|0 I | know a |0 lot | of people say to wait until |0 he | calls |1 you | , but |0 it | 's different because |0 I | 'm a client and technically |0 that | 's all |0 I | am at this point ."
"On the other hand though , if |0 I | 'm a client |0 he | should really of called back by now because |0 you | do n't leave a |1 customer | hanging ."
|0 He | did n't have my |1 number | either because |0 this | was the first time |0 I | 've called |1 HIM | instead of his dad .
|0 It | 's a father and son business .
"Anyway , |0 I | would appreciate ANY |1 insight | on this at all ."
Thank |1 you | for reading if |0 you | did ! :)
"Ok , well as far as |0 him | being a bad farrier for leaving a |1 nail | out - |0 That | is not the case , |0 they | are extremely well known farriers in the area ."
|0 I | would be a lot more concerned if the |0 shoe | fell off because |0 it | was missing one lousy |1 nail | .
"The |0 reason | |0 he | said |0 he | did n't put that |1 nail | in was because |0 he | "" did n't want to risk |1 it | "" with my horse 's horrible feet ."
|0 This | is about the fourth time |0 they | 've done my horse 's |1 feet | because |0 I | just switched back to them .
The only |0 reason | |0 I | switched away from them in the first place is because my good |0 friend | |0 who | apprenticed with them was starting out on his own .
"However , |0 he | left my |1 horse | without a shoe for TWO WEEKS ( now |0 that | 's |1 what | |0 I | call a crap farrier ) ."
"|0 Which | , |0 I | might add is the same foot |0 that | keeps crumbling with the nails ."
"So , obviously |0 I | switched back to these guys ."
"Ok , calm down , |0 it | 's not like |0 he | 's some stranger |0 that | came up and groped |1 me | lol ."
|0 I | 've known the |1 guy | for about 10 years .
"|0 I | am 21 , so yeah |0 we | were both kids when |0 we | knew each |1 other | !"
|0 He | is a few years older than me .
"And yes , |0 I | do like |1 him | ."
"To answer |1 Barry | White , yes |0 that | did occur to me :) |0 I | hope |0 that | is all |0 he | 's waiting for ."
"On the other hand , |0 he | could very easily just call |1 me | and say hey |0 I | 'm busy right now , |0 I | 'll call |1 you | when |0 I | can come out ."
"And as far as scheduled |0 visits | go , |0 I | have no |1 idea | ."
|0 I | 've never done |1 that | before though either .
"|0 It | 's always just "" Okay , they're |0 feet | need to be done , better call the |1 farrier | . """
And |0 they | usually come out within a few days .
|0 He | will call |1 you | back |0 I | m sure !
Sounds like |0 He | really likes |1 you | ..
But |0 you | need to ask |1 yourself | do |0 you | feel the same |1 way | ?
would |0 You | like going for * coffee * with him ?
or is |0 he | Not your type ?
Or are |0 you | undecided ?
If |0 i | were you |0 I | would Go ...
|0 I | would say if |0 he | does not call |1 you | back by friday call |1 him | again |0 he | could be playing hard to get ?
|0 I | think |0 he | left the |1 Nail | out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see |1 you | hey |0 he | may be your Prince charming ..
Edit ... |0 I | really do nt think Your |0 horse | Is in danger Of being hurt With one |0 Nail | missing ..
|0 I | have seen |0 horses | Loose |1 Nails | On there Own And do just fine with ONE |0 nail | gone Now if |0 he | had left out |1 2 | or 3 |0 I | would be wondering to ...
|0 I | really do belive |0 he | left the |1 nail | out becuse of the horse s Hoof condition and |0 It | s a added bonus |0 he | would get to see |1 her | again
When |0 I | was Younger In my early 20s My |0 farrier | was A hottie named Joby .. ( for those |0 who | do n't Know |0 I | AM A GIRL read my |1 Bio | on my Page ) dumb as a post about everything But horses ..
|0 He | was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 |1 kids | .. but |0 we | both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither |0 one | of us took the |1 chance | and Asked to other on a date . :(
sort a wonder what |0 it | would have been like ?
But |0 That | was Years ago .
|0 He | had this |1 Habit | of telling |2 you | |1 Everything | ..
Well one day |0 he | said to me |0 You | know |0 i | do n't wear |1 Underwear | as he was bent over Working on my Mare s Right front hoof .. and |0 I | was Like Ummmm okay ???
|0 I | m glad his |0 butt | was facing |1 me | so |0 he | could n't see my red |1 face | |0 I | think my |0 Mare | was even laughing ..
Well 6 weeks Later when |0 he | came back out |0 He | was again working on my mare s front Foot and |0 I | looked Down and Yeah |0 he | had |1 Wholes | In his pants In the wrong places |0 I | bust out Laughing and |0 He | was like what ???
|0 I | was like Ummmm |0 i | can see your ass |1 cheeks | ... |0 he | was like Oops did |0 i | forget my |1 Underwear | ???
|0 that | was a strange way to flirt .. but |0 i | guss |0 it | was his way ...
But like |0 i | said |0 nothing | ever came of It .. the next time |0 I | saw |1 him | |0 He | had told |2 Me | |0 he | had To get married to a girl Who |0 he | worked with becuse |0 he | knocked |1 Her | Up ..
|0 I | was heartbroken .. but then realized |0 He | was not the Guy for me ..
"Wow |0 he | does sound interested in you , my |0 farrier | never gives |2 me | |1 hugs | like that ( probably a good thing as |0 he | has a |1 wife | and 2 kids ) anyway , |0 I | find that |0 they | can be very busy so |0 I | would wait a |1 week | lo9nger and if still no reply give |2 him | a |1 call | but do n’t leave a |1 message | so |0 you | do n’t have to necessarily wait for |0 him | to call ."
"From the point of view of a business , and client / operator relationships , |0 he | 's doing a really shitty |1 job | ."
Leaving |1 nails | out so |0 you | 'll call and have |0 him | come back out later ?
"Cute or not , |0 I | 'd call a different |1 bloke | because |0 he | 's doing a sub-par |1 job | at something |0 he | needs to be doing his |1 best | at , whether |0 he | 's flirting or trying to ask |1 you | out or not , |0 he | ought to put |1 quality | first ."
"|0 This | is , after all , his business , and if |0 he | wants |1 you | to remain a customer why on earth is |0 he | doing shoddy |1 work | ?"
"EPM , |0 Anyone | Dealt with it ?"
Might be something different ?
|0 I | have the |1 opportunity | to pick up a super nice 6 year |1 old | for free .
"|0 He | 's not lame , but |0 he | 's been having |1 issues | ."
Here 's |0 what | the |0 owner | has said :
|0 I | have a 5 year |1 old | |0 that | lost |1 all | of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .
"|0 I | chalked |1 it | up to possible nerve damage , because |0 this | is what the |0 vet | thought and the other cheek |0 muscle | was fine and |0 he | had no theeth |1 problems | ."
So |0 I | sent |1 him | to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels .
|0 I | got |1 him | back the first of the month and |0 he | had lost some |1 weight | but attributed |1 that | to be worked everyday ( |0 I | expected |1 him | to drop |1 some | ) .
|0 He | is now losing the cheek |1 muscle | on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping |1 weight | by the day .
Had |1 him | to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth |0 problems | .
"|0 He | can eat all his |1 feed | and does n't drop |1 any | , but can not eat |1 hay | from lack of muscle to chew |1 it | ."
|0 He | is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline |1 muscle | .
The only neurological |0 sign | |1 that | |0 he | shows is that |0 he | barely drags his |1 toes | and sometimes has |1 trouble | with his right lead .
The |0 horse | |0 I | had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life .
|0 I | CAN NOT afford to treat |0 whatever | is wrong with him .
"NO , |0 I | have not done an EPM |1 test | but have done an extensive blood |1 panel | and my |0 vet | did a neurological physical |1 exam | ."
|0 We | elected to not do the EPM |1 test | because there was NO neurological |0 signs | .
"|0 He | is still showing no |1 signs | other than the weight loss , and some muscle atrophy ."
|0 He | eats |1 all | of his grain but |0 it | just takes |1 him | a while to get |1 it | chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws .
So |0 I | might get the |1 horse | and see |1 what | |0 I | can do .
"|0 I | will be getting with my vet first and if |0 I | do get |1 him | , have the spinal fluid |1 test | done for EPM and a titer test ."
Will be getting a |1 copy | of the blood results the |0 owner | has already ran as well .
My other |0 theory | would be wobblers .
|0 I | 'll be having my equine chiro / |1 acupuncturist | out to do some |1 work | as well if |0 I | do get |1 him | ....
So any ideas ?
Think |0 I | should do |1 it | ?
"Arby ,"
|0 Horse | is out of state and not local .
|0 Owner | is willing to meet |1 me | half way with him .
|0 I | will be calling my |1 vet | and chiro about him .
"|0 Worse | comes to worse , |0 I | 'm out of the $ $ and have to put |1 him | down anyway or have a pretty pasture |1 ornament | ."
|0 He | 's still rideable currently and not having many |1 issues | under saddle .
|0 This | is a horse |1 that | |0 I | otherwise would n't be able to afford and even if |0 I | spend 2 |1 K | and treatment |0 I | come out ahead of his purchase price .
"|0 I | posted |1 what | the |0 owner | as said in paragraph 2 & 3 , |0 that | is not me to clarify ."
|0 She | is the one |0 that | ca n't afford to do |1 anything | else for him in case |0 he | does n't recover fully .
|0 He | can eat |1 grain | and |0 I | already have a feed |1 regimen | in my head for the guy since |0 he | ca n't eat regular |1 hay | .
|0 I | do n't think it will be hard to keep his |1 weight | up so long as |0 he | can eat the |1 grain | .
|0 I | am not going to go pick up a |1 horse | |0 I | ca n't afford .
|0 I | am willing to pull the EPM |1 test | and treat .
The |0 owner | is the one |0 who | is unable .
|0 I | will also be having my other |1 vet | up |0 who | 's a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate |1 him | for wobblers .
|0 July | is when |0 he | started to exhibit slight |1 symptoms | and the |0 owner | and vet originally thought |0 it | was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .
"|0 He | 's only exhibited weight |1 loss | and some muscle atrophy , with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead ( |0 which | could or could n't be related ) ."
The |0 horse | is not in pain .
|0 He | 's not starving .
|0 He | 's dropping |1 we |
The |0 horse | is not in pain .
|0 He | 's not starving .
"|0 He | 's dropping |1 weight | , but |0 most | of that came from being at the trainer s and being ridden hard for 60 days ."
|0 He | 's not putting |1 it | back on .
|0 I | know that |0 I | have the |1 possibility | of treating |1 him | and still having to put |1 him | down .
At the same time |0 I | do know |1 people | |0 who | have had |1 horses | come back successfully after EPM .
|0 I | know |0 this | is going to be expensive .
|0 I | 'm willing to give |2 it | a |1 shot | .
"Gallop , |0 I | 've already read that whole |1 site | and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well ."
"Looked at studies , treatment options and such ."
|0 I | will have the EPM |1 test | done before treating .
The chiro / |0 acupuncturist | will be there to evaluate the |1 horse | for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM .
If |0 that | is the case then |0 acupuncture | is n't going to hurt |1 him | .
|0 It | 's actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
|0 I | think |0 it | is wonderfully responsible that |0 you | are going into this rescue |1 eyes | open and are getting the |1 opinions | of qualified professionals ( and a bunch of Yahoos ) before |0 you | decide to take this |1 horse | on .
|0 I | do think some Y!A |0 users | need to work on their reading comprehension as |0 I | ca n't comprehend how taking a |1 horse | in as a rescue and getting |2 it | qualified medical |1 treatment | is abuse .
Worst case scenario |0 you | fall in love and after spending |1 thousands | of dollars |0 you | have to put the |1 horse | down .
Is |0 that | something |0 you | are up for ?
If so go for it and |0 I | 'll give |2 you | all the moral |1 support | |0 I | can as |0 you | figure out |0 what | is up .
"It is heartbreaking to try to bring a |1 horse | back and then have to put |1 it | down , but some |0 horses | are worth the |1 risk | ."
If |0 you | feel this |0 guy | is worth |1 it | then |0 I | hope your |0 vet | can figure |1 things | out .
As to EPM like |0 Shee | said being in MI |0 we | 've had to deal with it .
Pretty much every large |0 stable | has here .
Our first diagnosed EPM |0 horse | was |1 back | when there was no |0 treatment | in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada .
|0 We | hauled the |1 horse | to Windsor and got |1 him | treated there .
That |0 horse | returned to racing and |0 we | did n't notice much |1 difference | .
"|0 We | 've had a |1 few | since then , but none since our race |0 horses | began wintering in Florida ."
"|0 I | have no |1 idea | if |0 that | is related or |0 farmers | are doing a better |1 job | of clearing out |1 opossums | now because |0 they | know |0 opossums | are carriers , but |0 we | have n't had an EPM |1 horse | in at least 10 years ."
|0 I | can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when |0 they | were showing mild |1 signs | like |0 Shee | gave and |0 all | returned to racing .
One |0 horse | even got his lifetime |1 mark | after being treated for EPM .
|0 We | 've always liked big long |1 trotters | |0 that | do better on mile tracks then 1 / 2 mile .
The only |0 difference | |0 we | noticed is that the EPM |0 horses | seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after .
|0 It | might just be coincidence or the fact those great big |0 trotters | with those extremely long backs lost a |1 bit | of fine coordination to get those gangly |1 bodies | around those tighter turns .
|0 I | do n't know .
|0 MSU | does a |1 lot | of EPM studies because of how common |0 it | is here .
|0 You | may want to see if |0 you | can get in touch with their EPM group and get this |1 guy | in a study .
|0 I | know |0 they | did lab |1 work | showing that Strongid |0 C | used daily could help prevent |1 EPM | .
"|0 I | believe |0 they | have a real |1 study | testing the lab |1 work | in real world situations now , but |0 it | may be some time before those results are released ."
Another thought with |0 this | being a mosquito season from hell could |0 it | be West Nile ?
West |0 Nile | can cause EPM like |1 symptoms | and does n't always include a |1 fever | .
Let |1 us | know |1 what | |0 you | decide to do .
"|0 You | hate to see |1 talent | get wasted , but honestly |0 I | do n't think |0 I | could take in a |1 horse | right now these issues ."
Personally |0 I | think |0 you | should just keep on walking by .
|0 You | should have you |1 chiro | out before |0 you | decide if |0 you | want this |1 horse | or not .
"If |0 you | have a good |1 repoire | ( |1 which | |0 I | 'm sure |0 you | do ) with them , |0 they | should be honest on if this |0 horse | is fixable to any degree ... not really sure |1 what | |0 you | want to do with him ..."
"Even if |0 you | can figure out |0 what | is wrong with this poor poneh , there is always the |0 chance | for remission and then relapse so |0 you | may have to do deal with again in the future ."
"So all in all , put the |1 money | up front before taking on this horse ."
A few |0 hundred | out of pocket now will possibly save |2 you | |1 thousands | once the |0 horse | is in your name .
Could |0 he | have had a |1 blow | to the head causing this |1 atrophy | ?
Or a difficult birth ?
Was |0 it | always like this ?
Or has |0 it | occurred since birth .
|0 I | also wonder if |0 he | might have had a slight |1 stroke | ?
|0 I | think if |0 you | can not afford to get |1 him | treated that |0 you | should not consider |1 him | as a prospect .
"|0 Who | knows |1 what | the |0 future | might hold , and |0 it | might be expensive ?"
Extremely bad customer service
"Do not go to this salon , especially if |0 you | have to get your |1 hair | straightened ."
|0 They | did a very bad |1 job | with my hair and were extremely rude when |0 I | went back to ask |1 them | why |0 it | did n't work for my hair .
"Rude , insensitive , discourteous people !!!!!"
Great Doc
|0 Dr | Greenwalt fixed my |1 neck | from a snowboard injury and was way more effective that a regular doctor .
"|0 He | did nt prescribe pain |1 meds | or other drugs , |0 he | used his bodytalk |1 method | |0 which | is unusual but the |0 results | are undeniable ."
My |0 neck | is fixed !.
|0 He | knows |1 what | |0 he | s doing .
Our Wedding 11/7/08
|0 We | just had our |1 wedding | on 11/7/08 and was very impressed .
|0 Cj | and company did |1 all | |1 that | |0 we | ask and 10 times more .
The |0 food | was out standing .
If |0 you | need a |1 cater | |0 that | is affordable and easy to work with |0 they | are the ones .
Thanks again Saucey 's .

Excellent Tattoo Shop
|0 I | recently got a |1 tattoo | done at Aztec and |0 I | could not be happier .
|0 It | came out better than |0 I | even imagined .
"The |0 shop | was great , the |0 service | was excellent and the |0 employees | were fun guys ."
|0 I | would highly recommend this |1 shop | to anyone looking to get a quality |1 tattoo | done .
Good and Bad
|0 I | had to take |1 care | of the ants myself .
But |0 I | found the |1 location | wonderful and found the neighbors very kind .
Never had a |1 problem | with the staff and found |1 them | very helpful when |0 something | went wrong .
Loved the |1 pool | and BBQ .
Because of the ants |0 I | dropped |1 them | to a 3 star .
Great pet care
|0 I | have used Just Like |1 Family | several times now and |0 they | have provided great |1 care | for my two dogs .

Good beer good service and |1 what | more could |0 you | want .
awful awful awful
This |0 store | is by far the worst Verizon store |0 I | 've been in .
"The |0 salespeople | are never available , the |0 lines | are always too long , and |0 all | the |0 people | want is a sale ."
Incredibly rude and |0 I | will not return to it .
Is there no other |0 Verizon | to go to around Downtown / Dupont Circle 1?!?!?
Great graphic design work !

The |0 artwork | is excellent and the |0 prices | are very reasonable .
|0 I | would recommend this |1 shop | to anyone looking to get a |1 tattoo | .

Excellent customer service and honest feedback .
The |0 team | at Bradley Chevron kept my |1 car | running for well past its expected death !
|0 They | are honest about ' immediate ' concerns versus ' recommended ' repairs and have very fair |1 prices | .
Such a convenient location as well with coffee shop and bradley food and beverage right around corner .
Needs to go out of business
"|0 They | close whenever |0 they | feel like it , often well before their listed closing time ."
"Their |0 store | is dusty , dirty and feels like |0 you | 're stepping into the 1970s ."
|0 They | do n't take |1 coupons | .
|0 They | have a credit card |1 minimum | .
This |0 place | is the opposite of QuikTrip : crappy in every way .
Where else can |0 you | go for $ 10 and recieve this |1 treatment | ?!
Awesome haircut at awesome price right here in Palatine !
|0 Who | can pass up a hot |1 towel | and a straight edge neck shave !
|0 I | 've had 2 |1 cuts | now from Georgia and have paid |1 more | in other salons / barbershops and have not received this |1 kind | of treatment or cut !
Baffled by the one - star reviews
|0 I | do n't get |1 it | .
"This |0 place | is awesome , with a great ambiance and cool décor , and the |0 food | is scrumptious ( and especially their signature banana split ) ."
"Sure , some |0 items | are a little pricey , but c'm on ... have |0 you | ever been out to eat in Seattle before ?"
"|0 I | 've only had good |1 experiences | at Adorn , I was greeted and offered a |1 refreshment | ."

|0 I | always leave loving my hair |1 style | .
Best Chineese food in the area
The |0 food | here is fresh and hot out of the Wok .
The food is cooked fast by the two chefs on duty .
The lunch |0 specials | are more food than most |0 people | can eat for about $ 6 .
"|0 It | is busy every day at lunch for a reason , the |0 service | is fast and the |0 food | is great ."
Pure Pilates !!
|0 It | is the real thing - |0 I | have been practicing |1 Pilates | for over 7 years and would not go anywhere else .
|0 It | is the attention to detail and the quality of the work taught at TomiPilates |0 that | sets this |1 studio | apart from the others .
The teachers are highly trained and are expert at handling all |1 types | of clients .
"|0 I | phoned this |1 company | for advice on our office refurb and although |0 we | did not use |1 them | in the end ( as our building |0 contractor | carried out the electrical |1 work | ) , |0 they | provided |1 me | with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently |0 we | are now using |1 PJC | as our electrical maintenance contractor ."
Thoroughly recommended
|0 They | really go above and beyond !
"For example , |0 I | actually forgot to feed my |1 cat | , and |0 they | went out of their way to take |1 care | of him ."
"Additionally , when there was |0 confusion | ( my fault ) , |0 they | left |2 me | |1 flowers | along with a personalized gift ."
|0 They | have been 100 % reliable and professional .
Definitely recommend !

"Slowest , Unfriendly Sstaff on Weekends"
There are three Starbucks |0 locations | |1 that | |0 I | frequent .
|0 I | have a |1 bit | of experience watching the usual assembly |1 line | .
|0 I | also understand that weekend |0 staffs | are different than daytime staffs and not necessarily Starbucks A - team or even full - time .
But this |0 location | has the worst weekend |1 staff | |0 I | 've seen EVER .
Skip te |1 rest | - |0 this | is the best
Absolutely great !
"Clean , updated room , friendly staff , safe location ."
"|0 Staff | is super friendly , treat |1 you | as a friend ."

"BAD COFFEE , DO NT BOTHER !"
Ca n't |0 you | make a decent |1 cup | of coffee ?
"|0 You | charge SO |1 MUCH | , yet |0 you | use the same |1 grounds | over and over again ."
The |0 coffee | taste BURNT and very bitter .
No |0 amount | of sugar and milk can mask |1 it | .
"CHANGE THE |1 PROCESS | , |1 PPL | !"
"|0 Westfield | and Rt 1 do |1 it | well , WHY CA NT |0 U | ????"
Home made product
|0 I | sometimes go into this store just for something to do on a sunday afternoon .
"|0 I | love the |1 people | , the product and the service !"
|0 Nothing | compares to a home made product |0 that | really stands the |1 test | of time . -
"The |0 Brick | , Ikea , and Leon 's have their |1 place | ."
But |0 furniture | like this will truly be around forever .
The |0 internet | here is terrible .
"Like the previous |0 poster | said , the com lines are split between the entire building ."
|0 That | 's 3 x worse than Qwest DSL 's lowest speed offering !
"The outward |0 appearance | makes |0 you | think this |0 place | is nice , but |0 everything | inside is cheap cheap cheap ."
Moving out as soon as our |0 lease | is up .

Great service .

Great out night !
"|0 You | ca n't go wrong with Tuesday prices , even if |0 you | get quite the mixed |1 bag | of comedians !"
"Extensive drink list and daily specials but wish |0 they | had a bit |1 more | on their food menu , although |0 popcorn | is a nice touch !"
"( other items : chicken fingers , wings , asian pizza , and yam and regular fries )"
Their |0 food | and sweets are awesome .
But |0 service | is very poor .
|0 Attitude | of staff very bad .
Never gives a |1 receipt | .
Sometimes even gives wrong |1 dish | .
So confused at the payment area .
Line |0 up | is so stupid .
Even if |0 you | line up .
To make a |1 order | |0 you | may have to go to back of line .
And then wait again .
Not organised .
|0 Hair | By Nivine in eastgardens fixed my |1 hair | after |0 i | had my |1 hair | cut and colored at another salon |0 i | felt more confident and the |0 girls | are fantastic and |0 i | ve been going there now for 2 years always happy and |0 they | care about my hair had my |1 hair | done for my wedding |0 it | looked fabolous !

Best food in northeast
There s a |0 reason | why Frank mcclelland was named best chef of the north east reigon .
|0 Food | here is absolutely superb .
Everything is delicous and cooked perfectly .
The waiting |0 staff | is beyond impeccable ( |0 they | refold your |1 napkin | when |0 you | go to the bathroom ) .
If |0 you | want great |1 food | then |0 L'espalier | is the place to go .
"|0 I | did n't end up buying my |1 car | here , but |0 I | did think the |0 guy | |0 who | worked with me was pretty cool - |0 he | was willing to budge a little on the price |0 which | means a |1 lot | to me ."
"Also |0 they | will fill your |1 tires | with air and other small maintenance tasks for free , even if |0 you | did n't buy your |1 car | there !"
The Best Deals in Town
"Before |0 you | buy |1 ANYTHING | in NY , make sure |0 you | stop by Jack -s first ."
"Their |0 selection | is random , so |0 what | |0 they | have on a given week might never be available again at the store ."
|0 I | love |1 it | for discounted beauty items and household appliances .
"Trust |1 me | , |0 you | go there once and |0 you | -ll always go back !"
First Time Ballerina
My |0 daughter | is starting |1 ballet | this year for the first time .
|0 I | 'm a soccer mom so |0 I | was n't sure what |0 I | was looking for when |0 it | comes to dancewear .
The |0 staff | was very helpful and gave |1 me | exactly |1 what | |0 I | needed for my first time ballerina .
The |0 service | at Instep was great !!
|0 I | would recommend |1 them | to anyone !
Outstanding service & quality at a very affordable price !
This |0 place | is top notch and highly affordable !
|0 I | would recommend |1 it | hands down and am a loyal customer .
|0 I | 've also sent over a |1 number | of friends to use the |1 services | here and |0 everyone | is extraordinarily pleased !
Thanks for doing such great |1 work | on my important pieces of clothing |0 that | always look great !
Tried |1 Crust | on Broad on 3 occasions .
Twice for dinner and once for lunch Absolutely rude service every time !
The |0 staff | will not even answer the |1 phone | for take out .
"Tonight , |0 I | called several times with no answer ( Btwn 5:30 and 6 pm ) and finally drove there to place my |1 order | in person ."
There was not a |0 customer | to be found .
|0 we | purchased a new |1 home | but was unable to sell our old |1 house | so |0 we | contacted this property management |1 company | and |0 they | have helped |1 us | quickly rent out our |1 house | and keep |1 it | maintained .
Since then |0 we | have decided to have |1 them | manage our other investment |1 properties | as well as |0 we | getting older and can no longer perform all the |1 inquires | .
Great help !
|0 We | just got our |1 sunroom | built by Patio World and can say that |0 I | 'm extremely happy with the whole thing .
"From the amount of time spent with us to explain |1 things | during the initial quote , to the communication through the approval process to the actual workmanship of the build itself ."
|0 I | have |1 nothing | bad to say .
Very glad that |0 we | went with them .
No Customer Service
"|0 Employees | seemed to be having a good |1 time | chatting and laughing with each other , while myself and other customers were completely ignored ."
Another |0 person | in the store stood there with an item and repeatedly tried to get a sales person s |1 attention | .
It was n't until |0 he | gave up and walked out the door that |0 someone | asked Can |0 I | help |1 you | .
do NOT bring your |1 car | here
|0 I | got a |1 coupon | from Pennysaver for this station .
"Yes , |0 they | accepted |1 it | ."
"However , during the test , |0 they | did |1 whatever | |0 they | can to get my |1 test | failed ."
"Then , |0 they | sold |2 me | overpriced |1 stuffs | , such as oil tank cap , so that my |0 car | can pass |1 it | right away ."
|0 I | ended up paying much |1 more | .
Are |0 you | kidding |1 me | ?
|0 I | do n't get |1 it | .
"Spongy and sweet bread ( microwaved ? ) , heartless salsa , tiny dogs ..."
|0 You | order at the counter and there is a |0 space | for tip on your credit card receipt .
The |0 dude | |0 who | grills the retarded |1 dogs | is rude .
"If |0 this | is the best |1 that | |0 Tucson | has to offer , |0 I | am out ta here ..."
|0 I | called on a Friday at 12:30 complaining of a severe toothache .
|0 Dr. | Obina told |1 me | that his |0 office | closed at noon and that |0 I | should call |1 him | on Monday .
|0 I | had been a patient of Dr. Olbina for 9 years and had spent |1 thousands | of dollars on crowns etc .
There are |0 plenty | of good dentists in Fernandina .
Do n't go to Amelia Gentle Dentistry .
Good location
For a hotel like this |0 you | would expect some |1 form | of free internet .
|0 What | |0 you | get is a $ 13 / day charge to access the |1 internet | through a slow 512 / 512 kb / s |1 that | |0 you | can only use to check |1 email | etc ( Read : No |1 downloading | ) .
Other than that the |0 hotel | is in a good location and the |0 breakfast | is great
Make |1 You | Feel Like a Number
Stay away from Kids First West Chester .
|0 You | NEVER get a |1 human | on the phone .
It 's impossible to get an |1 appointment | .
If you get caught in traffic and are a couple minutes late |0 they | make |1 you | re-schedule ... for 6 weeks later .
And worst of all your |0 child | feels like a number not a patient .
Go somewhere else .
"Rcommended by bees , too !"
Highly recommended .
"|0 Joe | removed a wasp |1 nest | for our condominium building and |0 we | appreciated the environmentally friendly |1 method | and prompt , friendly and informative service ."

Too bad |0 they | were out of the Chocolate Lava Cake .
Maybe next time |0 they | will have |1 it | .
|0 Service | was excellent !

Beware of Sharayu
"Hopless service , at the time of booking my |1 car | a lot was promised but delivered not even one |1 tenth | of what was promised ."
Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts |0 I | could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official |1 complaint | .
My |0 advise | to all is |0 I | have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure |0 you | do nt !!!
|0 Course | has come a long |1 way | !!
"HCC 's new |0 nine | was a little shaky at first , but the NEW grounds |0 superintendant | has done |1 wonders | for the course !!"
The |0 comment | below definitely needs to be retracted !
Come back and give |2 HCC | a second |1 chance | at least !
|0 It | is a great course for local |0 golfers | to be proud of and all the |0 comments | in 2008 have been very positive !!
Excellent Physiotherapists !
|0 Kusal | Goonewardena and his team of Physios are unbelievable !
"|0 I | have been suffering from back pain for over 12 years and have been to numerous specialists , physios , osteos and chiros with no help ."
|0 It | took the Vigor |2 team | only 4 |1 visits | to get |1 me | feeling normal !
And now 2 months after my last appointment |0 I | am better than ever .
Thanks guys !
|0 They | must have read these |1 reviews | and improved !

It 's helpful to know a quite a |1 bit | about bull fighting .
If |0 you | watch a |1 lot | of fights ( youtube ) and research |1 some | of the history ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting ) |0 you | will find |1 yourself | enjoying |1 it | a lot more !
"Also after seeing a |1 handful | of bullfights , |0 I | can say that |0 they | 're a lot more enjoyable if |0 you | 're smashed ( |0 BAC | >= |1 .15 | ) ."
|0 All | |0 I | can say is that |0 I | am glad |0 I | went in !
The |0 nurses | are sweet as pie and the |0 doctor | is wonderful .
"This |0 place | is about healing , not making a |1 buck | ."

|0 I | will be back and telling |1 EVERYONE | about this clinic .
THANK |1 YOU | !!
|0 I | just like the |1 fact | that |0 he | was able to do the specific |1 type | of repair |0 I | wanted ( a reball ) and give |2 me | the longest |1 warranty | and even a lower price .
Someone else |0 I | found |0 that | said |0 they | could do |1 it | but wanted to charge |2 me | |1 more | and give |2 me | less |1 warranty | .
|0 It | was a no brainer really .
|0 I | choose Console |1 Pros | and |0 I | 'm happy |0 I | did .
This |0 place | is bad .
"|0 It | 's dark , dingy & dirty ."
"The |0 salads | are limp and the |0 rest | of the food is n't any better ( ok , the |0 nachos | are not too bad ! )"

Ham s on Friendly ... RIP
"|0 This | is the original Ham 's restaurant , expanded into a regional chain in the late 80's -- but this |0 one | is no more ."
Victim of hard times and |0 I | suspect failing corporate management .
"According to news accounts , the |0 company | is struggling ."
|0 I | have many fond |1 memories | of my college evenings there long ago .
So long Ham s ... you will be missed .
|0 We | are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window .
Our window |0 panes | were so dirty that |0 they | needed a |1 specialist | to come and clean |1 them | .
|0 We | called few |1 companies | before |0 we | decide to hire |1 them | .
|0 They | came on time and completed their |1 work | quickly .
|0 We | were very happy how clean looked our |0 windows | .
"If |0 you | have some |1 problems | with your windows , |0 you | should call |1 them | ."
Great help even near closing time !
|0 I | came in to town for a week and forgot my |1 trainers | !
Oh no !!
|0 I | came in 30 min before close and the |0 staff | was super helpful .
|0 They | spent a |1 lot | of time with me and got |1 me | into a great pair of shoes .
|0 I | think |0 they | may even be better than the pair |0 I | have been using this past year !
Thanks Run on !
Great
|0 This | is a perfect place to get your |1 hair | done .
|0 I | have gone there time and time again whenever |0 I | need to get my |1 hair | done or when |0 I | want a |1 haircut | .
"When |0 I | get my |1 hair | done there , |0 they | use enough hairstyling |1 products | while |0 it | does not ruin your |1 hair | ."
"The |0 service | is great and during weekends |0 it | tends to get busy , but the |0 wait | is worthwhile ."
Highly Recommend
|0 I | have worked with Shannon as my massage therapist and intuitive bodyworker for years and have never been disappointed .
"No matter what |1 state | |0 I | am in when |0 I | arrive , |0 I | always leave feeling better ."
"|0 She | has not only helped |1 me | through some challenging computer - work and sports related injuries , |0 she | was wonderful to work with throughout my pregnancy and beyond ."
|0 I | highly recommend |1 her | .
Best Store In Boothbay Harbor
"What a fantastic store , |0 I | love this |1 place | ."
Not the same old stuff |1 that | all the other |0 stores | have .
"Their |0 items | are very unique , great quality , great prices ."
"|0 They | also have the best |1 tea | |0 I | ever had , not at all like the junk |0 you | get at the grocery stores , |0 I | stock up when ever there because |0 they | are closed in the winter ."
The BEST
|0 Dr. | Aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters .
"|0 Dr. | Aster is very kind an gentle with the children , but also positive and to the point with the parents ."
|0 She | is and excellent doctor to have on one 's team .
Even though |0 I | live pretty far from her office |0 I | still make the |1 trip | so my |0 daughters | will have the |1 BEST | !
My |0 wife | and I avoided doing some fairly simple electrical |1 re-wiring | in our home for several years due to overall hassle and cost involved .
|0 I | finally called |1 Matt | from Bonafide and |0 he | made the |1 project | both easy for us and reasonable .
"|0 He | was prompt , knowledgable , friendly , clean and just an overall great guy |0 who | obviously cares about his business ."
|0 I | will reccommend his |1 services | however / whenever possible !
Real pros
|0 I | 've had writer |1 friends | describe horror |1 stories | with their printers .
|0 I | tell |1 them | : why not just go with these guys ?
|0 Richard | Joule and the gang are pros from start to finish .
|0 They | set out to exceed your |1 expectations | .
"Already |0 I | 'm considering future |1 projects | , and |0 I | can assure |1 you | that for my printing needs |0 I | will be choosing no |1 other | than Atlanta Paperback Book Printing ."
|0 I | have been here 3 times and all 3 times |0 it | has been bad !
|0 They | have messed up my |1 order | and .... The |0 food | was just not good !
|0 I | had |1 sonic | in many other palces but for some reason this |0 sonic | is always just covered in grease and not good ... :(
|0 I | hope |0 they | get there |1 act | together ...
|0 I | am going to give |2 it | one last |1 chance | in next few months and see ??
|0 I | called |1 them | for an estimate and |0 they | INSULTED |1 ME | WHEN |0 I | ASK |2 THEM | |1 QUESTIONS | .
|0 THEY | ARE VERY RUDE AND NASTY .
"PLEASE DO N'T USE THIS MOVING |1 COMPANY | IF |0 YOU | DO N'T WANT TO : CRY , HAVE |1 TROUBLE | AND A BAD EXPERIENCE ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE ."
"|0 THEY | WILL GIVE |2 YOU | A LOW |1 PRICE | OVER THE PHONE AND ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE |0 THEY | WILL CHANGE THE |1 PRICE | , |0 I | GUARANTEE |1 IT | ."
|0 You | 've Got |1 Maids | did a fabulous |1 job | cleaning my |1 home | .
|0 I | am hiring |1 them | to come once a week now that |0 they | got my |1 house | to where |0 they | can maintain |1 it | for only an hour and a half every two weeks !
Satisfactory for sure with the sercvice !
"Beats having one "" cleaning |1 lady | "" |0 who | took twice as long and did not do a very through |1 job | like the "" |0 maids | "" did !"
This |0 place | has the best baby and children s |1 clothes | .
Especially high end keep sake sort of clothing |1 that | |0 you | just ca nt find in a lot of stores .
|0 It | is all very unique and |0 you | wo nt find any other |1 baby | wearing the same |1 stuff | .
|0 I | spent quite a |1 bit | because |0 I | spoil my little |1 princess | .
After all |0 she | will only be a baby for so long |0 I | figure why not enjoy |1 it | .
"Antique Lighting , Fixtures , Chicago"
Great place for Antique Lighting !
|0 I | visited their huge Chicago lighting |1 showroom | and |0 all | |0 I | have to say is WOW !!
"Lots of collections , many antique light fixtures , Chandeliers , custom lighting etc ."
|0 I | think |0 they | have the largest |1 collection | for Chandeliers |1 Chicago | .
"Antiques , Vintage , Contemporary & Modern Chandeliers ."
|0 I | would recommend |1 them | for any custom lighting or Lighting Repair and Restoration |1 Chicago |
Great Food Awesome food Awesome service
|0 I | wanted to try |1 someplace | new again .
This |0 place | rocked .
Brought my |1 wife | Deb with me and |0 she | like the Fried Crab |1 Wontons | and said |0 they | were good ..
|0 We | also had the BBQ Spare |1 Ribs | .. good also .
|0 I | ordered the MOO SHU |1 pork | and |0 it | was great ..
|0 I | also ordered the Neptune |1 Platter | |0 which | was awesome ... so this |0 place | gets 5 out of 5 |1 stars | .
DO NOT GO HERE !!!
"|0 I | went to get my |1 nails | filled Friday , by Monday |0 2 | were broken ."
"|0 I | was not happy with the way |0 they | looked , very wavy , uneven edges , and with the exception of 1 , there is a |0 dip | in the center of each nail ."
"|0 I | also had a |1 pedicure | , and |0 they | cut my |1 nails | too short , |0 one | of my big toes looks like |0 it | s getting infected ."
No way .
|0 I | 'm certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of Vietnamese food but |0 I | wanted to try the real |1 things | here at A Dong .
"|0 Cold | , slimy , tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods ."
"Not good , not great , and again another disappointment in Central Iowa ."
How do these |0 places | stay in business .
This |0 town | needs some food |1 soul | and |0 this | is not it .
Worth Every |1 Penny |
"My |0 girlfriend | and I ate at The Grill last night , and our |0 experience | was amazing ."
"Everything |0 we | ordered was prepared to perfection , and was presented perfectly ."
"The |0 asparagus | , seared tuna , and lobster tail were the best |0 we | ever had ."
"Then the |0 desserts | came , and |0 they | were |0 hands | down the best dessert |0 we | ever had ."
"|0 I | will sum |1 it | up with , |0 it | was worth every |1 penny | !"
BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER !!!
|0 It | was the best Chinese food |0 I | have ever had .
"All the |0 food | tasted excellent , and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom , |0 it | is awesome ."
The |0 people | working their are also extremely polite and friendly .
"Every time |0 I | go , |0 Kevin | , the manager , will always remember my |1 family | and I ."
"Overall , |0 it | is very family oriented , and |0 I | recommend |1 it | to everyone !!!"
Furnace repair
Tiger |0 Heating | is awesome .
|0 I | had |1 John | and Dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust |1 motor | replaced .
These |0 guys | were absolutely professional .
|0 John | was here in 45 minutes after |0 I | called on a 10 below zero early Sunday morning .
"If |0 you | need |1 someone | to help |1 you | out with your heating problems , |0 I | DEFINITELY would call TIGER |1 HEATING | and AIR ."
Absolutely a wonderful company .
My |0 family | and I thank |1 you | !!!!!!!!!!
|0 They | Suck
Go somewhere else ...
Wanted to buy a Rhino |1 700 | and a Grizzly 700 .
"After searching high and low for a salesman , I was treated like dirt , and |0 we | left ."
"Parts |0 department | blows , Service |0 department | is even worse ."
"|0 I | live 10 minutes from Cycle City , but |0 I | Drove 50 mile south to Peachstate Powersports in LaGrange , dealt with the owner , Levi , and was well taken |1 care | of ."
Professional and inspiring
"|0 Nigel | from Nidd Design has always provided a first class |1 service | , from his advice and professionalism to the quality of his design drawings and planning applications ."
"His |0 knowledge | and expertise help smooth the |1 way | with any planning application , ensuring |1 compliance | with the building regulations ."
Once |0 you | have met |1 Nigel | |0 you | will not want to work with anyone else .
|0 He | really does turn your |1 dreams | into reality for your home !
|0 We | came at around 730 and |0 they | close at 8 and wanted to try the |1 specials | but |0 they | were out for the day so |0 I | would say go way before |0 they | close .
"Got the crab |1 rangoon | |0 which | was great , tofu with cabbage |0 which | was spicy but good and shrimp satay |0 which | was also good ."
Def going to come back and try this |1 place | again .
|0 Bea | was really nice and asked how the |0 food | was .
Cute place also
As a native southern Californian |0 I | can tell |1 you | that |0 this | is not authentic Mexican food .
"However , |0 I | still like this |1 place | a lot ."
"Esp. the mole , tortilla soup , and guacamole ."
|0 Margaritas | are alright .
My only |0 complaint | is the QUESO .
"|0 It | used to be fabulous , why did you |0 guys | change |1 it | ??"
|0 Queso | should not be watery :( .....
*** update *** NEVER MIND !
|0 They | fixed the |1 queso | !
Thank |1 you | thank |1 you |
There are so many wonderful great |0 places | to dine in houston .... do n't . waste your |1 time | here .
|0 I | had the morelias |1 enchiladas | .
The |0 sauce | was dry and the |0 enchiladas | did not taste good . at all .
In fact my |0 friend | vomited after our meal .
Maybe |0 we | ordered the wrong |1 dish | but my |0 experience | here was poor .
"|0 Service | was okay not great , |0 we | came for a late lunch ."
|0 I | do n't recommend this |1 place | .
Skylight repair
My |0 skylight | was making a horrible |1 noise | when the |0 wind | blew .
|0 James | Bateman came the day |0 I | called and fixed the |1 problem | quickly and efficiently .
|0 He | also inspected my entie |1 roof | to see if there was |0 anything | else |0 that | needed |1 attention | .
|0 He | called the next day to see if |0 everything | was to my satisfaction .
"When the next |0 hailstorm | blows through , |0 I | will not hesitate to contact |1 James | at Team Texas Construction ."
tricky short guy
The new |0 management | is tricky and talk |1 you | into getting video rental |1 agreement | .
To my surprise $ 20 deposit .... New |0 movies | not on shelf .. under the counter for Telugu Speaking people only ... or people |0 who | spend |1 $ | 30 or more groceries ..
|0 That | did |1 it | for me .. no more Raina 's .
Besides |0 parking | is a pain .. cramped and un-ruly with |0 Kumon | Parents next door .... gives |2 me | heebee gee |1 bees' |
Small Firm with Great Service
"|0 Bloom | Legal was really attentive to my problem , and |0 Seth | Bloom took the |1 time | to help |1 me | understand the legal |1 issue | |0 I | was dealing with ."
|0 I | much preferred the one - on - one |1 service | here to the experiences |0 I | 've had with bigger offices and firms .
"While |0 I | hope |0 I | do n't have any |1 need | for a lawyer anytime soon , if |0 I | do |0 I | 'll definitely use this |1 firm | again ."
"Used their |1 service | for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism ( received a phone |1 call | soon after order was placed to confirm |1 details | ) and the subsequent |0 delivery | of my gift ( To Split , Croatia ) was as requested ."
The |0 gift | itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard .
Would highly recommend to anyone requiring overseas gift |1 delivery | .

|0 I | LOVE MY |1 GYM | !
FITNESS |0 UNLIMITED | is a second home to a lot of us gym members |0 who | work out daily .
If |0 you | are serious about working out in a non-commercial like atmosphere then |0 you | have chosen the best |1 place | to be .
|0 This | is the most humble gym |0 you | will every step into .... if |0 you | dare to work on your body do n't be surprised when |0 you | see how addicting going to FITNESS UNLIMITED can be !!
Over-rated ...
This |0 restaurant | is over-rated .
"It is hard to find ... and the mexican |0 food | is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can ."
The |0 service | is poor ...
|0 I | asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get |1 it | .!
"Secondly , the |0 enchladas | did not come with enchilada sauce .. but chili ... like Hormel 's chili .. the |0 cheese | was American cheese !"
The Chili |0 Relleno | .. had no |1 batter | on it .
|0 I | googled |1 restaurants | in the area and Fuji |0 Sushi | came up and |0 reviews | were great so |0 I | made a carry out |1 order | of : L 17 .
Mixed Tempura ..................... 8.25 Shrimp or vegetable tempura & salad .
"|0 I | was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size , to go box set up and quality of the food for the price ."
|0 I | 'm very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again .

Good Pizza at a good price
"|0 I | just moved nearby and have tried |1 several | of the local places , |0 this | was the first one and |0 I | should have just stuck with it ."
"The |0 pizza | is usually pretty good , the only bad |0 one | |0 we | got was on a Friday night and |0 it | just needed to be cooked a little more , but |0 it | was still good ."
Their BBQ chicken |0 pizza | is one of the better ones |0 I | have ever had .
HORRIBLE SERVICE !!!
Absolute horrible service from the parts department .
|0 They | are very rude over the phone and in person .
"|0 They | talk down to you like |0 they | are supreme beings , if |0 you | hate your |1 job | so much then quit !!"
How these |0 guys | can get away with being so rude with people is mind blowing .
|0 I | will NEVER do |1 business | with Sun Toyota again .
Thank |1 god | there are |0 plenty | of Toyota dealerships to choose from in this city .
|0 this | is a good place
|0 I | have been here before and the |0 service | was absoulutely great .
|0 They | had a great |1 selection | of colors to choose from and their |0 seats | are super comfty .
"|0 I | enjoy going there although |0 i | 've only been there once , |0 i | will be returning toda to recieve a |1 pair | of french tips and |0 i | will only go to the best and to me the |0 best | is here ."
|0 i | reccomend |1 you | to go and enjoy their wonderful |1 hospitality | .
"|0 Anna | Marie and Govind are very sweet people , and the minute |0 you | steep into their school , the calm loving |0 atmosphere | takes over , and |0 tension | and worries stay outside in the street , whether or not |0 you | pick |1 them | up again after class is probably a question of practice ."
"A wonderful place , if |0 you | want |1 more | than just the physical side of yoga ."
"Give |2 yourself | the |1 gift | of trying this |1 place | , to see if |0 it | fits |1 you | ..."
|0 They | do n't seem to be interested in selling |1 cars | .
"Went there yesterday : |0 we | are trying to decide between two different Honda models , so |0 we | wanted to test - drive |1 both | back to back ."
The |0 salesperson | refused !
Claimed |0 he | was too busy for two test drives .
|0 We | were the only customers there !
"Do n't waste |1 time | , just drive 10 minutes more down to Stevens Creek , |0 they | actually do try to help their |1 customers | there !"
ATE HERE A COUPLE TIMES .
"|0 IT | IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE , MORE OF THE CUISINE |0 BRETT | ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI ."
"SO , IF |0 YOU | WANT A |1 BURGER | AND FRIES , WELL , |0 IT | IS OK ."
IF |0 YOU | WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH |1 FOOD | - |0 IT | IS GOOD .
"IF |0 YOU | WANT A |1 STEAK | , WELL , |0 THIS | IS NOT THE BEST IN GREEN BAY ."
"OVERALL DECENT BUT IF |0 YOU | ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE |1 STEAK | , |0 THIS | IS NOT IT ."
Eulogic
Good place to be on a Sunday Night .
"The |0 beers | were good , nice choice of beers as well , and as usual the |0 mussels | were great , the |0 place | upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs ."
Filled up on too much beer and hence can not comment on the food .
But the |0 menu | had standard |1 stuff | |1 that | |0 one | would get at a Belgian Tavern .
"If |0 you | are a handcraft beer person , |0 this | is a fantastic place to be ."
Perfect Location plus
|0 I | moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it 's been a refreshing change .
|0 I | used to live at Meadowrun and |0 that | was a nightmare .
The |0 manager | - Tiffany - is actually very nice so |0 I | 'm a bit surprised by other comments .
|0 She | 's very reachable and |0 she | has always responded quickly to any questions or requests .
Plus |0 she | plans a monthly |1 breakfasts | and other events at the clubhouse |0 which | is a nice added benefit .
great service / deals - support this local |1 business |
"|0 I | have used these |1 guys | for new snows , fixing |1 lots | of flats , used replacement tires , and oil changes ."
|0 They | have the best |1 prices | locally and good customer service .
"One |0 guy | is a little surley , but |0 who | gives a |1 crap | as long as your car 's |0 work | is outstanding ."
"AND |0 they | 're usually able to help |1 you | as a walk - in , and |0 they | 're fast ."
Overall - good stuff .
Another great |0 business | bites the |1 dust | !
The best cakes EVER !
"A bit pricey , so |0 I | did n't go very often , but |0 it | was always a treat when |0 I | did ."
The |0 prices | were worth |1 what | |0 I | got .
|0 I | 'm assuming |0 they | are completely out of business since |0 I | ca n't find any contact |1 information | .
"|0 I | 'm hoping the |0 bakers | continue to do their |1 baking | out of another place , because |0 it | would be a shame not to have these |1 cakes | any longer ."
"Super nice people , really good food"
"|0 What | |0 I | love most about this place , other than the food , is that eating here makes |0 you | feel like |0 you | 're in a small town rather than Baltimore ."
"The |0 owners | are really nice , |0 they | serve good |1 food | at a good price , and the |0 option | to eat outside on the deck ( esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any |0 traffic | ) is great ."
One of my top 5 places to eat in Baltimore .
Overpriced
"This |0 place | is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so |0 I | imagine they are owned / operated by the same people ."
"The |0 food | is mediocre at best , and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality ."
Do n't even get |1 me | started on how expensive it is to drink there .
"|0 I | have ate here 3 times since |0 they | first opened , and the |0 service | has been poor each time , the |0 staff | always comes across as somewhat rude and slow ."
Apps 4 Salad 3 Entree 3.5 Wine 5 ( NOV 07 )
Enjoyed this cozy little |1 spot | with a group of 8 folks .
|0 Service | was excellent .
|0 Food | was excellent .
|0 Wine | was excellent .
"|0 I | was feeling the |1 need | for some fish so |0 I | had the |1 salmon | |0 which | was very good but the |0 steaks | looked amazing and if |0 I | am in town again , |0 I | 'll definitely order a |1 steak | ."
A perfect place for a romantic dinner .
"Lots of "" pretty people "" dining inside ."
Great staff .
Very helpful !!!!
"|0 They | interviewed |1 me | , gave |2 me | |1 tests | in the software |0 I | included on my resume , and placed |1 me | in a position |1 that | |0 I | kept for several years ."
Re-interviewed and am going on interviews for a new job .
|0 I | 'm really thankful for the folks at HR Office .
"|0 They | are dependable , have great |1 connections | in the community , and are a great resource for finding a |1 job | ."
|0 I | highly recommend |1 them | to all of my friends !!!! !
Great experience - consider checking out their |1 puppies | before buying from a breeder !
|0 I | adopted a 3.5 month old yellow |1 lab | last winter from the Dumb Friends League .
The |0 staff | was very helpful in finding the right |1 dog | for me and the |0 care | my |0 pup | received was outstanding .
If |0 you | are on the lookout for a pure breed pup do n't forget to check out the |1 shelters | !
My |0 pup | has a wonderful |1 temperment | and has been a wonderful addition to my family !
"|0 Food | good , |0 service | poor"
"No silverware , asked for a spoon for my son s mac and cheese ended up having to use my tea |1 spoon | ."
Asked for bar - b - que sauce never got |1 it | .
Never checked back with us once |0 we | got our |1 food | .
Had to go the the bus boy s station ourselves to get |1 napkins | .
"Only one server , too buys talking with others |0 I | guess ."
"|0 Food | was good , but |0 service | means a |1 lot | to me ."
Dr. Chao |0 you | are the best dentist |0 I | have ever had .
"|0 You | are knowledgeable , professional , gentel and kind ."
"|0 I | wish |0 I | had |1 you | as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my |0 teeth | would have been a lot better then |0 they | are now , However |0 I | am glad |0 you | are my dentist now ."
Even though |0 you | are expensive .
Thank |1 you | for helping to preserve my |1 teeth | .
|0 You | are meticulous in your work and |0 it | shows in my smile .
Con Garage
|0 I | brought my |1 car | in for a simple emissions test .
"|0 I | guess |0 they | figured |1 me | for an easy mark , and tried to explain that my |0 car | would n't pass unless |0 I | replaced a |1 hose | ."
"Ten minutes later , |0 I | took my |1 car | down the street and |0 it | passed the emissions |1 test | with flying colors ."
"If |0 you | 're a fan of herpes , being ripped off , and child molesters , |0 this | is the garage for you ."
"If not , go somewhere else ."
Rude service
even though |0 I | have never tried hoa |1 salon | but |0 I | agree with other reviewers that |0 they | are rude .
"|0 I | called and asked about the price for hair updo and the |0 receptionist | or owner |0 who | aswered the |1 phone | refused to tell |1 me | , or even just give |2 me | an approximate price |1 range | ."
|0 He | told |1 us | to stop by the salon and then |0 he | will tell |2 us | the |1 price | .
What kind of rude service is |0 that | ?
|0 I | do n't want to waste my |1 time | with them .
Top notch eats !
So here |0 we | are in Manson .
Manson ?
"Yes , Manson ."
Right near Chelan .
Aka Nowheresville .
And this litttle |0 gem | of a 7 - table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise .
A short but wide - ranging menu executed with innovative perfection in a cozy hole in the wall just off the main street .
"Fantastic food served without pretense , very reasonably priced wine selections ."
A great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting .
Excellent Service and Reasonable Prices
Boutique stores dealing in children 's clothing / gifts are often outrageously priced ( |0 who | wants to pay 40 |1 dollars | for a newborn onesie ? )
"but |0 I | was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose 's |0 prices | are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the |0 prices | were 20 - 25 % cheaper ) ."
"The |0 service | was also excellent - friendly , helpful and informative without being overbearing ."
Will definitely return .
Consistantly poor
"A |0 lack | of organisation , coupled with the distain for its customers , makes |1 this | the worst rental agency |0 I | have used ."
"Chasing |1 them | on issues from the day |0 I | moved in ( many of them still unresolved as |0 I | left ) to all sorts of farcical issues with funds , after |0 I | left . . . . as soon as |0 I | could ."
"If |0 you | must use |1 them | , be vigilant and be ready to push , if |0 you | can go elsewhere then |0 I | would ."
AMAZING NIGHT - Great Party Spot !!
Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks ... |0 place | is awesome .
"Had to keep in mind that the A / |0 C | broke , |0 I | feel bad |0 it | was their opening !"
"Anyway , once that is fixed , this |0 place | will be amazing ."
"|0 Drinks | were awesome , |0 prices | reasonable , and |0 staff | friendly ."
|0 This | is an awesome date spot |1 that | the |0 area | SERIOUSLY needs .
"Check out The Willow |1 Lounge | , |0 you | ll be happy !"
It s been a few years since |0 I | have been to Ipanema .
"But my |0 wife | and I first went there thinking |0 it | would be Brazilian food ( think |1 lots | of meat ) , but |0 it | turned out to be a vegan restaurant !"
"And , |0 I | can say , |0 this | was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond ."
Amazing !
"Do n't let the nondescript building |1 entrance | fool |1 you | , |0 these | are some creative and talented chefs ... two thumbs way , way up !"
"Excellent food , fantastic wait staff"
|0 I | recently threw a surprise birthday |1 party | for my wife at Fraiser 's .
"|0 We | had 30 |1 guests | for the event , and |0 everyone | came away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well ."
"The |0 management | was easy to deal with during the planning stages , and the |0 execution | by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless ."
"|0 I | highly recommend |1 Fraiser | 's for anyone planning a special |1 event | for friends , family or business ."
FANTASTIC STORE !!!
|0 I | came upon this store as the |0 building | caught my |1 eye | .
"It 's located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building , by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway ."
The store was decorated with furnishings & accessories .
The friendly |0 crew | working was great & very helpful .
This |0 store | is what |0 Colorado | is all about .
"Also , |0 I | purchased some |1 furniture | last year and |0 all | has been great !"
It's |0 durability | & look was perfect and |0 I | will definitely be adding to my collection soon !
"Lovely People , Great Hats"
I was saddened to see the |1 reviews | |0 that | claimed World Hats |0 Mart | has poor |1 service | .
|0 It | led |2 me | to believe that the |0 reviewers | simply had |1 difficulty | tolerating |1 people | with strongly - accented English .
The |0 husband | and wife |0 who | run this |1 spot | are lovely people .
|0 We | have had many |1 conversations | with them and |0 they | have always been extremely patient with me as |0 I | tried on multiple |1 hats | in search of the right costumes for my magic act .
|0 I | recommend |1 them | highly !
"DO NT ever go there , not even if your |0 car | flips ."
"Their |0 service | sucks to start off with , |0 people | are cruel and ignorant ."
|0 I | 'm compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products .
"|0 They | DO NOT have a return |1 policy | and even if their |0 product | SUCKS , |0 they | will NOT take |1 it | back !"
DO NOT EVER GO HERE .
|0 I | prefer Advanced auto |1 parts | over this crappy place with the meanest people .
And |0 they | THRIVE to get a |1 customer | .
DO NOT go here .. thank |1 you |
Horrible
|0 I | have been growing my |1 hair | out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 |1 inch | taken off .
"|0 I | walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1.5 in the back ."
My |0 hair | is uneven and |0 it | looks rediculous .
This |0 woman | should be working in supercuts ... if that .
|0 This | was a terrible experience and |0 I | hope that no |0 one | else goes through that .
Do your |2 self | a |1 favor | and do not go to this establishment .
The worst Burger King restaurant !!!
"|0 I | generally like the |1 BK | over the other fast serving restaurants ; however , |0 I | regreted to visit this |1 restaurant | at my town ."
"|0 This | is a shame of my adorable town , Branford ."
|0 I | ordered a kid |1 meal | with a milk and found a bottle was half opened already .
|0 I | asked |1 them | to change |1 it | but |0 they | rudely said that |0 it | was okay .
Disgusting french |0 fries | is very best menu .
"Do n't go , or |0 you | will learn how to waste your |1 money | ."
Disappointed
The Bad : |0 I | was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food .
|0 We | were a party of 4 and |0 none | of us were particularly pleased with our dishes .
|0 Napa | is all about wine but gives very short |1 descriptions | of the wines on their lists .
|0 I | found my initial |1 selection | satisfactory but the wine flight |0 we | chose to be poorly composed .
If |0 you | must go ask |1 lots | of questions about your selections since your |0 expectations | may as high as |0 mine | were .
Highly Recommended
|0 We | walked in to pick our little |1 man | at 10 minutes to closing and heard |1 laughter | from kids and the staff .
The |0 facilities | are more than adequate and the |0 staff | are just phenomenal .
Their |0 sense | of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes |1 me | every time |0 I | walk in .
"|0 We | have since moved slightly further away from the centre but |0 it | 's worth the extra |1 travel | , as the |0 care | provided exceeds our |1 expectations | ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere ."
HORRIBLE !!!! !
|0 This | has to be some of the worst pizza |0 I | have ever had the |1 misfortune | of ordering .
"The |0 crust | was lopsided , thicker on one side than the other ."
|0 It | actually had a |1 hole | in one of the slices .
There was minimal |0 cheese | and sauce and |0 it | completely lacked |1 flavor | .
|0 I | know New York |1 pizza | and |0 this | is not it !!
|0 This | was nothing like New York style pizza !!!.
|0 I | love |1 pizza | and |0 this | was a complete and utter disappointment !!
|0 I | would not suggest this |1 pizza | to anyone !!!
best quote ever My |0 gate | was stuck halfway open so |0 I | called A CLASS Garage Doors Dr |1 Services | .
|0 They | came to my house in no time and started working on the gate .
|0 They | were very friendly and were able to explain |2 me | exactly |0 what | was |1 wrong | with it .
Once |0 they | fixed |1 it | |0 they | answetred |1 all | of my questions with no hesitations and then gave |2 me | the best |1 quote | ever .
"|0 I | know that if my garage |0 door | needs to be repaired , |0 I | will be calling A CLASS Garage |1 Doors |"
|0 You | will be happy at this store !
Allen Tire was recommended by friend after |0 my | having bad tire |1 experiences | in Temecula .
"The store |0 manager | , Jim Smith , made an excellent tire |1 recommendation | for my newly acquired Lexus ."
|0 Tires | were the right price and now the |0 car | feels like |0 it | is riding on rails around turns .
"The store is clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in ."
|0 They | know their |1 job | and |0 you | do not have to watch |1 them | to be sure everything is done right .
Easiest Time |0 I | ever had purchasing a |1 car | !
"Excellent service , Not only did |0 they | get the exact |1 car | |0 I | wanted win in 48 hours but the sales |0 man | also took |1 me | out to lunch ."
Very kind and reliable .
|0 I | highly recommend this |1 dealership | if |0 you | would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly |1 service | .
"|0 I | have since purchased two |1 cars | from this dealership , The first |0 one | was from Phillip and the |0 second | was from Richard ."
|0 Both | were excellent sales men |0 who | put my |1 needs | first .
This |0 place | has done a great |1 job | of taking |1 care | of the usual maintenance on my hooptie .
"|0 I | also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker ... and never get the usual |1 excuses | other |0 shops | always gave |1 me | ... "" the inspection |0 guy | is n't here today "" .... for example ."
Today |0 I | went into Kwik Kar and there were two |0 cars | in front of me for inspection ... but |0 I | was still out of there pretty quick ... barely had |1 time | to read a |1 chapter | in my book .
Extremely helpful and professional
"As first - time home buyers , my |0 husband | and I found |1 Stephanie | Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty , extremely helpful ."
"|0 She | worked with us for over a year , helping |1 us | find our perfect |1 home | ."
"Stephanie 's |0 knowledge | of the market and properties in our price range , made |1 us | feel secure in our decision to buy when |0 we | did ."
|0 We | would highly recommend |1 Stephanie | to anyone looking for a home in the Yampa Valley .
"|0 We | appreciated her |1 patience | , knowledge and kindness !"
Great Barber
"Firstly , the other |0 reviewer | clearly has never been to Nick 's , or |0 he | would know that |0 Nick | only charges |1 $ | 13 for a haircut |0 which | is pretty much industry standard ."
|0 I | have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because |0 he | does pay |1 attention | to detail .
|0 I | have terrible |1 hair | and |0 he | really takes his |1 time | to make |1 it | look right .
"|0 Some | of the younger kids |0 that | work there are a bit sub par , but if |0 you | wait for Nick ... |0 you | 'll be good ."
UGH !!!
"Got some nice "" freshly baked "" fruit |1 squares | , a personal favorite of mine ."
"Took a |1 bite | , |0 it | tasted odd ."
Flipped the |1 square | over and saw |1 it | riddled with green mold !!!!
Ugh !!
"|0 I | called the |1 store | and the |0 clerk | giggled , and agreed that |0 it | was gross , but said |0 it | was not her problem ."
|0 She | also refused to get a |1 manager | .
"|0 I | left my |1 number | , or tried to anyway ."
Same |0 clerk | had considerable |1 difficulty | taking down a |1 number | .
|0 I | 'll never go back there again
"For cheap Chinese food , |0 this | is the place to go ."
"|0 I | used to eat at places like New China or Green Buffet in Troy , MO - nothing terrible but not that great ."
"Now , |0 I | wo n't eat fast |1 food | Chinese unless |0 it | 's from this place ."
The best value |0 I | 've found from a Chinese restaurant .
"|0 I | do n't live in Lake St. Louis anymore , but |0 deliveries | were always correct and the |0 service | courteous ."
Now |0 I | have to be in the area to get some |1 lovin' | : sad face :
Amazing Experience !
My |0 experience | was amazing at Providence Aesthetics and Medical Spa .
|0 Jana | Kueck was nothing but professional .
|0 She | makes |1 you | feel like |0 you | are the most important person in the world .
|0 Jana | made |1 me | feel very comfortable .
Provided |1 me | with warm blanket and has soft |1 music | playing .
Walking in the door you are made to feel happy and relaxed .
|0 Equipment | is state of the art .
|0 I | would reccomend |2 anyone | to go see |1 Jana | Kueck and Robin Talley to see all the many |1 procedures | |0 they | have to offer .
"|0 Dave | is a patient and methodical teacher , |0 who | has a great |1 ear | and sensitivity for his students ' passion and the direction |0 they | want their |1 lessons | to take ."
"Also , |0 he | loves |1 teaching | so much , his |0 price | is unbeatable , but |0 that | does not change his |1 level | of skill ."
|0 Dave | has |1 much | to offer .
"In just 2 - 3 focused lessons , |0 I | 'm already now capable of picking up new |1 songs | off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own |1 orginals | with confidence !"

|0 We | love our new |1 roof | !
|0 We | would like to thank |1 you | for the roofing job |0 you | did on our home .
Everything was done on a timely manner and things were cleaned and picked up every day when the |0 crew | was done .
|0 We | also liked the |1 way | that |0 Ray | checked on the job every day .
And when the |0 job | was done every thing was cleaned up and hauled off that same day .
|0 We | would not hesitate to use Spears |1 Roofing | again .
|0 We | have already recommended |1 you | to some of our friends !
OMFG
"|0 I | FUCKING HATE THIS |1 PLACE | EVERY TIME |0 i | GO THIS HOT |0 CHICK | SHOWS UP AND |0 i | MEAN REALLY HOT BUT |0 SHE | IS LIKE REAAAALLY DUMB AND THEN THEIR IS THIS OTHER |0 CHICK | |0 THAT | IS REALY UGLY BUT |0 SHE | IS LIKE SUPER SMART |0 SHE | COULD BE A SCIENTIST , BUT THEN THEIR IS THIS |0 STONER | |0 WHO | ALWAYS COMES HERE HIGH AND |0 HE | ALWAYS BRINGS HIS FUCKING |1 DOG | |0 WHO | IS SO HIGH FROM THE SECOND HAND SMOKE |0 I | THINK |0 HE | IS TRYING TO TALK ."
ANYWAY |0 WE | DRIVE AROUND IN MY VAN AND SOLVE |1 MYSTERYS | AND SHIT
AMAZINGLY YUMMY !
|0 I | just got back from france yesterday and just missed the |1 food | already !
"My |0 sister | in law told |1 me | about this amazing new crepe place in town , |0 I | was so excited |0 I | just wanted to go and test |1 it | out for my self !"
Their customer |0 service | was perfect !
Their |0 Food | was better then anything |0 I | had ever tasted .
EVEN IN FRANCE !
"|0 I | would highly recommend this |1 place | to anyone looking for a great atmosphere , amazing food , and great customer service !"
Thank |2 you | Roll UP |1 Crepes | !
"|0 This | is one of the worst places |0 I | have stayed , |0 we | cut out |1 stay | short and went to the Mulberry ."
"Even though |0 they | still charge |2 you | the |1 days | |0 you | booked but wo n't use , it is worth |1 the | get the hell out of this crap hole ."
The whole |0 experience | shows a |1 hotel | managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager .
Bad service starting from the front desk .
The best |0 person | is the valet .
"Short of that , avoid this |1 place | , as a silver Marriott member , |0 this | is a disgrace ."
BEST PLACE IN AMES
"|0 I | lived here for two years when the |0 prices | were a little lower :) The |0 places | are very nice and clean , and in great condition !"
"|0 I | really enjoyed the |1 staff | at Wessex , also the |0 manager | Sherri was always very nice and helpful ."
The fitness |0 center | was GREAT !
"The only |0 problem | |1 that | |0 I | had in 2 years of living there was that the |0 walls | are pretty thin , sometimes |0 I | could here my neighbors |1 conversations | ."
|0 I | would recommend these |1 apartments | to anybody !
|0 I | absolutely LOVED living there .
The Best Service Ever !!
|0 I | have never had better |1 service | .
My |0 car | broke down and |0 roadside | towed my |1 vehicle | to Sussman Kia .
|0 They | squeezed |1 me | in and had |1 me | back up and running in no time .
|0 Everyone | was pleasant and very helpful .
The service |0 department | even gave |2 me | a |1 ride | home and picked |1 me | up when my |0 car | was finished .
The |0 advisor | kept |1 me | up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle .
|0 I | give this |2 dealer | an |1 A | + !
|0 I | will definitely be bringing my |1 car | back for service .
HEAVEN ON EARTHHHHHHH !!!!
MUST TRY !!!

[ no homo ] :D
"friendly , fine food"
The one - star |0 review | from 2005 is out of date .
There was a |0 change | of ownership a couple of years ago and |0 service | is both quick and extremely friendly .
"The |0 food | continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches , homemade soups , fresh salads ."
The |0 atmosphere | may not be for everyone .
"|0 It | is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ) , but if |0 you | are OK with that , the |0 food | is very good ."
Love the |1 soups | .
The New Italian Kid on the Block
Another Italian restaurant in Collingswood ?
Do |0 we | need another |1 one | ?
Only if |0 it | is of the quality of That 's Amore .
The |0 menu | has the |1 usual | but then |0 they | step |1 it | up another notch .
The arancini di |0 riso | ( risotto fritters ) are not to be missed .
Chicken |0 saltimboca | was excellent and then there 's the chocolate |0 mousse | |0 that | comes straight from heaven .
Pay extra |1 attention | to the appetizers - the next time |0 I | go there |0 I | 'm planning on ordered a |1 few | instead of an entree .
Auto |0 Towing | is one of the best towing services |0 I | have used .
The first time |0 I | used |1 them | |0 they | arrived on time and towed |1 car | for me to the destination |0 I | needed .
The auto |0 mechanics | |0 that | work for Auto Towing are very friendly and informative and answered any |1 question | |0 I | had .
|0 They | have towed |1 car | for me a few times and |0 I | am always very satisfied with this services .
"If |0 you | are looking for towing services |0 that | can offer |2 you | a good towed car |1 service | , then Auto |0 Towing | is the company for you ."
A very satisfied new customer !
"As a very satisfied new customer , |0 I | wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct |1 Cleaning | ."
"|0 They | are professional , knowledgeable , and take meticulous |1 care | and pride in accomplishing their |1 work | ."
"Not only were my |0 wife | and I very pleased , but |0 I | also had the air duct |1 quality | tested professionally by the home inspector |1 that | |0 I | regularly use , before and after United Air |0 Duct | performed their |1 work | ."
"Based on the test results , the home |0 inspector | stated that the |0 quality | of their job was “ excellent ” ."
The Best Breakfast in Solana Beach !
|0 We | love T 's |1 Cafe | !
Without a doubt the best place to grab a tall bloody |1 mary | and some eggs benedict .
|0 T | 's has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason .
|0 Family | owned and operated makes sure the |0 atmosphere | is relaxed and the |0 food | home - cooked with style .
|0 I | highly recommend picking up a |1 jug | of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
"If |0 you | 've been to North County , |0 chances | are |0 it | 's in your favorites list already ."
Prominent Builders NJ
"Prominent |0 Builders | in New Jersey are one the best building contractors , I was referred to them by my friend , |0 I | am so glad |0 I | used |1 them | for my Home renovation , and addition ."
"|0 They | were very professional , respectful , completed the |1 Job | on time , and well below my budget ."
"|0 Mike | one of owners was awesome , |0 he | explained the detailed |1 plan | , and executed on time , |0 I | am always going use |1 them | and refer |1 them | to many friends |0 I | can because of the great job |0 they | did |1 me | ."
Great Dude Cut !
"Great service , cool vibe , impeccable style ."
|0 I | 'm a guy with tricky hair so getting |1 that | right is job # 1 .
After going through 5 other places |0 I | finally found |1 Janice | at Alta Moda .
Not only was |0 it | a good cut but my |0 wife | and friends comment on my hair every time |0 I | leave ... saying |0 it | 's the best look |0 I | 've ever had .
Either |0 I | suck at my own style or |0 Janice | is a genius .
Looks like there 's a |0 lot | of talent in this place .
Worth every |1 penny | .
My Favorite place at Wildwood
"|0 I | have been going to the Wildwood , NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the |1 Madrid | first ."
|0 I | rated |1 it | 5 stars .
|0 I | am not saying |0 it | is a 5 star hotel .
"|0 I | am saying when comparing all other |1 hotels | in Wildwood , this |0 hotel | has |1 everything | that |0 we | are looking for ."
"It is the |0 hospitality | from Tom and staff , |0 that | makes |1 it | feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach ."
|0 We | prefer the |1 layout | of rooms and |0 it | is always clean .
"When in Scordia , Sicily"
If ever in Sicily please take the |1 time | to visit |1 Anna | Maria Jose Mudo and her familia .
|0 They | are and always will be the nicest people in Sicily |1 that | |0 you | will meet .
|0 You | will also have the |1 pleasure | of learning the Italiano |1 language | .
"|0 You | will also have the |1 experience | of learning the bella Sicilian |1 culture | , |1 that | |0 I | have fallen in luv with ."
|0 I | will 4 - ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv |1 that | my Sicilian |0 family | showed |1 me | when |0 I | was there for 3 years .
Luv always ..
"|0 I | 've never felt the |1 need | to write a |1 review | or make a |1 complaint | before , but after the way I was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels ( whose |1 name | |0 I | believe to be Mrs Closs ) |0 I | would now not recommend this |1 business | to anybody ."
If the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then |0 this | leaves a |1 lot | to be desired !
Nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their |0 day | may have been or what may be going on in their private lives !
Best Car Dealer in TX
|0 I | purchased a |1 nissan | from this dealship .
The sales |0 men | were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car |0 we | looked at .
|0 They | were very patient and helpful from showing the |1 cars | to doing the |1 paperwork | .
The |0 paperwork | was a very easy and smooth .
|0 They | tried to run my credit |1 score | as less as possible so |0 it | wo n't hurt my |1 score | .
"Overall , |0 I | was very happy with the customer service and my purchase ."
"If |0 you | 're looking to buy a |1 car | , definitely give |2 them | a |1 call | ."
|0 They | have a huge |1 inventory | .
|0 I | have been a patient a NW hospital and |0 it | was great .
|0 I | have also had an 80 yr |1 old | that |0 I | take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital .
"Yes , |0 we | had to wait , but |0 ER | is a triage system |0 that | takes the most life threatening |1 cases | first ."
Any |0 ER | would be the same .
"As far as being treated like a drug seeker , |0 that | has not been my experience ."
As a nurse |0 I | know about drug seekers .
|0 This | is a great hospital and even better since |0 it | became part of the UW system .
Wonderful Experience
"|0 I | had immense |1 pain | on a Sunday morning , with |0 friends | and family telling |1 me | that |0 I | would never find a |1 Dentist | on a Sunday ."
"|0 Dr. | Taylor was not only available on a Sunday , but also was able to immediately take |1 care | of me ."
"|0 He | was incredibly informative about the options |0 I | had , giving |2 me | |1 opinions | on different treatments to choose from ."
"Coming from a person |0 who | hates the |1 dentist | in general , |0 Dr. | Taylor was the best !"
|0 He | really made the |1 visit | a pain free one with excellent service !
|0 I | would recommend |1 him | to everyone !
HORRIBLE
This |0 school | is the worst one |0 i | 've ever been to .
"|0 I | attended |1 it | for 2 years , and |0 that | was enough ."
"There 's |0 holes | everywhere in the ceiling , |0 sewage | constantly leaks through the ceiling , and the whole |0 condition | of the school is horrible ."
"The |0 staff | and the Principal are rediculous , |0 they | do n't listen to any input , and |0 they | make up rediculous |1 rules | ( |0 They | banned |1 backpacks | , because a |0 teacher | TRIPPED OVER a student 's ) ."
"The |0 education | is horrible at best , do |2 society | a |1 favor | , and do NOT send your |1 student | here ."
Excellent customer service and quality work .
|0 They | went the extra |1 mile | to repair my cowboy |1 boots | -- |0 they | had to have a special |1 kind | of paper |0 that | looked like wood grain to fix the |1 heels | .
|0 That | was 4 years ago .
|0 I | have n't been able to find a shoe repair |1 place | in Seattle since |0 that | has been able to do |1 it | .
( |0 I | 've been through at least 5 places already . )
"If |0 I | had |1 time | to drive to Tacoma before |0 they | closed during the work week , |0 I | would just so |0 I | could get those |1 boots | fixed properly again ."
So Handy for Local La Jolla Stuff - Especially for Finding Residential |1 Numbers |
"Since moving back from college and trying to settle |1 roots | in the Village , |0 I | have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers ."
The white |0 pages | allowed |1 me | to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that |0 I | could track |1 people | down one by one and the restaurant |0 section | is basically my cookbook .
It 's really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and |0 I | want to spread the |1 word | .
THX :-)
"The |0 staff | do occasionally get game |1 info | correct , but if |0 you | r looking fot a good game and are n't a nerd , do nt ask |1 them | ."
The last time |0 I | did |1 that | I was suggested to buy |1 oblivion | when |0 I | told |1 them | |0 I | was looking for a fps .
|0 I | knew what |0 it | was and told the |1 guy | that |0 it | was n't a fps .
|0 He | tried to tell |1 me | |0 it | was when |0 I | told asked |1 him | if |0 he | knew what |0 fps | stood for and |0 he | had no |1 clue | .
Overall |0 they | are n't very knowledge about the type of games are on the market .
First and Last time |0 we | 'll eat there
My |0 friend | and I went there for lunch today .
Neither |0 one | of us had ever been - so |0 we | thought |0 we | 'd try |1 it | .
BIG MISTAKE - The |0 food | was tasteless and cold .
|0 We | both kept trying to find |1 something | |0 we | liked .
"The only |0 thing | |0 I | found edible were the potato wedges , |0 I | finally gave up , |0 he | kept trying - |0 he | found the fried |1 wantons | to be OK - His Mongolian |0 bowl | was awful ."
Would NOT recommend this |1 place | to anyone - in fact - save your |1 money | and go somewhere else .
|0 Liquidweb.com | Rocks !!!
"|0 I | am not a client of liquidweb.com , but |0 one | of my friend called Steven is the client having several |1 websites | ."
|0 I | work with him and since past 6 years |0 he | is hosting his |1 websites | to Liquidweb .
"As |0 I | have gone through many reviews sites to see if any |0 provider | is providing better |1 services | or not , and |0 I | have realized that there were many good |0 reviews | about Liquidweb also |0 Steven | never faced any server |1 issues | in his whole hosting ."
The |0 kind | of support |0 they | provide is simply great !!!
|0 I | would like to host my upcoming |1 website | to Liquidweb.com

simple but perfect
"IF |0 you | want flashy fancy |1 food | stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes , |0 this | is not the place for you ."
"If |0 you | want perfectly executed simple |1 dishes | |0 that | feature a few exquisite |1 ingredients | , |0 you | 'll love |1 Vetri | ."
Hands - down the best pasta and gnocchi |0 I | 've ever eaten ( and |0 I | 've eaten a |1 lot | ) .
"The |0 antipasti | were amazing , the |0 wines | were mind - blowing , the |0 service | could n't have been better ."
|0 I | 've dined at lots of high - end restaurants and |0 I | 've never before felt my money was so well spent .
"Great Prices , Great service !"
|0 I | 've been to this shop twice ( once for an inspection and again for an oil change ) and |0 they | truly live up to their name : Discount !
"|0 They | have all |1 kind | of coupons available for car washes , oil changes , state inspection , etc ."
"The |0 thing | is , |0 you | still get high quality |1 service | at nicely discounted rates !"
There is even free |0 coffee | and bottles of water if |0 you | 'd like .
The |0 owner | is a pleasant guy and |0 I | would trust my |1 car | with him or any of his workers .
"Top notch , all the way !"
|0 David | is amazing
|0 David | is the most helpful and creative photographer |1 that | |0 I | have used .
|0 He | is willing to do |1 whatever | |0 you | need from him without hesitation .
|0 He | was patient and adapted when |0 everything | did n't go according to schedule on my wedding day .
Both the engagement and wedding |0 pictures | |1 that | |0 he | took for us we absolutely amazing .
|0 He | got the |1 pictures | back to me quickly .
|0 I | would highly recommend |1 David | to anyone .
|0 He | will exceed your |1 expectations | !
|0 He | does n't just take |1 pictures | |0 he | makes |1 art | out of them and |0 you | wo n't even notice that there 's a |0 camera | there .
Not so great
My |0 husband | just got a |1 bike | there as a gift he 's only had |1 it | a month .
|0 It | 's a nice bike and |0 it | cost a |1 lot | of money .
But just this week a |0 peddle | broke .
|0 He | took |1 it | back and |0 they | would not honor a |1 warranty | and said |0 it | was his fault because of his shoes ??
So |0 they | were going to charge |1 him | for new peddles and proceeded to put |1 them | on without even telling |2 him | the |1 price | .
|0 Which | was very expensive .
|0 He | asked for a different pair instead and |0 they | only gave |2 him | five |1 dollars | off ??
|0 Trek | is not so great
Only Concerned With Money
|0 I | have been getting my |1 treatments | for a few months now and have seen some |1 results | but not up to the standards |1 that | I was told |0 I | should expect .
"The |0 people | there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but |0 I | was disappointed with their customer service ."
"Never miss an |1 appointment | because |0 they | will charge |2 you | the |1 price | of a treatment , even if |0 you | had an |1 emergency | ."
|0 It | 's pretty ridiculous !
|0 They | want to squeeze as much as |0 they | can from you even if |0 you | just got in a car accident !!!!
|0 They | do n't care one bit about you !!!!!
Terrible service !!!
Made an |1 appointment | to have |1 them | come to the house to discuss curtain |1 options | and give an |1 estimate | .
|0 They | sent over |1 someone | |0 who | said |0 he | knows |1 nothing | about curtains and could not show |2 me | fabric |1 options | or give an |1 estimate | .
"When |0 I | called the |1 manager | to complain , |0 she | said |0 she | KNEW the |0 guy | did n't know about curtains and that the usual |0 lady | called in sick hours earlier !"
Instead of rescheduling |0 they | chose to waste my |1 time | instead .
So what was the |0 point | of the appointment !?!
To just come over and hang out ?!?
|0 I | will NEVER do |1 business | with this company !
EVER !!!
Internet |0 Department | is rude and insulting
"|0 I | was looking to bring a |1 customer | to their lot to buy a |1 car | but the Internet |0 salesperson | Last |0 name | is Balazick sent |2 me | this |1 email | "" AND IF |0 IT | WAS WORTH MY |1 TIME | |0 I | WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR |1 QUESTIONS | ."
"|0 I | MAKE |1 MONEY | NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS "" Wow , can |0 you | believe in today s tough times this |0 dealership | would be looking for any way to move |1 vehicles | ."
As a previous Internet Manager |0 I | would deal with anyone looking to buy a |1 car | for a profit and not care if |0 they | came in with a broker .
Stay away from this dealership !!!
This |0 place | is a Rip - Off
"|0 I | brought a |1 car | in to have the "" check |1 engine | "" |1 light | diagnosed back in March of 2010 ."
"|0 They | said |0 it | was "" plugs and wires "" and quoted |2 me | |1 $ | 330 to do the |1 work | , including parts ."
|0 I | asked why so high and |0 they | said |0 it | was due to the labor of moving |1 things | out of the way .
Those |0 things | ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank ( 1 screw ) and the air filter canister ( 4 spring clips ) .
|0 I | did the |1 work | myself for $ 50 .
There 's no |0 excuse | for that kind of estimate .
My |0 girlfriend | and I took a |1 chance | on this place because |0 we | did n't want to wait in line at Outback .
What an amazing find - this |0 restaurant | is a GEM .
# 1 |0 it | s immaculately clean .
"# 2 the |0 decor | is tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the |0 food | is FANTASTIC ."
|0 This | is authentic Cuban cuisine ; fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly .
The |0 portions | were generous and |0 we | got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
TRY THIS |1 PLACE | - |0 YOU | 'LL LOVE |1 IT | .
Thank |1 you | for helping |1 me | get more healthy !
|0 I | came in and saw |1 Dr. | Ruona about a month ago for quitting |1 smoking | .
|0 I | have to tell |1 you | that |0 I | have n't had |1 one | and do n't want |1 one | .
|0 It | is the easiest thing |1 that | |0 I | have ever done and |0 I | tell all my |1 friends | that |0 they | should do |1 it | too .
|0 I | sent a |1 customer | of mine to you .
"Dr. Ruona , if |0 you | read |1 this | , thank |1 you | for helping |1 me | get more healthy ."
|0 I | feel lighter and feel that |0 I | have more |1 possibilities | open to me now than |0 I | did before .
|0 I | ca n't thank |1 you | enough .

Fantastic for kids
If |0 you | have |1 children | or are just a real animal lover yourself |0 you | 'll love this |1 zoo | .
|0 It | 's only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
|0 They | sell |1 feed | and milk bottles at the front and |0 I | recommend |0 you | buy |1 lots | .
|0 We | took our 7 |1 month | old and |0 she | laughed and giggled when ( very harshly |0 I | might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the |1 goats | and lambs .
The |0 animals | were all very sweet and patient with her .
"Among the animals |0 that | were available to touch were |0 pony's | , camels and EVEN AN OSTRICH !!!"
"Wonderful , inexpensive and lots of fun !"
WOW !!!
|0 I | ca n't say enough good |1 things | about Karla and the wonderful things |0 she | has done for me and my dog Gracee .
|0 Gracee | is more excited to see |1 her | than |0 she | is excited to see |1 me | !!!!
|0 She | has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls !
|0 She | has taken |1 care | of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and |0 I | would not let |1 Gracee | go with anyone besides her !!!
"|0 She | is caring , punctual , and very enthusiastic about her job !"
|0 You | should give |2 her | a |1 try | - |0 it | 's worth every |1 penny | to know that you |0 pet | is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting !!!!
Worst Service |0 I | 've Ever Experienced
"|0 I | wish there was |0 something | good to say about the business , but unfortunately , there is n't ."
1 ) |0 Service | and manners were nonexistent .
2 ) The |0 employees | constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative .
( to both myself and customers ) 3 ) |0 I | have never experienced so much |1 rudeness | coming from a business .
4 ) The |0 business | is very unorganized .
"The |0 invoice | is not detailed , so it is difficult to see |1 what | |0 you | are paying for ."
|0 I | 'd recommend to save your |1 time | and energy and find another greek |1 store | .
|0 Exile | is the best !!!
|0 Exile | is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in Richmond !
|0 I | have been shopping there for over six years now .
"The |0 staff | is incredibly friendly and helpful and the |0 owner | , Mimmy , is an absolute angel ."
The mark |0 up | is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe .
"In addition , the |0 clothing | is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic , which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia ."
|0 Exile | is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community .
Shop local at Exile !!
Over-rated
"|0 Buddakan | inevitably attracts the |1 majority | of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr , but |0 that | does n't impress |1 me | ."
"The |0 atmosphere | alone deserves 4 |1 stars | but , the |0 food | was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the |0 restaurant | carries ."
"The |0 server | |0 we | had was knowledgeable but |0 he | was not as proper as |0 he | should have been , acting like |0 he | was talking to his friends rather than his customers ."
The angry |0 lobster | was completely over-priced !
$ 80 for a dish |0 that | has about one small lobster |1 tail | and is full of filler vegetables !
|0 I | would n't go there again .
|0 Alto | delivers on all levels .
"From the moment |0 you | enter the |1 restaurant | , |0 you | know |0 you | are some place special ."
"The |0 service | is impeccable , and the |0 food | is even better ."
"|0 I | highly recommend the four - course tasting |1 menu | , |0 which | gives |2 you | |1 plenty | of range and food to satisfy your |1 appetite | ."
"Also , if |0 you | are into wine , |0 Alto | has the |1 depth | of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any |1 sommelier | ( or after 9 pm , bring your own |1 bottle | for free ... no corking fee ! ) ."
"While |0 it | 's not cheap , |0 Alto | will give |2 you | an |1 experience | |0 you | 'll never forget ."
The |0 landlord | is not nice nor helpful
|0 I | have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years .
|0 I | love the |1 location | and the apartment !!
|0 I | 'm a single female and |0 I | feel safe coming home at night .
The maintenance |0 people | are AWESOME !!!!
"And the |0 exterminator | is very nice , also ."
"Yes , |0 you | still have a few |1 bugs | , but |0 that | 's going to be anywhere |0 you | go !"
The only |0 problem | |1 that | |0 I | have experienced is the landlord .
|0 She | is a pure b**** !!!
|0 I | know |0 that | 's ugly ... but |0 she | wo n't help |1 you | out for anything ... sad story .
"Other than that , |0 I | would recommend living here . :)"
The |0 staff | leaves a |1 lot | to be desired .
The front |0 staff | has seen quite a |1 bit | of turnover and changed from professional to rude .
A simple follow - up phone |0 call | with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare .
|0 She | may be the reason for all the change .
|0 I | sincerely wonder if the |0 doctor | has a |1 clue | about what is going on within his practice .
If |0 he | does know and approves of this behavior then |0 it | is a poor reflection on him .
Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
|0 He | was an okay doctor but not worth |1 her | .
WWW - Wonderful Wild Wildernest inn
|0 I | would give the Wildernest |2 inn | ten |1 stars | of five !
"Atop Spring Mountain , from the decks of the West porch , "" |0 one | can see forever "" a |1 scene | of unparalleled beauty and grandeur ."
"|0 I | saw |1 deer | frequently , in fact a small |0 herd | were grazing near the lodge ."
There were occasional |0 bears | on the deck in the morning .
"and most correctly , |0 us | visitors did not mingle with the native wildlife ."
|0 It | would have been more than |0 one | could bear !
"|0 Kathy | and Stewart , the proprietors were the epitome of perfection ."
"Delightful , hospitable , superb , cozy and comfortable ."
|0 I | hope to be back !
junkie lube ?!
"really weird place , |0 I | was driving home from work thought |0 I | 'd stop in for an oil change and well , there are a few |0 guys | in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking |1 beers | and shooting the |1 breeze | ."
"The neon lighting |0 sign | still said "" on "" yet some |0 guy | |0 who | seemed to be the oldest of the bunch , more like the drunkest of the bunch told |1 me | |0 they | 'd be open tomorrow ."
|0 I | asked if a |0 manager | was on duty |0 he | told |1 me | |0 he | was .
WOW !
"grey shirt "" mark "" of course with this type behavior |0 he | could have been wearing someon else s |1 clothing | ....."
A |0 friend | and I recently took our |1 16 | and 18 month olds here .
"While there was n't too |0 much | available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ) , |0 we | went right when |0 they | opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there , so we were given a little more |1 liberty | than |0 we | would have if |0 others | had been there ."
"|0 It | 's not the classiest place , but |0 it | was cleaner than |0 I | expected and the |0 staff | was very friendly ."
For $ 4 |0 it | was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
Restored my |1 faith | in Mechaincs .
|0 I | spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my |1 Ferrari | to run and drive the way |0 it | should .
|0 I | was about to give up when |0 I | met |1 Jason | and Neal .
|0 They | took on the |1 challenge | of making my |1 Ferrari | all |0 I | dreamed of and more .
The |0 crew | at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave |2 me | back a |1 car | |0 I | can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning .
|0 I | can not say |1 enough | about this place .
|0 They | have restored my |1 faith | in Mechanics .
"Do |2 yourself | a |1 favor | , call these |1 guys | first and enjoy driving your |1 car | again .."
a great vacation !
|0 We | wanted to see the |1 sun | - and |0 we | also got much |1 more | !
Excellent |0 chefs | are in the kitchen preparing memorable |1 breakfasts | .
"After a train ride over the mountains , |0 we | enjoyed |1 hiking | in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if |0 we | wanted |1 it | on the patio in the evening ...."
"|0 This | is a busy group of hosts |0 they | are also running a |1 restaurant | , |0 which | also must be wonderful - so just ask for |1 what | |0 you | need , and |0 I | 'm sure |0 they | will do their |1 best | to be hospitable ."
OMG
"OMG .. make sure to book a |1 reservation | , as this magical |0 place | is packed ( in a nice way ) |0 I | love that the |0 owner | walks around and cares how his |0 customers | feel about their food ."
The |0 waiters | are like no other ...
"My |0 waiter | was so excellent |0 I | gave |2 him | a 75 % |1 tip | , and |0 it | was worht every |1 penny | .."
The |0 food | was |0 finger | licking the |1 bowel | fantastic ..
|0 I | just discovered |0 her | has a |1 place | right near my work ( Color |1 me | Phat ) If |0 you | are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley |0 Giovanni | Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice .
|0 Holly | is truely the best hairstylist !
"|0 I | have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years , and |0 I | never new this |0 salon | was here until a |0 friend | reffered |1 me | to see |1 Holly | here ."
|0 I | was very pleased with my experience here .
|0 All | of the people were friendly and welcoming .
"|0 I | got |1 highlights | , haircut , and a blowdry ."
|0 She | did a great |1 job | !
"|0 Holly | is very experienced and talented , and |0 I | could tell |0 she | new |1 what | |0 she | was doing right off the bat ."
"My |0 hair | looks amazing , and |0 I | get |1 compliments | all the time ."
|0 I | deffenitly reccomend this |1 salon | and Holly to anyone .
You will not be disappointed !!!!!!
Outdated but not bad
So |0 I | really felt like this |0 place | was extremely outdated especially since the |0 pictures | make |1 it | look nice and modern .
|0 It | had listed that there was a hot |0 breakfast | but |0 all | |0 this | meant is that |0 they | added a waffle |1 maker | to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
The family |0 suite | was basically two rooms with a small opening between them |0 which | worked great for us because |0 we | were two families traveling together .
If |0 you | are in town and need that |1 kind | of space |0 I | say stay here but if |0 you | are looking for a little more upscale affair do n't let the |1 pictures | fool |1 you | and book somewhere else .
"Great , and probably the only West Indian spot worth hitting up in Nashville ."
"I was born and raised in Toronto , |0 which | has a huge West Indian ( Trinidadian , Jamaican , etc ) |1 population | ."
"So huge in fact , that Toronto slang is influenced by and has Jamaican references , and Jamaican beef |0 patties | are staples in my high school cafeteria ."
"Anyway , I was practically raised on this stuff , and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine , Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American |1 palette | ."
"|0 All | |0 you | have to do to make |1 it | authentic Jamaican food , is add a whole |1 lot | of pepper ."
A lot .
The finest Christmas Trees |0 i | 've ever seen .
|0 I | felt like |0 I | was in heaven when |0 I | walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm .
The |0 trees | were in magnificent shape and the |0 variety | was astounding .
The |0 owners | were entertaining and gracious .
|0 I | especially liked the Eco friendly |1 atmosphere | and the owner s love of all animals .
|0 This | is one of the best farms |0 I | have ever been too .
|0 I | would call |1 it | the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
"|0 It | put |1 hair | on my chest and thanks to the owner s advice |0 I | invested |1 vanguard | , got |2 myself | a |1 woman | like Jerry , and became a republican ."
Thanks Tussey Mountain Tree Plantation !
Pho - nomenal !!
"|0 I | have been eating |1 Pho | for almost my entire life and |0 I | 've always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when |0 i | tried this pho |1 place | , |0 it | blew the other pho |1 houses | away !!"
"|0 all | of the pho places taste the |1 same | to me , so |0 what | seperates |1 one | from the other is the service and the price ."
The |0 service | here is incredible compared to the other places .
the only down |0 fall | of this pho house is the difficulty in finding |1 parking | in chinatown .
remember to bring |1 cash | since |0 they | do n't take |1 debit | or credit .
hope |0 this | helps !!
"Had a horrible |1 experience | with a manager here , Rachel McInnis , |0 she | was rude , inconsiderate and did not do the right |1 thing | for an item that was marked incorrectly ..."
|0 I | 'm not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... |0 she | refused to sell |2 me | the |1 item | at its marked price even after admitting |0 they | had made a |1 mistake | .
"|0 I | normally do n't write |1 reviews | but seeing that |0 I | considered |1 Dillards | a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this |0 one | wo n't be getting my |1 business | , nor my family 's , nor my co-workers ."
"|0 It | 's never ok to let a |1 customer | walk out unhappy , especially when |0 they | are right ."
Highly Recommend
|0 I | work as a Transformational Life Coach .
Since |0 this | is an alternative therapy |0 I | always refer |1 clients | to a lisenced therapist when |0 I | feel |0 that | is appropriate .
|0 I | found |1 her | through a colleague one day when |0 one | of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional |1 help | |1 that | |0 I | am not qualified to provide .
Little did |0 I | know that |0 I | would soon be needing her |1 help | as well !
"|0 She | guided |1 me | through a very difficult period dealing with a family member 's suicide , coupled with elder abuse ."
"|0 I | found |1 her | to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well ."
|0 I | would recommend |1 her | highly !
|0 They | wo n't have a second |1 chance | from me .
"First , let |1 me | state that although |0 I | live in NYC , |0 I | am not from NYC , |0 I | do n't care about baseball and |0 I | absolutely love |1 Boston | to death ( so beautiful , so clean , so awesome ) ."
"|0 That | said , |0 I | hated this |1 restaurant | ."
The |0 service | was just about as good as |0 I | 'd get in NYC ( |0 that | means |0 it | was poor ) and the |0 food | was almost mediocre .
The |0 decor | left a |1 lot | to be desired and the |0 posters | telling |2 me | all the |1 reasons | |0 99 | was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality .
Personally |0 I | recommend |0 you | take your |1 money | elsewhere
"When |0 I | arrived at Brickell Honda on 6/4/11 , I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner ."
|0 I | explained to him |1 what | |0 I | wanted and that |0 I | previously went to Braman Honda .
Bramen |0 Honda | was a bit of a hassle .
"|0 He | told |1 me | "" no problem , |0 we | will match the |1 offer | or do better . """
|0 Mr. | Guerra gave |2 me | a better |1 deal | without any hassles nor any type of problems .
Brickell |0 Honda | has been the best buying experience in the world .
|0 I | urge all St. Thomas the Apostle |1 parishioners | and all of South Florida residents to come see |1 Gus | !!!
Excellent customer service !!!
"Great , Honest Service"
|0 I | took my 2001 Nissan |1 Frontier | in to fix a cracked |1 manifold | .
The |0 dealer | wanted |1 $ | 1300 to fix |1 that | and another $ 1500 to fix some other |1 things | .
Eagle |0 Transmission | determined that |0 much | of the work the |0 dealer | said needed to be done was unneccesary and |0 what | needed to be fixed was only $ 400 !!
|0 I | was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission !
|0 I | dropped the |1 truck | off in the morning and |0 it | was ready that afternoon .
|0 I | have finally found a |1 mechanic | |0 I | trust !!
And it was great that |0 they | did not charge a service |1 fee | to diagnose the |1 problem | - an added bonus !!
Dr. Shady
|0 Kelly | hit the |1 nail | on the head .
""" |0 Dr. | Shady "" is a jerk ."
"After the way |0 she | spoke to me on my last visit , |0 I | will not be returning !!"
Good luck keeping |1 business | with that stuck up attitude Dr. Shady .
|0 You | have just lost |1 mine | .
"The next time |0 you | feel like being condescending to someone , |0 it | is not going to be me !!!!!!"
|0 Dr. | Shady is inexperienced and prideful .
|0 She | probably does not even have 10 |1 % | of the knowledge |1 that | |0 some | of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
|0 I | will be carefully researching |1 vets | before |0 I | take my |1 dog | someplace else .
"Beautifully written reviews Doctor , but completely UNTRUE ."
Poor Experience
|0 I | did not have a good |1 experience | w / Dr. Ghassemlou .
"During the session , |0 he | demanded to have my physical |1 address | , |1 which | |0 I | 've always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program ."
"|0 I | believe |0 he | is correct in that |0 he | needs my physical |1 address | for legal reasons , however , |0 he | did not adequately explain |1 this | during our session ."
|0 I | learned |1 more | about this doing my own |1 research | afterward .
|0 I | think |0 he | could 've done |1 more | to assuage my |1 concerns | by giving |2 me | concrete |1 facts | .
Saying that |0 I | need to give |2 him | my |1 address | or else |0 I | have intimacy |1 issues | is not helpful .
|0 It | 's pretty combative actually .
|0 you | 'll love |1 it |
|0 I | have had my |1 back | fused in 2 places .
|0 I | wish that |0 I | had n't done |1 this | .
"With these fusions , |0 chiropractric | is n't as successful , but |0 it | still is very helpful ."
"Even after my fusions , my |0 back | continued to hurt , but now |0 it | does n't hurt any more ."
"|0 I | would encourage |1 anyone | |0 who | is thinking of back surgery , to talk about different treatment options first with Dr. de Barros ."
|0 He | really knows what |0 he | is talking about and will approach the different |1 options | fairly .
"|0 You | can see different |1 treatments | |1 that | a |0 surgeon | ca n't see , so that |0 you | can have several treatment |1 options | before |0 you | decide |0 what | to do ."
Unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon !!!
|0 I | have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years .
|0 I | can not tell |1 you | how often I am complimented on my hair ( style AND color ) !
"|0 I | regularly request Kim 's business |1 cards | as I am often stopped on the street and asked "" |0 Who | does your |1 hair | ... |0 I | LOVE |1 it | !!! """
"Quaint , lovely , small salon with BIG personality ."
I am made to feel special when |0 I | am in the chair and |0 I | have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color |1 experience | .
"My |0 hair | has never felt this healthy , either ."
|0 I | can not recommend this |1 salon | enough !!!
Thanks Cheveux !
My Favorite in McLean
"My |0 family | loves coming to Endo Sushi . |0 They | are very nice , |0 it | is never crowded , and the |0 food | is wonderful , very delicious and fresh !"
"Sometimes it is hard to get |1 parking | in the lot in front of the storefront , and |0 it | is on a one - way street , but the |0 restaurant | itself is NEVER overcrowded ."
"If |0 you | can not park in the lot , then |0 you | can park in the shopping center 's garage , and walk up to Endo Sushi ."
The |0 service | is fast .
Be sure to ring the little |1 bell | on your way out if |0 you | enjoyed your |1 meal | !
"( |0 it | 's by the door , on the hostess stand )"
Horrible Service !
"|0 I | got yelled at , literally yelled at because |0 i | asked if |0 i | could pick up my |1 car | 5 - 10 minutes late ."
"|0 I | explained that |0 i | was already on my way and |0 i | would rush to get there as soon as |0 i | could because |0 i | needed my |1 car | for work at 5 am , but the |0 guy | was arguing with me saying |0 he | was gon na lock the |1 doors | right at 5:30 ."
"Rude , unprofessional , just jerks ."
"Seems like |0 all | |0 they | care about is the money and getting |1 home | on time , NO care for the customers AT ALL !!!"
Missed a whole |1 day | of work because |0 i | am now carless .
|0 I | will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again .
Superb Arrangements
|0 I | used Fancy |1 Flowers | for my late husband 's funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me .
"|0 I | am so glad that |0 I | called in to see |1 Ana | , |0 she | is a lovely girl |0 who | showed |1 nothing | but care and compassion towards me ."
"The |0 flowers | were all |1 that | |0 I | hoped |0 they | would be , |0 I | have attended several |1 funerals | of late unfortunately and the |0 flowers | |0 I | recieved from Ana outshone |1 them | all ."
"|0 She | is so talented , the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately , |0 it | is so obvious to see the |1 difference | between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others ."
Thank |2 you | |1 Ana | |0 I | hope to see |1 you | in the future under better circumstances .
Great first experience .
"|0 I | 'm 22 , and my |0 hairdresser | was great ( and not "" old "" like |0 one | of the reviews says ) - |0 she | really listened to what |0 I | wanted and gave |2 me | |1 tons | of tips on how to style my |1 hair | so |0 I | could get |1 it | to look the |1 way | |0 I | wanted |1 it | to ."
|0 She | deep conditioned my |1 hair | and took the |1 time | to style |1 it | properly .
|0 She | recommended |1 products | but absolutely did n't pressure |1 me | to buy .
"|0 It | 's a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere ."
|0 I | would highly recommend |1 it | and will be going back for my next haircut .
Oh !
"And |0 students | get |1 $ | 5 off , ca n't argue with that ."
Smoker s Haven
"Yeah , this |0 complex | is not very good ."
"Our bathroom |0 fan | , one electric outlet and 2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed ."
Both |0 bathrooms | look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and |0 they | slapped some |1 pieces | of wood over to try to cover |1 it | up .
And |0 non-smokers | beware !!!
|0 I | think 90 |0 percent | of the tenants are smokers !
"If |0 you | do not smoke , do not move here ."
Our |0 unit | reeks of old cigarette smoke and |0 it | started to become |1 apparent | a few weeks after |0 we | moved in .
|0 You | can not walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette |1 smoke | and |0 it | blows right into the windows all day and all night .
"Great Sanwiches , Great Prices"
|0 I | used to go here almost every day since |0 I | work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball |1 sandwiches | .
Chicken salad |0 salad | is great too .
"Best of all , the |0 staff | is quick on their feet and even with long lines , usually serve |1 you | in 5 minutes or less ."
"For the quality , the |0 prices | ( $ 4 - $ 6 ) have to be the best in town ."
The |0 staff | get to know |1 regulars | and do their |1 job | very well .
"|0 Tourists | like the other reviewer might not appreciate their |1 efficiency | or quality , but |0 I | certainly do ."
"|0 This | is n't a TGIF or Cafe , |0 it | s a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that ."
Rate a |1 church | ?
Might as well just hotpot the |1 curb | and rate the traffic |1 light | .
"|0 It | 's a bloody church , for chrisssake !"
"Big , grey and imposing ."
Go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure .
"The |0 pastor | at this church is cool , |0 I | met |1 him | after some holiday service ."
|0 He | had a |1 robe | that was made back in the '60s .
|0 God | was pleased with that one !
"|0 It | 's historical for Sf , so when your |0 aunte | comes for a visit , take |1 her | there ."
Great for the kiddies - |0 they | love the |1 labyrinth | ( do n't forget to tell |1 'em | |0 it | s really a ' pagen ' thing ! ) .
Stop by at least once or |0 you | 'll go to heck !
ok but just becuse |0 we | where on a tight budget .
|0 me | and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series .
|0 i | 'm a red sox fan so |0 i | was glad that the |0 phillies | won .
the knights |0 inn | was small very small . |0 i | mean 1 room in every room ! |0 it | was cozy a little and a small tv .
|0 i | mean a 2 day |0 stay | was a ok stay even tho the |0 manager | looked like |0 he | was chineze and that |0 we | only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New |1 York | .
but sice |0 we | almost just slept there |0 i | ca nt give that |1 good | of a review
|0 It | was a Saturday and my |0 spring | was broken ...
|0 I | googled Garage Door |1 Repair | in Woodinville and found |1 NDI | - |0 Johnette | answered the |1 phone | and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !
|0 She | sort of appologized for |0 Dan | taking the day off to go skiing - but |0 he | could do the |1 repair | on Sunday !
|0 I | said great and |0 Dan | arrived on time at 10 am to make the |1 repair | .
"|0 I | enjoyed speaking with Dan , and learning |1 more | about how the springs are sized for these doors ."
The |0 repair | went quickly and the |0 price | was extremely fair .
|0 I | would highly recommend |1 NDI | - and will spread the |1 word | to my neighbors .
Thanks Dan and Johnette for your responsiveness and professional service .
"Roger M. , Woodinville"
|0 I | would n't send my |1 dogs | there .
|0 I | had a |1 conversation | with the woman running this |1 place | in April 2010 .
|0 She | basically said if the |0 children | getting off the bus are n't paying to enter her |1 building | |0 she | was going to let |1 them | wander around the streets .
"Wow , really ?"
"With all the child |0 predators | out there , a busy road , |0 cars | speeding by ...... and |0 you | are going to let some 4 / 5 year |1 olds | wonder around cause |0 you | 're money hungry ?"
REAL CHRISTIAN OF YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Whether |0 they | pay |1 me | or not , if their |0 parents | get into an accident , stuck in traffic , etc. THE LAST |0 THING | |0 I | WOULD DO IS LET A |1 CHILD | GET RAPED BECAUSE I WAS N'T PAID ."
Excellent service
"|0 I | could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same |1 price | , but |0 I | go to the Garment District for their service ."
"Previous |0 reviewers | said |0 they | were pushy and |0 I | can understand |1 that | , but |0 I | find the |1 staff | more helpful than anything else ."
|0 Tiffany | is fabulous !
"|0 I | came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told |1 her | about a stain |0 I | had on my new leather purse ."
"|0 She | immediately went to the back , brought out leather |1 cleaner | and cleaned my |1 purse | on the spot ."
|0 I | did n't even buy the |1 bag | there !
"Huge selection and , great suggestions from the staff and |0 they | refer |1 you | to reliable places if |0 they | do n't have |1 what | |0 you | need ."
"|0 We | were expecting a great |1 experience | , when |0 we | recieved a friendly |1 greeting | by the hosts ."
The |0 atmosphere | was nice and very clean .
The |0 menu | had |1 plenty | of options even for picky eaters .
"The |0 service | was ok , our |0 waitress | kept forgetting our |1 drinks | even though |0 we | reminded |1 her | several times ."
"To start |0 we | tried the |1 guacamole | and salsa verde , |0 it | was completly flavorless ."
|0 We | should have left then .
"|0 We | orderd our |1 meals | anyway , chimichangas , jalapeno borritos , and quesadillas ."
"|0 Everything | was bland , completely void of any spice or flavor ."
"|0 We | have never had mexican |1 food | this bad , |0 it | was just simply gross ."
Hopefully |0 they | spice |1 things | up or |0 they | wo nt be in business long .
|0 I | recommend La |1 Hacienda |
Might try again
"Pros : * |0 Jill | , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , |0 I | like !"
Do n't know where else |0 you | can find Purple Hull |1 Peas | and some of the other sides .
"Cons : * |0 Server | was n't very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time , took about 25 |1 minutes | from ordering to eating ."
Half the |0 tables | and bar were empty by this point .
Other Thoughts : Will try this |1 place | again .
There must be a |0 reason | so many |0 people | like it there .
"Their Club |0 sandwich | looks tasty , maybe |0 that | 'll change my |1 mind | .... and a different server ."
very professional / very helpful
the |0 people | at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful .
|0 i | was looking for a car but did not really know |1 what | |0 i | wanted and |0 they | were very helpful and took the |1 time | to first figure out what my |0 needs | were and showing |2 me | various |1 options | to meet those |1 needs | .
|0 they | seemed more interested in helping |1 me | find the right |1 car | rather then just make a |1 sale | .
"my |0 experience | with them was great - low stress , very helpful and very personal ."
after finding the |1 car | |0 i | wanted |0 they | took the |1 time | to go over each step and making |1 it | as painless as possible .
from start to finish |0 they | were top notch .
|0 i | would highly recommend calling these |1 people | up for your next car .
This insurance |0 co. | Is a joke !!!
|0 They | have absolutely no communication |1 skills | whatsoever .
"if |0 you | do n't mind being robbed , cheated or lied to then |0 this | is the company for you ."
|0 They | will make every |1 attempt | to misinform and misrepresent |1 themselves | .
|0 They | make up |1 excuses | in hopes to confuse their policy |1 holders | with misinformation .
as an example |0 they | took |1 payment | for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the |1 contract | for the remainder of the policy for reasons |0 they | stated was not receiving |1 information | on other licensed drivers in the household ?
|0 I | personally provided the |1 request | on four separate occasions and |0 they | claim there is a |0 glitch | in their systems ?
|0 Ifa | is an acronym for |0 I | m a F%#king Assh@%$e !!!
Fantastic Service !
"|0 I | have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my |1 tires | , alignment and state inspection done yesterday ."
|0 I | shopped |1 it | around and |0 they | were extremely competitive in pricing and also added |1 nitrogen | to my tires |0 which | should extend the |1 life | and get |2 me | better gas |1 mileage | .
|0 It | also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires !
|0 What | made |1 it | perfect was that |0 they | offered |1 transportation | so that |0 I | would not have to wait there or take |1 time | off of work to go back and forth or try to find a |1 ride | .
"Great service , great pricing and SUPER CONVENIENT !"
|0 I | also did not feel like |0 they | tried to sell |2 me | a |1 bunch | of services |1 that | |0 I | did not need .
Love my |1 home | at Creekside
|0 I | moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extended |1 it | for another 13 months !
"The |0 management | from Julie and Janice to the work staff , esp. Edwin , are just wonderful ."
|0 They | have been extremely helpful whenever |0 I | have asked for help .
"Although the |0 apartments | are facing Stokes |1 Street | and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the |0 location | is surprisingly quiet ."
|0 I | have never had any |1 problems | with loud neighbors or concerns about safety .
"The |0 apartments | are within walking distance to Trader Joe 's , Whole Foods , and other stores ."
"The well - equipped , clean |0 gym | is a plus !"
Great place to live if |0 you | work in and around downtown San Jose !
|0 I | interviewed several |1 contractors | for a kitchen remodel .
"Liberty |0 construction | shows up and |0 it | 's two guys ... |0 all | |0 I | get is 100 % sales pitch "" |0 We | 're the best ... |0 we | 're number 50 so |0 we | must be doing |1 something | right ... look at all these certificates |0 that | say |0 we | 're great "" ."
"Not once did |0 I | feel listened to like |0 they | actually cared about what |0 I | wanted , |0 all | |0 they | were interested in was |0 me | signing a |1 contract | right then and there ."
Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service .
|0 I | 'm glad |0 I | trusted my |1 gut | and did n't get sucked into doing |1 business | with them .
Find |1 someone | |0 you | trust |0 that | actually hears |1 you | and wants to do the |1 job | right .
Do n't waste your |1 time | or money !
"|0 I | took my 3 year old |1 son | here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , |0 I | thought |0 it | was rubbish and overpriced ."
"Even taking into account the |1 fact | that my 3 year |0 old | wanted to run |1 most | of the way round , |0 it | took |2 us | just over one |1 hour | start to finish ."
If |0 you | have been to the London Aquarium |0 I | would not even bother with this .
If |0 you | are really desperate for something to pass the |1 time | and are willing to shell out the best |1 part | of £ 30 for 2 two people then go for it .
( For some reason |0 it | will not let |1 me | rate |1 it | one star - it is not rated 5 by me ! )
Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : |0 I | could not recommend |1 Dr | David Nelson enough .
|0 I | had a severe |1 phobia | of attending the |1 dentist | until |0 I | met and was treated by |1 Dr | Nelson .
|0 He | instantaneously put |1 me | at ease and his ongoing |0 treatments | have been absolutely pain free .
My previous apprehension has been dismissed and |0 I | no longer have a sinking |1 feeling | when my next |0 appointment | is due !
"In addition to the core treatment , |0 Dr | Nelson has impressed |1 me | further with his concern and interest in the well - being of his patients – his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient ."
|0 He | is always prepared to go the extra |1 mile | to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately –

Best Salsa ( hehehe )
"After my trees were cleaned up , |0 they | gave |2 me | a |1 jar | of salsa ."
"The |0 owner | warned |1 me | that |0 it | was the best salsa |0 I | would ever had , and |0 he | was right ."
No joke !
"|0 I | hate to say check |1 them | out just for the salsa , but James , |0 I | NEED another |1 jar | badly :) All kidding aside , |0 they | are a very good company , |0 I | have a hard |1 time | giving any service |2 biz | a 5 star |1 review | but |0 they | came close ."
Very affordable ( do n't call |1 it | cheap ) and their |0 trimmers | were quick and courteous when |0 I | got home from work .
"And the salsa , be sure to ask for a jar and have |1 plenty | of chips around , |0 you | will need |1 them | ....."
|0 Dr. | Mann killed our |1 pet |
"Yea , |0 Dr. | Mann ai n't so great ."
|0 We | took our beloved |1 kitty | to him and |0 it | came back dead .
|0 We | live in the sub-division around the corner and after |0 it | happened and |0 we | brought |1 it | up at some neighborhood gatherings |0 we | discovered that several |0 people | from this neighborhood alone had |1 pets | go to Dr. Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead .
"If |0 you | take |1 him | here for shots , no big deal but |0 I | would never let this |1 man | apply |1 anesthetic | to my pet ever again ."
"Oh , |0 they | also charged |1 me | for the procedure ( |1 $ | 250 ) AND had the |1 audacity | to charge |2 me | a $ 25 ' DISPOSAL ' |1 fee | ."
|0 They | actually itemized |1 it | as a DISPOSAL fee .
AVOID AT ALL COSTS .
One of the worst places
This |0 place | and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from .
"the |0 food | was horrible not cooked like |0 it | should be , |0 they | got the |1 order | wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order ."
"|0 i | had to call back up there two hours later and the |0 lady | ( |0 who | claimed to be a manager ) said my |0 food | was on the way , and |0 she | did nt offer to compensate |1 me | in any kind of way ."
|0 i | waited another 30 |1 mins | before receiving my |1 food | and |0 it | was cold .
"in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector , and |0 anyone | |0 who | is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant ."
Gone downhill since change in ownership
Sigh .
|0 I | used to LOVE this |1 place | .
"But now that |0 they | are part of a chain , |0 service | has slipped ."
"|0 I | am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time |0 I | parked with them , |0 they | lost my car |1 key | ."
Lucky |0 I | had a |1 spare | with me !
To date |0 they | have not made good by either finding the |1 key | or paying for a new one .
"( These new car |0 keys | are EXPENSIVE to copy , |0 you | ca n't just go to WalMart . )"
Go to the website for coupons and join the |1 club | - |0 you | can get free |1 parking | .
"However , with |0 BNA | offering one |1 day | of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility , |0 it | may be cheaper to park at BNA ."
|0 Wife | and I attempted to adopt a |1 dog | and was nothing but frustrating .
|0 We | arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a |1 do | |0 we | really liked .
We were told that |0 we | could n't today because |0 they | were closing soon .
|0 I | called the next morning to let |1 then | know my |0 wife | would be driving in .
|0 They | gave |2 me | the run |1 around | and missing paperwork only to call back to tell |2 me | |0 someone | else wanted |1 her | and |0 I | would need to come in and put down a |1 deposit | .
|0 I | work 2 hours away but offered my |1 card | over the phone .
|0 They | refused .
Terrible communication as well .
"At one point |0 they | told |2 me | the dog had been fixed , the next day |0 it | had n't ."
Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure .
|0 College | is a Joke and the |0 Salon | is a JOKE !
Went to the school here OVER PRICED !!!!!!
|0 You | do NOT learn the |1 things | you were promised .
|0 You | have to bring in your own |1 models | and |0 they | have to pay for |0 you | to use |1 them | if |0 you | do nt then |0 you | can graduate !
Going back after graduating you r told |0 you | get a |1 discount | on services nope |0 you | do nt .
|0 Staff | is under educated .
Going there |0 you | learn the |0 school | does not care about the services given just about the money .
Over priced for |0 students | to learn !
Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail |1 drill | AT ALL |0 you | learn the old fashioned |1 way | of doing |1 nails | |0 you | will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
BEWARE !
|0 You | can fool |1 people |
This |0 store | is proof that |0 you | can fool |1 people | with good advertising .
"|0 They | convince |1 lots | of people that |0 they | are a great store , when in fact |0 they | are a very average place at best , |0 they | are just another big box store like the others ."
"|0 They | offer |1 sales | |0 that | are n't really sales , mislabeled items |0 that | make the |0 item | sound like a good deal when |0 it | is n't , a bad attitude about return items , and on and on ."
With higher than average prices to boot !
"So do n't get taken in , keep your |1 eyes | open if |0 you | choose to shop here ."
"On the other hand , the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work , its community action , and its interest in the public welfare ."
Never again
"Do n't go here unless |0 you | want to sit , order , eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes ."
|0 You | wo n't even have |1 time | to read the entire |1 menu | before being asked to order and if |0 you | ask for more time your |0 server | will wait at the table .
|0 This | is the only place |0 I | have ever eaten and been told to leave because other |0 people | were waiting .
I was told to take my |1 coffee | to go if |0 I | wanted to finish |1 it | .
"Oh , and their liquor |0 license | was expired so no Bloody Mary or Mimosas ."
"Plus the |0 drinks | are self service , have |1 fun | trying to negotiate the small cafeteria |1 space | to get your |1 coffee | , juice or water ."
Go next |1 door | to the Ball Square Cafe instead .
|0 I | guess |0 you | get what |0 you | pay for .
"|0 I | tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend , so |0 we | asked for a single queen bed ."
"|0 We | got there , and we were treated to the free "" upgrade "" of a room with two double beds ."
"Since |0 they | consider |1 this | an upgrade , |0 they | let their other |1 rooms | fill up and would not change our |1 room | ."
Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
|0 We | could hear every single |1 thing | |0 that | happened outside like |0 it | was inside our room .
"When |0 I | finally found |1 someone | at the desk |0 who | could speak |1 English | , |0 they | moved our |1 room | , but |0 we | still did not receive the single |1 queen | |0 we | had "" reserved """
|0 I | was thoroughly impressed !
|0 I | had a |1 problem | with the |0 tile | in my bathroom coming apart .
"|0 I | called a few different |1 businesses | in the area to get |1 estimates | , |0 they | were n't the cheapest |0 I | found but very reasonable ."
The best |0 part | is |0 I | got my whole |1 bathroom | remodeled for about the same price the other |0 company's | were quoting just to fix the shower |1 tile | and fixtures .
|0 They | had the |1 work | done in about half the time quoted |0 which | made |1 me | and my wife extremely happy .
|0 We | have had |1 nothing | but compliments on our bathroom when |0 guest | come over - |0 who | would have guessed that |1 one | ?
Very nice work and friendly guys too .
Best money |0 I | 've spent on remodeling ever .
|0 I | highly recommend any |1 one | considering home |1 repair | to give these |2 guys | a |1 call | .
New training |0 Centre | is excellent
The Award Dance |0 Centre | has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull .
The new |0 Centre | has 4 |1 studios | planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor |1 area | in Kingston upon Hull .
"The |0 classes | cover all age and skill |1 ranges | , with BALLROOM , LATIN , SEQUENCE , STREET , DISCO , LINE DANCING , BALLET , TAP & JAZZ ."
|0 We | have attended A Ward Dance |1 Centre | for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming |1 way | we are taught |1 Ballroom | and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening ....
"It is not really possible to score this |1 school | too highly , |0 We | would give |2 it | |1 12 | out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne"
|0 I | purchased a 2 - year old certified pre-owned |1 BMW | from this dealership .
"The night |0 I | drove back home , |0 I | found that the rear |0 window | has some |1 leakage | ."
( |0 You | can hear the |1 wind | while driving on highway .
Very likely |0 it | needs a new window |1 seal | ) .
|0 I | admit that |0 I | should have paid |1 attention | to this kind of little things while test drive .
( But |0 this | is a certified car from a dealer . )
So |0 I | brought the |1 car | back the second day .
|0 They | told |1 me | that |0 this | is not under warranty and want to charge |2 me | |1 $ | 175 just to diagnose the |1 problem | !
|0 Who | knows how much |0 they | want |1 me | to pay to fix this |1 thing | .
|0 I | walked away .
So my |0 advice | is that NEVER TRUST THIS |1 DEALER | .
STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE .
Perfect Practice
After |0 I | had chosen The Fountain Dental |1 Practice | |0 they | provided a slick and professional |1 service | from start to finish .
"|0 Everyone | was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting |1 me | at my ease and explaining the whole |1 process | , both initially and then as |0 we | went along ."
Surgery visit timings were always made to suit |1 me | and not them and |0 they | gave |2 me | the |1 feeling | that |0 I | mattered and was important to them .
"The |0 surgery | itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and |0 I | always felt that |0 I | was in capable hands ."
"My dental |0 surgeon | , Dr. Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work |0 she | does and the reputation |0 she | has established ."
|0 Everyone | was so helpful that |0 I | can not wait to go back .....

Wonderful service for large group
"|0 I | had my wedding |1 luncheon | at this BJ s restaurant , and |0 it | was one of the best choices |1 that | |0 I | made ."
"|0 It | was a great deal -- |0 we | paid a certain |1 amount | per person , and my |0 husband | and I chose 4 |1 types | of pizza and the |0 servers | brought out as |1 much | as |0 we | wanted ."
We were also served |1 salad | and soda .
"|0 We | had a large |1 party | , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and |0 we | all had a wonderful |1 time | ."
"Even though |0 we | were only supposed to have those specific |1 types | of pizza , when |0 guests | asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !"
|0 I | really appreciate |1 BJ | s for making that special |1 day | even better with their wonderful food and service .
wonderful
|0 I | went to ohm after reading |1 some | of the reviews .
|0 I | go to school in the area and usually wait until |0 I | go home to get my |1 hair | cut .
|0 I | decided |0 it | was time to grow up and made an |1 appointment | .
|0 Sierra | was my stylist and |0 i | love |1 what | |0 she | did .
|0 I | have wavy |1 hair | and |0 she | cut to my hair style .
|0 It | was the first time |0 i | had left a |1 salon | with my |0 hair | curly .
Usually |0 they | blow dry |1 it | out and |0 i | have to wait until |0 i | wash |1 it | to see what |0 it | will look like in its natural state .
But |0 she | did a fabulous |1 job | letting |1 me | know |1 what | |0 she | was doing at all times and styled my |1 hair | in a way |0 i | could do |1 it | at home .
|0 It | was n't completly impossible !!!!
|0 I | am definitely going back
"After recently relocating to South Bend , |0 we | were looking for a delicious , fun , yet elegant establishment for New Year s Eve dinner ."
"|0 We | were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the Jazz Club ."
"The |0 meal | was extremely overpriced and lacked |1 flavor | , especially for being a special NYE menu ."
The limited |0 menu | had few appetizing |1 options | and the NYE special |0 packages | were way overpriced .
"After our meal , our |0 server | found |2 us | a |1 table | in the jazz club where we were informed |0 it | would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact |0 we | had just finished a |1 dinner | there and were intending to enjoy their drink |1 list | ."
|0 This | was a less than impressive experience at Trio 's .
Run for the hills ... |0 you | 'll be much better off !
One |0 night | was too much .
First |0 room | had used |1 tissues | next to the bed and |0 I | requested it be rectified .
"I was then moved to another room around the back where the |0 room | was dirty , the |0 shower | was dirty with other people s hair in it , the toilet |0 seat | was peeling and rough and the |0 bathroom | was full of mould ."
"|0 I | called |1 reception | to ask if |0 they | knew the |1 state | the |0 room | was in and was told "" |0 This | is a Days Inn , not the Hilton "" and the |0 receptionist | then hung up on me ."
To warn |1 you | to stay away from this place just is n't enough .
There was not one |0 ounce | of caring involved and anyone |0 I | can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
Grocery and Daily Needs Store
Before using |1 FusionRetail | Before installing |1 FusionRetail | |0 store | was running on a dos based software .
|0 We | were having a major |1 problem | in maintaining |1 cash | .
"Being a grocery shop , maintaining 5000 different |1 products | was a challenging job ."
Managing POS |1 counter | without barcoding was really a tough time .
How |0 FusionRetail | has overcome these |1 issues | ?
|0 FusionRetail | helps |1 us | to maintain the |1 store | in an organised way .
"|0 Usage | of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale , purchase and returns was never easy before ."
How long does it take to train new |1 people | at work ?
|0 Billing | takes 15 |1 minutes | and back office |0 jobs | takes 1 day 's |1 training | How fast your support queries get answered ?
"Over telephone , immediate ."
"On call , it takes a day to get our |1 issues | resolved ."
Ca n't wait to go back !!!
|0 This | is by far the BEST B&B that |0 we | have ever stayed at !
|0 We | were in Santa Fe for a special event and our |0 hosts | rented out the El |1 Paradero | for all their |0 guests | to stay at .
"|0 We | could not have been more welcomed , more comfortable or more well fed ."
"The |0 weekend | was perfect in every way , in large part to Sue and her great staff ."
|0 Everyone | was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure |0 everything | went well .
"|0 We | can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B&B ... especially my 4 year |1 old | , |0 who | made |1 friends | with Ms. Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since |0 we | left !"
|0 We | would highly recommend the El |1 Paradero | on your next trip to Santa Fe !
"Disatisfied customer , |0 I | went through Kitchen Aid and used |1 one | of their recommended vendors ."
"|0 A&E | came out , charged $ 129 |1 fee | just to walk in the door ."
"|0 I | needed a |1 part | for my appliance , the |0 cost | was very high so |0 I | said never mind , paid the |1 fee | and called a local |1 business | for a second quote ."
The second |0 vendor | charged |1 $ | 55 ( less than half of what |0 A&E | charges ) to come and applied |1 that | to the price of the repair service ( |1 which | |0 A&E | does not ) .
Their |0 quote | came in at half the price of A&E for the same work and same part .
Seems to me like |0 A&E | charges way |1 more | than necessary !
"Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well , |0 I | thought that |0 they | pre-screened their |1 vendors | for price and quality of work , obviously |0 they | do not !"

"First let |1 me | start out by saying , that |0 I | have had very nice |1 pedicures | at Lovely Nails on Military Road ."
"|0 I | was very excited that a |0 salon | was opening in Lewiston , as |0 I | live in Youngstown ."
|0 I | was in two weeks ago and had the worst |1 pedicure | |1 that | |0 I | have had in my life .
There were |0 four | of us and I was taken first by a gentleman .
|0 I | put my |1 foot | in the water and |0 it | was cool .
|0 He | did warm |1 it | up .
|0 He | also hurt my |1 toes | will pushing my |1 cuticles | back .
"If the |0 pedicure | lasted 20 |1 mins. | , |0 that | was a stretch ."
"The other |0 ladies | had a similar |1 experience | , |0 both | had nail |1 polish | on a couple of toes ."
"|0 None | of us will be using their |1 services | again , |0 which | is a shame ."
Good Service - Limited Results
|0 Andrew | was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re : infertility .
|0 He | was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a |1 plan | of action .
"The office is shared with a foot doctor and |0 it | 's very sterile and medical feeling , |1 which | |0 I | liked ."
The down |0 side | was that sometimes there was a |0 lot | of noise in the hallway from other patients / doctors .
|0 I | worked with Andrew for 2 months and did |1 acupuncture | and herbs .
The |0 sessions | were nice and |0 I | felt relaxed after them but did not notice any |1 changes | with my cycles .
"|0 I | know |0 it | can take a |1 while | for results and did n't expect a |1 miracle | , but after 2 months |0 I | felt like |0 it | was not entirely worth the |1 cost | / time ."
( |0 I | am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ... )
"Friendly , clean and excellent location"
"The |0 staff | was very helpful , and gave |2 us | good |1 advice | on day and night time activities ."
"Common |0 room | was comfortable and clean , very good room to read or relax . –"
A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9:30 am ; yummy fresh Parisian croissants .
"Comfortable and clean beds , a bit noisy when |0 people | were coming in late from a night out , but |0 we | did n't mind too much as |0 we | were also just coming in from a night out !"
The |0 location | is really stellar !
|0 It | is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur |0 which | is excellent for shopping .
"|0 It | is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market ."
|0 We | really enjoyed our |1 stay | and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again .
Just Autos Thank |1 you | !
"Was fast and easy , Just had our |1 car | returned this morning , |0 I | would recommend these Mobile |1 Mechanics | for sure ."
|0 They | certainly know |1 what | |0 they | are doing .
"The |0 mechanic | came to our place and sorted out our car s |1 problems | , |0 he | explained the |1 problem | and was very up front and honest , it was towed to the workshop as the |0 gearbox | was not working ( |0 he | explained |1 it | better ) ."
"|0 They | phoned the same day , confirmed |0 it | was the gearbox quoted |2 me | the |1 job | , |0 I | gave the go |1 ahead | ."
Now my car s |0 gears | and brakes have never run so well ... ever |0 it | s like driving a new |1 car | .
"So yes , |0 I | would n't hesitate in recommending the |1 team | at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs , Thank |1 you | Just Autos for your help ."
|0 I | stopped in today @ Yards Brewery .
"|0 I | must say , |0 I | was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge , & |0 I | liked that |0 you | could see the |1 brewery | right thru the glass !"
"|0 I | had a |1 sampler | of IPA , Brawler , Love Stout & ESA ."
"|0 All | were awesome , & |0 I | had a Dogwood Grilled |1 Cheese | |0 which | was enjoyable with the fine beers ."
"After my sampler & sandwich , |0 I | asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout , |0 I | must say |0 I | was impressed , with the great taste & |0 I | am a Guiness Lover so coming from me , |0 I | think |0 this | is better , |0 it | s less dry & smoother !"
If |0 you | are in Philly |0 you | have to come check this |1 place | out !
The only |0 negative | |0 I | have abou this place is the parking !
|0 I | left with a case of BRAWLER !!!! !
Oil Change Disaster
My |0 wife | had taken her '07 Ford |1 Fusion | in for a routine oil change .
"A couple days after the oil change , the |0 engine | ran rough , the low oil pressure |0 light | would come on sporadically , and the |0 engine | would whir loudly ."
"Turns out the |0 engine | had no |1 oil | , and when oil was put it , |0 it | would just run out of the filter ."
There could have ( hopefully does n't have ) major |1 damage | to the engine .
|0 All | of this started after their oil change .
Once |0 they | realized their |1 mistake | |0 they | sent a |1 mechanic | and tow truck to my wife 's work and towed |1 it | back to fix |1 it | .
"|0 I | would not recommend this |1 shop | for anything , not even something as simple as an oil change ."
"Plus |0 they | will overcharge |1 you | for just about everything , and smile while doing |1 it | ."
"Liars , negative stars !"
Took my |1 Cruze | in twice for poor fuel economy .
The first time |0 they | claimed to get reasonable |1 mpg | .
"However , |0 they | would never drive the |1 car | with |0 me | in it to prove their |1 findings | ."
|0 I | wonder if |0 they | were going down a hill !
|0 They | told |2 me | to bring |1 it | back after 5000 miles .
|0 I | brought |1 it | back with 9000 miles .
"|0 They | "" finished "" the |1 work | and told |2 me | the |0 car | was ready ."
"|0 I | found out |0 they | did not even drive the |1 car | , stated |0 they | looked at it before ."
|0 They | still would not drive the |1 car | with me to show their mpg |1 number | .
"|0 They | also claimed not to see |1 anything | wrong with the blower fan ( a seperate issue ) , but when |0 I | drove the |1 car | home |0 I | had the same |1 symptoms | ."
|0 I | will never purchace another |1 vehicle | from Vic Canever .
Great Job
|0 I | want to say that |0 Mike | did a great |1 job | for our family in our time of need .
Both my |0 grandparents | passed away 4 months apart and |0 Mike | was very understanding .
|0 It | was a very trying time for my family and myself yet |0 Mike | took the |1 time | to greet each and every one |1 one | of us .
|0 He | is very professional in his position as a director and yet |0 he | still made |1 time | to be compassionate for what |0 we | were all going through .
|0 I | 'm sure it s not every day that a funeral |0 director | sees the same |1 family | in such a short time .
"My |0 grandfather | passed away silently in his sleep , and my |0 grandmother | passed away after a short struggle with cancer ."
Both my |0 grandparents | looked as natural as could be expected .
Thank |1 you | Mike for all your help professionally and personally .

Poor service
"If |0 you | like the |1 drama | described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ' , |0 you | will see |1 it | here ."
|0 We | signed our |1 name | in about 6:00 pm .
There were 3 |0 names | before us .
The |0 greeter | said there was about 15 minutes |0 waiting | .
"However , |0 we | waited and waited and in the mean time , saw 4 |0 groups | of people simply just paraded in without signing there |1 names | ."
"This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant “ no reservation , sign your |1 name | here ” ."
"|0 I | had to ask the |1 greeter | , |0 he | explained his |1 reasons | with broken English ."
|0 I | could not understand any his |1 reasons | .
|0 I | could only take it as |0 they | would seat the |1 people | |0 they | know first .
My |0 conclusion | is that |0 you | should only go there if |0 you | want to wait a least an hour and see all |1 kinds | other people being seated before you .
|0 Instructor | never showed up !
"January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday 's 2 PM class "" Beginning Yoga with Brittany . """
|0 We | even arrived 10 minutes early as the |0 website | suggests .
The |0 instructor | did not show up !
|0 We | waited until 2:25 PM and then left .
"There were |0 2 | in our group , and a 3rd |0 person | was also in the parking lot waiting for this class ."
"Well , not much |0 I | can say except |0 I | 'm very disappointed with this experience ."
|0 This | was our first visit to your studio .
"In today 's instant world , there 's no |0 reason | for the instructor not to even have given |2 us | a phone |1 call | or e-mail if |0 she | was going to be late ."
"As a yoga studio , |0 I | 'm sure |0 you | 're all aware that all |0 actions | generate |1 karma | …"
and sometimes |0 karma | can manifest |1 itself | on a bad review on Google .
Finest ??
Really ??
|0 I | beg to differ .
This |0 place | is marginal at best .
Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little |1 kids | entertained .
"|0 I | was not impressed , and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses ."
"|0 I | understand not wanting to put |1 labels | like 5.10 on an indoor course , because yes , |0 it | is not the same , but some clear |0 understanding | of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when |0 you | are an intermediate climber looking to improve ."
"|0 I | do n't want to waste my |1 time | on routes set for children , but |0 I | do n't want to take on |1 something | |0 I | ca n't handle just to strain |1 myself | to exhaustion ."
"Rate the |1 routes | , with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy , moderate , and hard ."
"Again , a great outing for the kids , a frustration for an out of town climber ."
Best DJ's In Town !
Wow !
These |0 guys | were the best .
"|0 They | were thorough , high class , and went above and beyond ."
"|0 We | never had to worry about a thing , and |0 they | led the |1 way | the whole time ."
"|0 They | asked |2 us | |1 things | that |0 we | would have never have thought of , and took extra |1 time | to meet with us when |0 we | needed |1 it | before the wedding ."
Having a |1 team | was the best because |0 they | kept the |1 flow | of the wedding going the whole time !
"|0 They | may look young but do n't let |1 that | fool |1 you | , as their |0 knowledge | of music far surpassed |1 what | |0 we | expected ."
"|0 I | am a music junkie |0 that | grew up in the 80's , and my |0 dad | worked for a record label in the 1960's ."
So |0 we | did n't expect |1 them | to even know |1 some | of the requests |1 that | |0 we | asked that night .
|0 They | just really know their |1 stuff | !
NEVER fear going to the dentist again !
|0 I | 'm 61 years old and have dental |1 problems | my entire life .
By the age of 24 |0 I | stopped going to the dentist .
My |0 fear | and discomfort from dental work scared |1 me | !
It took all the |1 courage | |0 I | could muster to make an |1 appointment | .
"At the front door of his office , |0 I | nearly turned around ."
|0 I | considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did .
|0 Doctor | Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people |0 I | have ever dealt with .
"|0 They | made |0 me | feel confident in what |0 they | would do , and treated |1 me | like a member of their own family ."
|0 I | never felt |1 pain | or discomfort .
The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life .
"Thank |2 you | |1 Doctor | Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !"

HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD
"not only is this |0 place | too expensive for what |0 it | is , |0 it | s horrible !"
"In the past , |0 I | got a |1 steak | and there was more |0 fat | and rough pieces than there was good |0 steak | ( and |0 this | was the sirloin ! ) , the sides were drenched with butter and the |0 salad | was a little on the brown side ."
"Today |0 we | went for a party ( during lunch , so the |0 place | was empty ) with about 25 other people ."
It took over 1.5 |1 hours | for our |0 food | to come out and by that time my 8 |0 month | old had |1 it | !
Does |0 it | seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
"|0 I | was a waitress for years and a key |0 rule | is to serve |1 customers | with small children before others , as |0 I | was the last to get my |1 food | ."
|0 I | would NOT recommend having a |1 party | here or even going here .
Texas |0 Roadhouse | is WAY better !!
Spay and neuter service .
|0 I | have no |1 doubt | that the |0 rescue | is wonderful .
"But |0 I | had my |0 cat | spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the |0 vet | |0 they | sent |1 us | to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later |0 we | had to bring |1 them | to our normal vet because the |0 vets | at the place in wisconsin did a crappy |1 job | and |0 they | got |1 infections | ."
"My |0 vet | even said |0 it | was not my fault |0 it | was the vet |0 that | did the |1 surgery | , So |0 I | would not recommend getting that |1 program | unless |0 you | have an extra hundred |1 dollars | or so for antibiotics and a vet visit ."
|0 You | 'd think |0 they | would do a good |1 job | but |0 they | do n't care unless they are getting paid full |1 price | .
|0 Which | is so dumb .
Not to mention the fact that |0 they | gave |2 us | our |1 cats | back not even 30 minutes after |0 they | were out from surgery .
Billing Issues ...
|0 I | had a routine |1 surgery | for an ingrown toenail .
"My insurance |0 company | , Blue Cross / Blue Shield paid the |1 fees | and |0 everything | was fine ."
Then |0 I | got a |1 bill | for $ 483.00 .
"The doctor 's |0 office | said that payments had been "" reversed "" ."
Blue |0 cross | has no |1 record | of aa reversal .
The |0 office | refused my |1 requests | to see |1 what | |0 they | got from BC / BS .
|0 They | eventually turned |1 it | over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the |1 matter | .
"|0 I | eventually decided to just pay the |1 balance | even though the doctor has already been paid , but now the collection |0 agency | is trying to say another |0 reversal | of $ 160.00 has come through ."
|0 It | was an ingrown toenail .
How much could |0 it | possibly cost ?
"Not only am I being bilked for money |0 I | do not owe , the office |0 staff | is rude to boot ."
|0 I | think this |0 office | has some serious billing practice |1 issues | !
"We have been blessed to find Elite |1 Flyers | online and would not use |1 anyone | else to handle our |1 postcards | , posters , etc ."
|0 We | were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started .
|0 They | have the best |1 rates | and GREAT customer service .
"On one order , |0 we | needed |0 it | rushed and shipped to a different state ."
|0 They | did |1 that | with no problem .
|0 I | also appreciate their |1 honesty | .
|0 I | sent a |1 graphic | that would have been distorted if printed as |0 it | was .
|0 They | called and worked with me to fix |1 it | so that |0 it | would look perfect .
|0 They | recently surprised |1 me | a larger order .
"|0 I | ordered 1000 |1 postcards | , |0 we | normally order |1 5000 | or more ."
"Because |0 they | had |1 room | to do |1 5000 | , |0 they | created the larger |1 amount | , and shipped |1 them | early ."
|0 I | recommend this |1 company | to ANYONE and everyone |0 that | needs great |1 work | done at a reasonable rate !
|0 They | have a |1 customer | for life in us !
sheisters
|0 i | made the |1 mistake | of buying from these thieves .
|0 I | paid 2 k |1 cash | for a truck with a blown motor .
"Their so called |0 mechanic | said the |0 engine | was good and "" There is |0 nothing | mechanicly wrong with this truck "" ."
Well |0 I | think a blown |0 engine | falls under the catagory of mechanics right ?
Anyway |0 they | jimmy rigged |1 it | so |0 i | could drive |1 it | home .
"The next day |0 i | took |1 it | to 2 auto shops and |0 they | both told |2 me | the same |1 thing | , |0 engine | is junk ."
|0 I | called and got the same |1 runaround | on hold and |0 noone | calls |1 you | back .
"From a moral standpoint , you |0 guys | are really gon na take 2,000 |1 bucks | from someone |0 that | needs that |1 truck | to work and support his |1 family | when |0 you | know |0 it | s just a piece of scrap metal ?"
If |0 it | lasted 1 month |0 i | could suck it up but 1 day ?
Grimy work you |0 guys | do .
Buy your |2 kids | |1 somethin | nice with my 2 k bucks .
Best Stationery store in Bethesda
"|0 Papeluna | , a cute Mom / Pop custom printing and paper store , just opened a few days ago ."
|0 It | is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but |0 some | might miss |1 it | as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell 's .
|0 I | popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks .
|0 It | 's an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness .
"Cards , wrapping paper , paper , and an area to sit down and talk with someone to design your own |1 invitations | or for whatever else your custom printing |0 needs | may be ."
"|0 I | gave the |2 woman | |0 I | spoke with today a "" You 've been yelped ! "" |1 card | to let |1 her | know that |0 Yelp | may be a good tool for helping spreading the |1 word | about Papeluna ."
|0 I | ended up buying a birthday |1 card | and would probably come back for more .

Watch out for your wallet
Watch out for your wallet !
This |0 company | is overpriced for their services .
|0 They | pride |1 themselves | on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but |0 you | better believe |0 they | are going to mark |1 you | up on that feel good premise .
"On a recent event quote |1 that | |0 I | had done , |0 they | came in thousands of dollars over their local competition ."
The craziest |0 part | is that they are n't even based locally at the city |0 I | 'm in - |0 they | just have ' |1 teams | ' in areas through the country .
|0 I | 've spoken to vendors who are used by them |0 who | had |1 nothing | good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote |1 events | against them even though |0 they | openly admitted that |0 they | felt Canadian |0 Outback | was pricing their |1 entertainment | out of the market and doing |1 more | to hurt their |1 business | than help |1 them | .
Be warned - |0 they | 'll ltake |1 you | for everything |0 they | can .
Believe |1 me | .
|0 This | is THE premier university in Virginia .
|0 It | is also the largest .
"With a Pizza |0 Hut | , IHOP , 3 Starbucks , Chili s , Panera , and Chipotle on campus ALONE , |0 VCU | has |1 some | of the best eating options for students ."
"|0 VCU | has the # 1 art |1 school | in America , and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling ."
"The |0 Rams | , the VCU sports team , also made the |1 NCAA | Final 4 this year , too !"
"|0 VCU | also offers high - rise |1 living | for students and professors , and the historic yet fixed - up |0 houses | in the Fan are also available to students , professors , or even people wanting to live in a safe , viable community ."
"|0 VCU | is also minutes from Downtown Richmond , Canal Walk , Carytown , Stony Point , Short Pump , and the VCU Medical Center ."
|0 It | is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave |1 reviews | every year .
"The U of R is also recommended , too !"
|0 Orr | 's a nightmare !
DO N'T GO !
My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids |0 who | 'd arrived around 1:00 am and were drinking at the springs .
"When |0 we | complained to the management ( as we were instructed to do if there were any |0 problems | ) , |0 nothing | happened !"
"Then , the next morning , when |0 we | , among many other irate guests , asked to speak to the owner , |0 he | refused to do so ."
"Not only that , but |0 he | told |1 us | , via his manager , that it was our responsibility to get up a second |1 time | in the middle of the night and call the night |1 staff | if the |0 problem | continued , even though his |0 manager | did |1 nothing | the first time to stop the |1 kids | ."
"|0 Orr | is not relaxing , |0 it | 's not a safe space , and the |0 owner | is awful ."
"To add |1 insult | to injury , |0 he | refused to refund our |1 money | ."
Do n't go !
|0 FHS | is a good high school -- c / o 1998
|0 I | enjoyed my |1 time | at Franklin High School .
"|0 We | had relatively good |1 facilities | at the time -- decent science labs , with multiple hoods and access to good equipment ; nice gymnasiums , and a well - funded music department ( |0 I | was in the guitar ensemble ) ."
"Now , of course , there 's a new |0 building | , with presumably better facilities ."
All to the good .
"For those |0 who | care , a good |0 proportion | of the my class went on to 4 - year colleges , many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News ."
"If |0 I | remember , |0 students | went to Dartmouth , U. Penn , Duke , BU , William and Mary , Vassar , Howard , and Carnegie Mellon , among others ."
"Many |0 students | went to Rutgers , including their top - ranked pharmacy program ."
"The |0 point | is -- |0 FHS | gives |2 you | the |1 opportunity | to make |1 it | to a good college , but |0 you | need to work hard ."
Absolutely the best little motel on the coast !
"|0 I | 've stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and |0 I | have to say |0 it | 's one of the best lodging experiences |0 I | 've ever had on the coast ... and |0 I | 'm even comparing |1 it | to the big resorts |0 I | 've stayed at !"
"A large |0 group | of my friends and I rent almost the whole |1 motel | every year for a weekend , and the |0 experience | and stay have always been five - star ."
"The |0 rooms | are SO clean , the |0 managers | / owners are the nicest people , the |0 place | feels so homey , and the |0 location | and grounds are beautiful ."
"There 's a |0 restaurant | nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street ."
"The motel is very well maintained , and the |0 managers | are so accomodating , |0 it | 's kind of like visiting |1 family | each year ! ;-)"
|0 I | honestly ca n't rave enough about this place ... |0 it | 's really a hidden gem worth checking out !
My favorite cuban cafe in Orlando
"|0 I | have been eating |1 Cuban | for a long time , sandwiches mainly along with other dishes .."
"|0 I | love Cuban |1 coffee | , colada ... mmmm anyways |0 I | found this |1 place | and ca n't stop going there , |0 I | stop in at least once a week and anytime |0 I | 'm in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack ."
The |0 place | is chill and comfortable .
|0 They | do n't speak the best |1 English | but enough to get by .
"|0 They | bake |1 bread | fresh daily , |0 they | do n't press their |1 sandwiches | |0 which | is the way |0 I | like |1 it | , and the |0 meat | is always fresh ."
"|0 They | have a great lunch |1 special | with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains ."
And their |0 breakfast | is awesome !!
|0 I | can not describe how delicious the mango and cheese |0 pastries | and the |0 omelets | are to die for .
Stop in and have a |1 bite | |0 you | wo n't regret |1 it | .
A slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth !
highly recommended .
|0 I | have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend |1 it | to anyone .
"|0 I | 've read |1 some | of the reviews below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctor s office there is sometimes a |0 wait | ( depending on what other patients are being seen for ) and |0 some | of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly ( just like |0 they | would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if |0 you | do not have |1 insurance | ) ..."
|0 I | have seen |1 several | of the providers from the office and have not once been shown |1 anything | but care and consideration .
|0 I | ca nt speak for them but any |0 tests | or appointments |0 they | recommend are probably in the best interests of us ( the patient ) and |0 you | have the |1 ability | to decline |1 anything | |1 that | |0 they | suggest to you .
|0 I | personally have had wonderful |1 service | and if |0 you | re truely looking for a FAMILY practice ... Warner |0 Family | is the place for you .
Not |1 what | |0 i | expected !
|0 We | read the good |1 reviews | before going and had high |1 hopes | .. but to our dismay |0 it | did nt turn out that |1 way | !
"~ |0 It | took over 40 |1 mins | to be taken to our table , once there |0 it | took another 20 |1 mins | to get our |1 orders | and took a further 45 mins till our |0 starters | landed on our table ."
"Very frustrating for a restaurant |0 that | has 1 |1 rosette | and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no |0 canape's | or amuse to keep |1 us | occupied , once |0 we | complained about the wait |0 they | took |2 us | |1 something | to nibble on but |0 that | took |0 us | getting out our |1 chairs | and wondering round to do |1 that | and it was impossible to get anyone s |1 attention | ."
|0 Scallops | were overcooked and the foie |0 gras | was cold but the |0 rest | of the food was lovely .
On top of that though |0 they | tried to charge |2 us | service |1 charge | just to rub |1 it | it ....
Would n't go back as there are a |0 lot | of places A LOT better and cheaper .
"Nice selection , very clean , friendly staff !"
Hot |0 Iron | has become a favorite of our family .
|0 Everyone | can get the signature |1 dish | with ingredients and spices |1 that | |0 they | want and have the |1 fun | of watching |1 it | cook .
The |0 staff | are very friendly and conscientious .
"|0 They | always ask if |0 you | have |1 meat | in your dish , ( for vegetarians like me ) , |0 they | scrub an |1 area | of the grill and use separate |1 utensils | to cook ."
"|0 They | do n't just dump your |1 ingredients | on and cook either , but carefully separate |1 meat | to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the |1 veggies | from turning to mush ."
"The |0 selection | of meats , veggies and sauces is awesome too !"
Every time |0 we | go |0 they | seem to have a different |1 ingredient | or two |0 which | keeps |1 things | interesting .
"Meats are kept VERY cold , |0 seafood | smells fresh and the serving |0 bar | is VERY clean ."
"|0 Prices | are reasonable , ( Kid s |0 meals | are around 4.99 ) and Wednesday's |0 they | have discount dinner |1 prices | , |0 I | believe ."
"Great Cookies , Cakes , and Customer Service"
"|0 It | was my birthday and |0 I | had a last minute |1 idea | to have a bakery |1 cake | instead of one pre-made in a convenience store , but the |0 problem | was |0 it | was the day before Valentine s and when many |0 bakeries | turned |1 me | down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , |0 Fiona | stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful |1 cake | ."
"Not only did |0 it | taste wonderful , but the |0 texture | was unbelievable , the |0 frosting | was n't overly sweet to over power the |1 cake | , and the |0 cake | itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall ."
"Although |0 I | 'll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , |0 I | 'll gladly do |1 it | knowing that since she 's been astounding to me once before that |0 she | 'll always be that way !"
( Also |0 she | has a really great |1 website | !
"And |0 we | bought a few |1 cookies | there too , |0 they | were fantastic as well ! )"
|0 She | deserves many 5 star |1 reviews | !!
Food Craving Gone and Weight Loss at Acupuncture Doctor
|0 I | am a college student .
"Before treatment , my food |0 cravings | were "" out of control "" |0 which | caused |1 me | to be stressed out ."
|0 I | experienced a Definite |1 Decrease | in food craving ( about 50 % ) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
|0 I | actually loss 4 |1 pounds | after my 1st treatment and loss 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment .
|0 I | was amazed .
|0 I | am now more at peace and my food |0 craving | is about 99 % gone after only 3 treatments .
Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR |0 I | was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend 's |0 aunt | recommended |1 it | .
"|0 It | hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain ."
|0 What | |0 I | like most about Dr. Liau is that |0 she | is very caring .
|0 She | talks to you at each appointment .
|0 I | can tell |0 she | really cares and wants to help .
|0 I | am SO GLAD to have found |1 Dr. | Liau .
Now |0 I | feel more confident wearing my bathing |1 suit | in the summer .
An Asset to Richmond
"For a long time , one big |0 source | of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first - run multiplex ."
|0 Bowtie | has filled that |1 role | nicely .
"The |0 theatre | is in an old brick warehouse , |0 which | is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium ."
The |0 owners | of Bowtie manged to add |1 something | new while preserving |1 what | was already there .
The |0 theatre | has greatly improved the surrounding |1 neighborhood | .
"There 's |0 plenty | of parking , and |0 I | 've never had an |1 issue | with audience members |0 who | wo n't stop talking or answering their |1 cellphones | ."
"Best of all , there are no |0 ads | !!!! !"
Just previews and the main feature .
"Expect to pay full |1 price | , and the |0 theatres | themselves are on the small side ."
"But if |0 you | like going to the movies , |0 you | should love |1 Bowtie | ."
"The |0 mangers | also play a classic |1 movies | on Sundays , |0 you | can get a |1 beer | in the lobby , and repeat |0 customers | can get |1 discounts | if |0 they | have a member |1 card | ."
A great cinema in a great location .
"Thank |1 you | , |1 Bowtie | !"
Craft Wonderland with History
My first |0 visit | was so fun yesterday .
|0 I | could have stayed all day and not seen all the |1 things | .
|0 I | am doing origami |1 jewelry | and found exactly the right |1 things | for earrings and got many other |1 ideas | there too .
|0 I | bought a beginner s quilling |1 set | and like making the filigree |1 forms | |0 you | can make and add to other |1 crafts | .
"The |0 owner | , Jean , has been there 31 years !"
What a history .
"|0 She | is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor ."
|0 I | really enjoyed meeting |1 her | and happy to learn |0 she | comes from Oklahoma and has the |1 values | of a solid no bs country girl .
This |0 store | is a real gem and has |1 much | to offer the serious |1 crafter | or the occasional crafter .
"By the way , |0 Salmagundi | ( the store name ) means |1 something | like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mixed bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kinds of things ."
Great name for a great store !
Shop Local !

the 2010 |0 Genesis | is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
|0 I | am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
|0 I | have never seen this |1 car | before until this |0 lady | at wal mart had |1 it | and |0 she | told |1 me | |0 she | got |1 it | here and that |0 everyone | was so nice to her .
|0 I | asked |2 her | who |0 she | worked with and |0 she | just told |1 me | |0 ti | was the sales manager .
"|0 I | took the |1 weekend | off and came in and asked for the manager |0 who | is Jeff and |0 he | remembered |1 her | right away even remembered her |1 dog | , |0 I | was a bit shocked that |0 someone | would pay that close |1 attention | ."
"|0 We | got to talking and |0 he | got |1 me | set up and |0 I | test drove with Craig and |0 I | fell head over heels for this car |0 all | |0 I | kept saying , "" was |0 I | got ta have |1 it | ! """
|0 I | thouhgt |0 it | would be out of my price range but |0 they | really worked with me and now |0 I | could nt be happier .
|0 Jeff | and Craig are really good at what |0 they | do and know exactly how to treat a |1 customer | .
Definitely go see |1 them | !
"Bait and switch , untrained workers"
"Called the Bonanza |1 store | 2 weeks ago , before |0 I | ripped out 350 sq |1 ft | of ceramic tile ... was told |0 I | would need a "" dual head concrete |1 grinder | "" to remove |1 thinset | and make a nice "" finished "" |1 look | ( ready for concrete stain ) ."
"Was quoted |1 $ | 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc ."
"No problem , sounded like it 's done every day ."
Will look beautiful .
"Got the |1 tile | ripped out , call today , now all the sudden this |0 grinder | wo n't leave a finished |1 look | AND |0 it | 's $ 125 PLUS around $ 75 for the inserts ."
|0 I | can rent another |1 machine | for like $ 60 |0 that | will give |2 it | a finished |1 look | .
So from $ 55 to $ 260 ?
Are |0 they | serious ?
|0 I | feel like |0 they | did n't tell |2 me | the |1 pitfalls | before |0 I | pulled out this |1 tile | and now that |0 I | have no other |1 options | |0 they | want 5 TIMES the |1 price | ?
"Either these |0 people | do n't know |1 anything | about |1 what | |0 they | are renting , or worse - |0 they | are bait and switching ."
|0 One | suspects that earlier |0 reviewer | works for another laundry .
"Outside of |0 parking | being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry |0 Tub | is not filthy and |0 it | 's no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats |0 I | 've been in ."
"Yes , there are |0 bigger | , but |0 bigger | is n't necessarily better ."
"|0 I | availed |1 myself | of the wash 'n fold service , taking just about a year 's |1 worth | of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean |1 clothes | in clear plastic bags ( |0 I | 'd originally brought |1 them | in , in six large yellow garbage bags ) ."
The |0 cost | was certainly reasonable and |0 I | will continue my |1 patronage | of The Laundry Tub in the future .
Did n't hurt |1 any | that |0 they | knew my |1 name | by my second visit and greeted |1 me | warmly then and on my third visit .
"Whereas my |0 answer | to the question "" Where do |0 you | get your |1 laundry | done ? "" used to be , "" At the checkout line at WalMart , "" |0 I | can honestly say the |0 answer | now is , "" At The Laundry Tub . """
Thank |1 you | !
|0 I | recently took a rescue |1 puppy | to this Clinic and |0 I | was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated .
|0 They | worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved .
|0 We | have to leave |1 him | at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as |0 I | wished that no matter how many |1 times | |0 I | called |0 I | would not annoy |1 them | .
lol |0 They | where super friendly towards us and treated |1 us | like people not walking bags of cash .
"In this day it s rare to find such wonderful |1 people | |0 who | CARE , Not the kind of want to make |1 cash | ."
|0 I | would strongly suggest |0 you | give |2 them | the |1 chance | to prove to you that not all |0 people | in this world are evil !
|0 I | will never go to another vet as long as |0 I | have |1 animals | .
|0 I | live nearly two hours away and yet |0 I | will still make the |1 drive | to see |1 them | !
In fact |0 I | look forward to taking my |1 animals | to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated .
"Okay , here 's the |0 scoop | ."
|0 I | 'm a regular at the HH .
"The |0 food | is excellent , the |0 serivce | is horrible ."
|0 I | think |0 they | 're still in the mindset from when |0 it | was only smokers sitting around and drinking ... not in any hurry .
In my experience the |0 food | has been excellent ( for the most part ) .
"However , the |0 bartenders | / waitresses definately need to be re-trained ( if |0 they | ever had |1 any | to begin with ) and learn two |1 things | : only chat with customers when other |0 customers | are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if |0 people | are waiting ."
"In some cases the |0 result | is because of understaffing , in some cases the |0 staff | just does n't care / know better ."
"|0 They | must also get |1 something | to keep take - |1 out | warm , so |0 it | 's not room temperature at best when |0 you | get |1 it | home ."
|0 You | just have to know what |0 you | 're getting into when |0 you | go .
"Nice local pub , excellent food ( especially wings ) , and do n't go if |0 you | have a limited |1 amount | of time ."
Trust The Midas |1 Touch |
"|0 I | personally trust this Midas |1 store | with all my vehicles , |0 I | have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else !"
the |0 staff | is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there |1 money | .
|0 This | is however a very busy shop but there are |0 appointments | available & the |0 staff | up front will surely make sure |0 you | get back in a timely manner .
|0 I | look at some of these other comments & laugh because |0 people | think that the |0 world | revolves around them !
Like the girl with the fuse problem ...
|0 Midas | has the most high tech |1 equipment | in town & |0 I | guarantee |1 you | if |0 they | told |1 you | |0 it | was electrical then in deed |0 it | s electrical !
maybe |0 you | should understand how the |0 world | works & realize |0 you | are just like any other person & not put |1 yourself | on a pedestal .
|0 I | will continue going to Dave at Midas because |0 he | is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
When having your |0 car | worked on |0 you | have to trust the |1 mechanic | & this |0 Midas | is truly someone |0 you | can trust !
"|0 We | decided to try this |1 place | last night because |0 we | noticed that |0 it | had some interesting |1 things | on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop |1 sashimi | , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but |0 none | of these were particularly great or worth the sticker |1 price | ."
"Additionally |0 we | tried the Logan Circle |1 roll | , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ( $ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3.75 respectively ) ."
"The sweet potato tempura |0 roll | was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing |0 we | tried |0 that | |0 I | would say was well worth it and a great value ( and |0 I | never get vegetarian |1 rolls | ) ."
"The other |0 rolls | were n't at all special , especially given their |1 pricing | ."
The bottom |0 line | is that the |0 food | is n't great and is relatively high - priced .
"The |0 service | is solicitous , the |0 atmosphere | is nice and mod except the out - of - place flat - screen TV playing |1 football | ."
But |0 I | 'd go elsewhere unless the prices are cut .
|0 It | 's just not worth |1 it | .
Do n't Expect |1 Sleep | or Courtesy
I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007 .
"At 3:15 am on night # 2 , the fire |0 alarm | and strobe light activated in my room ."
|0 These | are not household type alarms .
"When |0 they | sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience ."
|0 I | called the front |1 desk | and got no |1 answer | .
"After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing |1 none | , |0 I | decided to just pack up and leave ."
"The desk |0 agent | actually argued with me , claiming that no such |0 alarm | had gone off ( as if |0 I | would make |1 that | up ? ) ."
"|0 He | finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room |0 alarms | had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ) ."
"This little |0 drip | offered no |1 apologies | whatsoever , and even refused to give |2 me | the |1 name | of the manager until |0 I | pressed |1 him | for it 3 times ."
"This |0 hotel | is adequate enough , but there is an obvious |0 problem | with the staff and management ."
Do not go there if |0 you | expect to sleep through the night .
"Poor Service , Lack of Passion : Do NOT go"
"|0 I | began seeing |1 Dr. | Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant |1 decline | in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services ."
"The poor |0 quality | starts at the receptionist desk , where the |0 staff | is very impatient and lack the |1 efficiency | |0 I | once loved about the office ."
"It took |2 them | nearly two |1 months | to complete a simple |1 task | , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that |0 it | 's a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ) ."
"Also , I was promised to have my test |1 results | emailed to me , but |0 it | never happened , and after a few attempts to get |1 Dr. | Romanick on the phone to brief |1 me | on my condition , |0 I | finally gave up and went to a different doctor ."
"Please do not go there if |0 it | 's professional , friendly , diligent medical services |0 you | 're looking for ."
"Save |2 yourself | the |1 trouble | , money and time and visit a more caring |1 facility | / doctor ."
"The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn , but advertised all over NY / NJ , including Fort Lee ."
When the |0 guys | arrived ( 2 hours later than agreed ) |0 they | told that |0 you | have to pay all the |1 tolls | |0 they | payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for |0 them | to drive back from your destination .
"|0 That | was not in agreement eather , but |0 they | realy demand |1 it | ."
And another $ 100 for wrapping the |1 furniture | .
So totalling |1 $ | 212 just for start before any |0 work | started .
"Guess |1 what | , was not in the initial agreement as well ."
|0 I | was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and |0 it | took for 3 strong guys 6 |1 hours | to load a |1 track | ( from 2 pm - 8 pm ) .
"The only reason |0 I | 'm giving 3 |1 stars | instead of 1 or 2 , |0 I | should admit , nothing was broken ."
So |0 I | still can recomend |1 them | but prepare pay twice as |1 much | as |0 they | tell |1 you | initially .
"One more thing , |0 they | do n't take any credit |1 cards | or checks ."
|0 You | have to pay |1 CASH | ONLY before |0 they | start unloading |1 track | on your destination .
Worst Apartments EVER
"|0 We | lived here for 2 years , the first |0 year | or so was okay ."
"Then , the more |1 power | |0 they | gave to Linda , the worse the |0 place | got ."
"|0 We | were always having our |0 water | shut off , there were always |0 people | having |1 parties | at the pool , even after |0 it | was supposed to be closed ."
"The |0 pool | was supposed to close at 10 and |0 they | would have |1 people | down there until 11:45 yelling , playing |1 music | and do |0 who | - knows - |1 what | in the dark corners of the pool ."
"Then , when |0 we | moved out , |0 we | cleaned the |1 apartment | top to bottom , |0 they | came back and tried to charge |1 us | for two cleaning fees ( and |0 we | never got our |1 deposit | back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , |0 we | have check |1 numbers | and records of this ) ."
"|0 Linda | is the rudest person |0 you | will ever talk to and |0 she | sticks up for all of the trashy , rude people |0 that | live there , not the nice ones |0 that | actually give a |1 crap | about respecting |1 others | ."
"Do not live here , |0 you | will regret |1 it | !"
The Worst Experience Ever !!!
"|0 I | have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and |0 it | started out as a decent experience ."
"He was referred to me by a friend , |0 who | did n't have the best |1 experience | with Ted , but said that |0 Ted | was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end ."
|0 I | figure |0 I | would give this |2 company | a |1 chance | .
"However , after giving a required $ 500.00 ( NON REFUNDABLE ) |1 deposit | before seeing any |1 plans | or ideas , |0 I | was sorry |0 I | did ."
"|0 We | met a couple of weeks later , |0 Ted | was late ."
"|0 He | brought fabric |1 books | , and pictures of furniture only , |0 which | all came way over budget ."
"By the time |0 we | got to the budget |0 i | told |2 him | |0 I | could work with , there was basically no |0 design | ."
Just curtains and a couple of accessories .
WHAT IS |0 THAT | ?????
This |0 company | is way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
Please |0 everyone | .... take |1 heed | and do n't get caught up in the hype about |0 DECOR | and YOU working with every budget ...
|0 This | is just a way for |0 them | to squirm their |1 way | into your precious pocket
Horrible .
Horrible .
"When |0 we | walked in , the |0 person | behind desk said : "" oh well , |0 you | must wait , |0 I | am in the middle of something . """
"After a good few minutes , |0 he | asked : "" |1 what | do |0 you | want ? """
Somewhere in between his rudeness |0 he | asked if |0 we | smoked .
|0 I | asked if this |0 hotel | had smoking |1 rooms | .
"|0 He | immediately said "" no , there is a $ 50 |0 deposit | now ! """
Sure enough |0 he | charged |1 it | to the credit card .
"When |0 I | inquired |0 he | rudely replied "" in the morning when things are checked out |0 you | 'll get |1 it | back . """
|0 I | called customer |1 service | about it because the |0 website | specifically states that there are no other |0 charges | at the check - in .
|0 I | also mentioned to the reception person .
"|0 He | responded "" |0 we | have |1 problem | with ' people ' "" ."
Imagine a |1 hotel | having |1 problems | with people .
|0 I | finally alerted |1 him | to his rudeness .
|0 He | said he 's had a long and bad day .
|0 We | had no |1 choice | but to stay but will take |1 this | as far as |0 we | can .
Do n't stay there .
|0 I | came to find out the |0 person | was the hotel OWNER also .
"My |0 friend | and I were to stay here for a girls night , catch up on our lives evening ."
|0 We | live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night .
Unfortunalty my |0 husband | and I had to put our 13 year old |1 lab | down that morning and |0 we | were not expecting |1 this | .
My |0 friend | called the |1 hotel | to cancel our |1 room | as soon as |0 I | called |1 her | .
|0 They | said that |0 we | were to be charged for this room regardless because |0 we | did not cancel within the 72 hours .
|0 I | called |1 them | back a few hours after putting my |1 Bodhi | down and |0 they | still would n't budge .
"|0 Times | are hard , |0 I | know , but |0 they | had no |1 compassion | ."
"|0 I | called 3 times to talked to a manager , never a call back ."
"|0 I | emailed 4 times , never a response ."
"In one of the emails |0 I | attached the |1 letter | from the Vet 's |0 that | expressed their |1 sympathy | , this |0 hotel | did |1 nothing | ."
|0 I | even emailed Mackinaw |1 Tourist | and nothing .
"|0 I | am sure |0 this | is a good place to stay from reading the other |1 reviews | , but if |0 something | unexpected happens in your life , |0 they | will not care ."
FANFUCKINGTASTIC
"Ok |0 I | am a New Yorker |0 who | has been going to school in Oxford , England ."
|0 I | thought the |0 UK | was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
"|0 I | thought to get a decent |1 pizza | the only |0 way | was at a fancy restaurant , and |0 I | have to get a whole |1 pie | ."
|0 I | thought |0 I | would have to wait until |0 I | went home to NYC .
Well then |0 I | went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around .
|0 I | saw this |1 place | and |0 it | looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
"|0 I | knew |0 I | had found the real |1 deal | , big pies , sold by the slice , with the |0 pizzas | sitting under the glass in the front ."
|0 They | have crushed red pepper |1 flakes | and oregano .
So |0 I | ordered a |1 slice | .
|0 It | tasted like |0 I | just flew back home .
"|0 I | du n no how |0 they | did |1 it | , but Scottish friends --- |0 this | is THE REAL DEAL ."
|0 I | congratulated this |1 establishment | for doing the |1 research | on making NYC |1 pizza | because these |0 Scots | fcking nailed |1 it | .
"That being said , |0 I | do n't know how their delivery |0 service | is ."
"|0 They | might want to change the |1 name | to reflect the new |1 yorkedness | of the pizza , scrummy |0 yummy | sounds gimmicky to me ."
"Good food , good wait staff , poor management"
|0 We | visited on 7/26/08 for dinner |0 We | received a gift |1 certificate | for the Mama Mia 's on Greenfield Ave .
"The |0 food | was good , and so was our |0 waitress | ."
"When it came |1 time | to pay the |1 bill | up front , |0 they | would not let |1 me | use |1 any | of the certificate for a tip ( |1 which | |0 I | have done with any other restaurant |0 I | 've gotten a gift |1 certificate | for . )"
|0 I | then asked if |0 I | could have |1 money | back in cash .
"The |0 person | went to go check with the manager , |0 who | was sitting at a table chatting with her friends |0 who | were eating there ."
Her |0 answer | was short and |0 manner | rather rude .
Sorry for interrupting |0 I | guess .
"The |0 cashier | was also short , unapologetic and made |1 me | feel as |0 I | was wasting her |1 time | ."
There were no other |0 options | available ( |0 I | only brought my check |1 card | to cover any overage |1 cost | ) and |0 she | rang |1 it | up and applied |1 it | to the gift card before telling |1 me | about the tip policy .
|0 I | will not be visiting Mama |1 Mia | 's again .
There are other |0 places | with food just as good with management |0 that | values |1 customers | and employees much more .
DINING AT TEXAS ROADHOUSE
"TEXAS |0 ROADHOUSE | HAS VERY GOOD |1 MEALS | , THAT THE |0 MEAT | COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES ."
|0 IT | HAS VERY GOOD |1 PRICES | .
ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING |0 AREA | IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS .
"ALSO , THERE SHOULD NOT BE |0 PEANUTS | ALL OVER THE FLOOR ."
"NEXT , THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE |0 PERSON | BRINGING |2 YOU | YOUR |1 FOOD | ."
|0 IT | S NOT A BIG DEAL BUT |0 I | HAD TO TAKE MY |1 SALAD | HOME BECAUSE |0 THEY | FORGOT TO BRING |1 IT | .
|0 I | HAD TO ASK THE |1 GIRL | |0 WHO | BROUGHT MY |1 FOOD | AND |0 SHE | NEVER CAME BACK TO LET |1 ME | KNOW .
|0 I | HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS .
"WHEN |0 YOU | FIRST COME IN THE |0 HOSTESS | IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY , THERE IS JUST A |0 BUNCH | OF WORKERS STANDING THERE ."
"|0 I | WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH , 2009 ."
"|0 I | WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008 , WHEN MY DAUGHTER S BUFFALO |0 WINGS | CAME OUT WITH A |0 FLY | ON IT ."
"THE |0 MANAGER | CAME OVER AND SAID |0 HE | WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW |1 BATCH | OF WINGS , |0 HE | SAID |0 WE | CA NT REALLY DO |1 ANYTHING | BECAUSE THE |0 DOORS | ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING ."
IN MY OPINION SHOULD OF JUST TOOK OFF THE |1 PRICE | OF THE WINGS FROM THE BILL .
BUT |0 EVERYONE | HAS THERE OWN |1 WAY | !!!!!!
Mezza Luna FTW !
their mezza |0 luna's | are deffly better than the pizza rolls .
"|0 it | s like a pizza roll , but |0 they | just toss |1 ham | and cheese inside ."
"it seems like |0 it | s healthier too , but |0 it | s prolly not ."
"also , |0 you | can call |1 em | ahead of time , and then go to pick up ur |1 food | , or have |1 it | delivered ** ."
"|0 that | cuts down on teh wait time , cus |0 u | can do other |1 stuff | while |0 u | r waiting ."
"it usually takes 20 |0 mins | for a mezza luna , as |0 they | have to add pure delicious |1 extract | to the mix ."
"their |0 pizza | was a little salty for me , but |0 it | s still good ."
|0 they | do that whole |1 thing | where |0 you | sandwich the |1 pepperoni | between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
"anyways , the mezza luna : |0 you | should try |1 it | ."
|0 it | runs |2 you | about 4 |1 bucks | and |0 it | deals crushing |1 blows | to hunger .
"** Edit : Living on campus at Clarkson University , |0 I | have had |0 food | delivered before ."
|0 This | was back between '05 and '09 and |0 I | do n't remember how many |1 times | |0 we | 've had |0 it | delivered .
"Perhaps |0 they | do n't deliver anymore , but the |0 deliciousness | of a mezza luna certainly warrants a |1 pickup | ."
"My 2004 x - |0 type | was getting close to 100,000 miles so |0 it | was time for an upgrade ."
|0 I | sent my |1 wife | and daughter over to check out a pre-owned 2009 |1 XF | .
|0 Michael | Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and |0 she | suggested |0 I | go check |1 it | out .
|0 I | went in later that afternoon and met with Michael .
|0 He | showed |2 me | the |1 car | |0 I | was interested in and |0 we | took a test |1 drive | .
|0 I | loved the |1 car | so |0 we | began negotiating my trade - |1 in | and the price of the 09 XF .
The entire |0 negotiation | took about 20 |1 minutes | .
Fair give and take on both sides until |0 we | agreed on a deal |0 that | was within my parameters and was fair to both sides .
10 minutes of paperwork and |0 I | was the owner of a beautiful pre-owned 09 XF .
"|0 I | have purchased over 15 |1 vehicles | ( cars , rvs , and boats ) in my lifetime and |0 I | have to say the |0 experience | with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best ."
"Friendly , knowledgeable , and above all fair ."
|0 That | 's all |0 you | can really ask from a car dealer and |0 Michael | and Barrett hit all |1 3 | .
Thanks for the great deal and the great car !
Identity Theft
Myself and my fiance 's identity was stolen from the office staff .
We were told by a detective and asked to check our |1 credit | for anything unusual .
Luckily |0 they | caught the |1 crooks | before |0 they | did |1 one | on us .
|0 It | was a black female |0 that | use to work in the office .
|0 She | stole the |1 information | and gave |1 it | to another guy |0 that | did all the |1 work | .
The other guy was pulled over one day and a |0 cop | saw suspicious |1 papers | with names and social security numbers on it .
|0 That | s how they were caught .
|0 They | both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
The |0 apartment | across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers .
|0 Nobody | lived there .
"A |0 girl | would show up , then a |0 guy | in a nice car would show up ."
"Short time later the |0 guy | would leave , then the girl leave ."
My |0 apartment | was usually quiet .
|0 I | lived in one |0 that | did not face the parking |1 lot | .
Parking |0 spaces | are just big enough for a Mini Cooper .
It sucked having an |1 SUV | .
"If |0 I | found a |1 spot | , |0 I | could nt fit in it ."
|0 Gates | worked 30 |1 % | of the time at best .
"|0 Bugs | were a small problem , nothing too bad ."
The best there is in service .
|0 I | was recently traveling down I - 24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a |1 blowout | on the southeast side of Murfreesboro .
"|0 It | was 4:50 when a |0 friend | told |1 me | to call |1 Bud | , |0 he | would take |1 care | of me ."
"Not only did |0 they | answer the |1 phone | at 4:50 on a Thursday , |0 they | hit the |1 ground | moving !."
"|0 They | tracked down the only |1 tire | |0 that | fit my BMW |1 330i | in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured |1 it | , then |0 they | came out , took off my |1 tire | ( |0 it | was a runflat - but |0 runflats | do n't do |2 you | any |1 good | if |0 they | blow out ) , and brought |1 it | to their shop to change the |1 tire | ."
|0 They | were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro |0 we | were and had |1 us | on our way by 6:30 that evening .
Thanks Bud for all of your help and taking |1 time | away from your family that evening .
"|0 It | 's without a doubt , the best service experience |0 I | 've ever had and just to be clear , the |0 price | |0 he | charged |1 me | was the same as my tire guy in Nashville 's price for putting on the other rear |1 tire | ."
|0 I | hope |0 I | can return the |1 favor | in the future !

Room ok .
|0 Service | and Client base not ok .
"|0 I | have stayed in this hotel many times , and while |0 it | typically offers a decent |1 bang | for the buck , its client |0 base | largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local , not so pleasant hood ."
"|0 I | have never considered |1 this | a real problem as |0 I | travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when |0 I | had to listen to a ( non-violent ) domestic fight |0 that | lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and |0 I | found out that the front |0 desk | was unmanned during night hours , my |0 choice | was to either waste tax payers |1 money | by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it ."
"|0 I | chose the |1 later | , but approached the front |1 desk | about the hotel policy to push over their |1 responsibilities | on local authorities , not to mention the good night s sleep |0 i | paid for but did nt get ."
I was told |0 management | would call |1 me | back but still waiting for that call .
"|0 I | will probably stay here again because |0 it | s cheap and |0 I | ca nt afford a better |1 hotel | , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this |1 hotel | for families or single female travellers ."
Was there this past weekend and the |0 guy | behind the counter yelled at me and my son because |0 we | believed |0 he | left the grandma |1 slice | in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the |0 slice | tasted more like a cracker .
"|0 He | preceded to grab the |1 slice | off the countertop and throw |1 it | into the trash while yelling at me saying , "" |0 you | do not order |1 what | |0 you | do not know about "" and "" |0 you | do n't know how pizza is made "" ."
It was very upsetting to see this |1 kind | of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
"|0 He | was in the process of making |2 me | a |1 pie | and when |0 I | got home , the |0 pie | was the worst |0 I | have ever seen ."
"|0 Cheese | was falling off , so oily and greasy ."
"|0 I | think |0 he | did |1 it | on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma |0 that | was n't so well - done ( actually , burnt ) ."
|0 I | will never go back to this place and |0 I | am reporting |1 them | to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my |1 pizza | and taking my |1 $ | 25 .
THIS |0 STORY | IS 100 % TRUE .
That little |0 man | |0 who | thinks |0 he | invented |1 pizza | can kiss my |1 *ss | .
"Long Lines , Silly Rules , Rude Staff , Ok Food"
The first |0 thing | |0 you | notice when |0 you | arrive on location is that the waiting |0 line | literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot .
"A |0 restaurant | with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order |1 tacos | must be good , right ?"
"|0 I | mean , |0 that | 's the way |0 it | works at amusement parks : the longest |0 lines | are at the best rides ."
"Well , |0 this | may be an exception ."
"The |0 staff | taking your |1 order | and "" waiting "" on you are very indifferent and have no |1 sense | of costumer service at all ."
|0 I | have gotten better |1 results | talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks .
"And do n't even think about asking to speak to the manager because this |0 guy | is , and pardon my |1 French | , a jerk ."
"If |0 you | have gotten through ordering , dealing with the rude staff and if |0 you | followed the dumb |1 rules | , you are finally presented with what |0 you | came for .. some tacos |0 that | are "" ok , "" but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle ."
Save |2 yourself | the |1 trouble | and skip this |1 place | all together .
|0 I | suggest |0 you | go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac .
Wish |0 this | was in Saratoga --
"We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler - professional diner |0 who | happens to own the Adelphi |1 Hotel | and travels the |1 world | -- and residing in Paris , London , New York the rest of the year ."
|0 SHE | KNOWS GREAT |1 FOOD | AND DINING EXPERIENCES .
|0 She | was dead on -- this |0 restaurant | was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
|0 I | can tell |1 you | we were pleasantly surprised -- |0 BT | has taste |1 memory | and each time back the |0 food | was consistently delicious -- same |0 dishes | -- were consistent .
Our |0 friend | is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining |1 experiences | and inspired food .
This |0 chef | knows |1 what | |0 he | is doing .
Treat |1 yourself | and go -- |0 you | will go back !
|0 I | am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this |0 restaurant | was in our town !
The affordable |0 rent | makes it possible for an inspired |0 chef | to serve his high quality |1 fare | at affordable prices !
Unlike Saratoga .
|0 I | rrly seek the |1 cehf | out to introduce |1 myself | -- but the second time |0 we | went -- |0 i | made a |1 point | of asking our wait |1 person | to introduce my |1 friend | and myself to the chef to tell |1 him | just how good our |0 meals | were .
Can not wait to go gain .
- R. Morris .
|0 I | think that |0 the | re pretty good .
"First of all , if |0 you | call for an appointment |0 they | wo n't tell |2 you | to call back a month later so |0 you | can then make |1 one | ."
"|0 They | also do n't tell |1 you | that |0 they | 're going to mail |2 you | an "" |1 application | "" to be admitted to be a patient ."
|0 I | feel that the |0 way | some doctor s |0 offices | work around here is a little bit absurd so |0 I | 'm happy that these |0 guys | do n't do those two |1 things | in particlular .
Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week .
The |0 doctor | did tell |2 me | that my male pattern |0 baldness | is due to my mother s father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but |0 that | 's a common misconception ( http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm ) .
In general |0 I | would say that the |0 staff | is attentive and nice .
But then again |0 I | was nice to them so |0 that | could have been why .
"Anyhow , after reading |1 some | of the other reviews it seems like |0 some | of the other reviewers are expecting |1 mircles | ."
If |0 you | want |1 miracles | |0 you | 'll have to go to 21st St .
|0 It | 's a pretty typical primary care office but for the area |0 it | 's very good .
|0 They | do n't do certain |1 things | |0 that | are really annoying about other offices .
First trip to Canada
|0 I | recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent |1 experience | .
|0 I | work for a large retail company recently expanding our |1 operations | into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time .
|0 This | can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing |1 boarders | for the first time .
|0 I | was very pleased to find my |1 accommodations | and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
"|0 I | found the |1 hotel | to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises ."
From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out |0 I | found the |1 staff | and facility to exceed my |1 expectation | .
|0 I | completely enjoyed my whole check in |1 experience | and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
|0 I | will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this |0 experience | will be helpful in my choice of hotels and |0 Novotel | will be my first selection .
Yes the |0 parking | can be a challenge but being from NJ |0 I | am no stranger to tight corners .
Please pass my |1 appreciation | to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as |0 it | helped make a stressful |1 trip | enjoyable .
Favorite place in Tampa .
Update : |0 I | had to add to my review .
|0 I | was just in last night and had a |1 chance | to dine in their new dining room .
AMAZING !
|0 I | frequent this |1 resturant | on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
"Well |0 I | was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter |0 who | asked if my |0 wife | and I would like to sit in their "" new "" dining room ."
Right away |0 they | told |1 us | that |0 it | was the same great food with the same prices so off |0 we | went .
We were greeted again and sat promptly .
"After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu |1 items | |0 they | had , |0 we | knew |0 we | were in for a treat !"
|0 I | had the Chicken Parmesan |1 Dinner | and my |0 wife | had the Shrimp Scampi |1 Dinner | .
AMAZING !
The |0 portions | were generous enough that |0 we | even took |1 some | home !
|0 I | have to say the |0 value | of this place always amazes |1 me | .
"It 's nice to see that even in the economy |0 we | can eat a |1 place | |0 that | has upscale |1 service | , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the |1 bank | while enjoying |1 it | !"
Bottom |0 line | is that when |0 it | 's a small privatly owned resturant like |0 this | is |0 you | can tell that the |0 owners | and employees take |1 pride | in their product and service .
Well Done !
Great work and honest establishment !
"|0 I | typically have |1 work | done on my Jeep at the dealership , but |0 it | is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership |1 prices | just did n't seem cost effective anymore ."
|0 I | had tried out few |1 place | around the area and had been ripped off a few times .
|0 I | had hear great |1 things | about Phet and G&G Automotive so |0 I | decided to give |2 him | a |1 try | .
The |0 service | was excellent and personable .
|0 He | checked out |1 what | |0 I | needed to have done told |1 me | |0 what | needed be fixed before |0 he | did any |1 work | and did great repair |1 work | .
"The |0 price | was actually lower than what |0 I | had anticipated and used to compared to other places , plus |0 he | showed |2 me | the |1 work | |0 he | did when |0 I | came in to pick up the |1 car | ."
"Also , a week after the work , |0 Phet | called |1 me | up to see how my |0 car | was running and to let |1 me | know that |0 they | had accidentally overcharged |1 me | for part of the work and wanted to give |2 me | a |1 refund | for that amount ."
|0 That | is just unheard of these days !
"|0 I | grew up in a small town where |0 you | knew and trusted your |1 mechanic | and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since |0 I | moved here , but |0 Phet | has shown that there really are honest hard working |0 mechanics | around ."
|0 He | is my mechanic going forward !
"Our |0 company | is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company , thus |0 we | are certainly a niche market ."
"|0 We | had been evaluating SEO |1 providers | for quite some time and finally decided to take the |1 plunge | with Stuart , and Ulistic ."
|0 We | made the |1 decision | for a couple of reasons .
1 . Social Media .
"|0 We | were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new |1 nothing | about Social Media - |0 we | just heard that |0 it | was the next big thing ."
2 . |0 We | really liked the |1 fact | that |0 Stuart | sets defined |1 objectives | and |0 we | meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
How has |0 it | gone so far ?
"Well |0 we | have been working with Ulistic for 1.5 months , and have 100 |1 people | following our |1 site | on Facebook , and our web |0 site | , www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold |1 increase | in traffic , |0 which | is significantly beating our |1 expectations | - |0 SEO | is a process |0 that | takes |1 time | and to get |1 results | this quickly is exceptional ."
"|0 We | are absolutely confident that Stuart 's ethical and focused |0 strategies | will see these |0 trends | continue to grow , and our |0 business | will reap the |1 rewards | of this program ."
"Finally , it must be said that |0 Stuart | is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because |0 he | is a genuinely good person and a great communicator ."
Excellent service and quality
|0 I | had Hom - |0 Excel | replace |1 most | of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago .
"The excellent |0 windows | have performed without any problems , but |0 that | 's not why |0 I | 'm writing my |1 review | ."
"Three weeks ago , |0 burglars | tried to gain |1 entry | into the rear of my home ."
The |0 intruders | slit the |1 screen | of the window .
"Next , |0 they | tried to force the |1 window | with a pry bar and then to break the |1 window | with a hammer ."
The |0 window | did n't break !
"My next - door |0 neighbor | heard the |1 noise | and turned on a |1 light | , thankfully scaring the two |1 miscreants | away ( |0 they | even left their |1 hammer | behind ! ) ."
"|0 I | called Home - |1 Excel | the next day to order a replacement |1 screen | for the window , and was happily surprised when |0 they | said that |0 they | were n't even going to charge |1 me | for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee ."
"Lo and behold , |0 they | replaced the |1 screen | ( |0 which | had to be ordered ) yesterday and did n't charge |2 me | a |1 dime | ."
Their |0 worker | even cleaned |1 3 | of my windows and changed a |1 lightbulb | for me .
"In this day and age , it is so rare to find a |1 company | with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies ."
"|0 I | rarely write |1 reviews | such as this one , but |0 they | certainly deserve anyone 's |1 business | !"
"Friendly staff , but definitely some problems"
"May , 2009 ."
We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guests .
"Got put into the wrong room the first night , and were quite surprised to have |1 someone | with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1:00 am !"
"Next day got moved into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guests ."
"There were 3 |0 adults | in our room but towels for only 2 , no linens for sofa bed ."
In the second room it took 3 |1 tries | to get all the |1 towels | and linens |0 we | requested .
A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room .
"They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes ."
"|0 Security | in the hotel seemed to be excellent , but we were never given an |1 explanation | as to why |0 someone | would open these |1 items | ."
"A mid-afternoon "" fire |0 drill | "" was disruptive , putting |1 everyone | out of the hotel ."
"When |0 we | called the front |1 desk | about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel |2 staff | quite a |1 while | to quiet |1 them | down ."
"The |0 staff | was friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seemed to want to help , but too many unusual |0 things | happened to make |1 us | want to stay there again ."
Be Careful Of Who Your Sales |0 Guy | Is
|0 I | think this |0 place | is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
My |0 experience | was awful though .
|0 It | ALL had to do with the sales guy |0 which | was a young 22 year old |0 who | had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
"|0 I | was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought |1 it | , but the sales |0 guy | |0 I | dealt with ruined the |1 deal | ."
"Essentially , |0 I | told |1 him | |0 I | did n't trust |1 him | cause |0 he | was a car salesman , but |0 he | got so incredibly offended at that statement that |0 he | had to go cry to another salesman and compose |1 himself | before coming back ."
"|0 I | do n't know if the |0 kid | had a bad day or what , but |0 I | had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until |0 he | dropped the |1 issue | ."
"After that , |0 I | just tried to ignore his |1 lack | of professionalism and test drive the |1 car | ."
|0 I | played dumb and asked |2 him | |1 questions | |1 that | |0 I | already knew the |1 answers | to and |0 he | responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
"For instance |0 I | asked |0 who | owned |1 Mazda | and |0 he | said with confidence |0 that | was GM , |0 which | is n't true ."
"|0 I | mean , |0 I | do n't care if |0 he | does n't know , but if |0 he | pretends to know and tells |2 me | |1 BS | to my face , there 's no |0 way | |0 I | 'm going to trust |1 him | when |0 matters | turn to the price of the car and financing ."
The Worst Chinese |0 I | 've Ever Had
|0 This | is by far the worst chinese food |0 I | have ever had .
The |0 service | stunk .
"|0 I | called in my |1 order | and upon arriving to pick |1 it | up , |0 they | got my |1 order | confused with someone else s ."
|0 They | helped about three other |1 people | before |0 they | offered to help |1 me | again .
|0 They | also got my friend s |1 order | mixed up and wanted to charger |2 her | $ 10 |1 more | than what |0 she | had wanted .
|0 She | asked for the dinner combo and |0 they | gave |2 her | two dinner |1 plates | instead .
|0 We | were standing in the store for 20 minutes to simply pick up an |1 order | .
Not to mention that the wait |0 staff | was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull .
|0 They | were abrasive and rude - when |0 they | were the ones |0 who | messed |1 everything | up .
|0 We | had to throw out about 80 |1 percent | of our meals because the |0 food | tasted so horrible .
"|0 I | do nt know how it is possible to make orange |1 chicken | , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China |0 Delight | accomplished |1 that | ."
The only |0 thing | |0 that | was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo |0 mein | was barely tolerable .
|0 I | will NEVER go here again .
Lucky |0 Panda | in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal .
|0 I | have no |1 idea | how China |0 Delight | won number 1 Chinese |1 restaurant | in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
Terrible Service
One of the worst experiences |0 I | 've ever had with a auto repair shop .
|0 We | took our |1 vehicle | in for a repair to the air conditioning .
"Approx 4 months later , the |0 compressor | went out ."
"|0 We | took |1 it | back in to have |1 it | repaired again , and less than a week later the second |0 compressor | went out ."
"|0 We | went in for a third visit and |0 they | fixed |1 it | again , but this time when |0 we | picked up the |1 car | , the |0 radio | and clock did not work ."
"So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks , |0 we | brought the |1 car | back again ."
"When |0 we | expressed our |1 discontent | to the manager ( |0 that | 's right , the manager ) , did |0 he | say |0 he | would return some |1 money | , did |0 he | say |0 he | would give a |1 discount | on our next visit , did |0 he | just say "" |0 I | 'm sorry "" ."
"Nope , none of the above ."
|0 He | stood there and told |1 us | how |0 he | was n't at fault .
"|0 It | was the fault of the parts supplier , and can |0 we | imagine how |0 he | felt having to put another 2 |1 hours | of work in the car ."
And |1 what | did |0 we | expect ... that |0 he | bench test every |1 part | .
"At no time during the conversation did the |0 words | , "" |0 I | 'm sorry "" ever come out of his mouth ."
"|0 I | , nor anyone else in my family , will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again ."
"Well , unless of course the third |0 compressor | |0 he | put in the car goes out ."
Do not use this |1 company | !
|0 I | dropped off a sheet metal |1 piece | |1 that | |0 I | needed copied due to th |0 it | was needing to be replaced .
|0 I | asked if |0 they | could copy the |1 piece | |0 I | dropped off .
|0 They | said it would be made exactly like the one |0 I | needed to replace .
|0 I | picked |1 it | up when |0 it | was finished and was charge |1 30.00 | .
When |0 I | got to the job and tried to insert the new |1 piece | of metal |0 IT | WOULD NOT FIT !!
|0 I | took the original |1 piece | of metal and rigged |1 it | to make due since |0 I | had to complete the |1 job | .
|0 I | took the |1 receipt | and the metal |0 that | did not fit and asked |1 Pomper | for my money back .
The |0 girl | at the desk was sooo rude |0 I | could not believe |1 it | !
|0 She | told |1 me | |0 she | could not use the |1 piece | |0 I | was returning and the |0 company | would only put |1 it | in the trash so |0 I | could not return |1 it | .
|0 I | explained |0 I | did not get |1 what | |0 I | paid for .
|0 She | asked |1 me | to bring the original |1 piece | back and |0 I | told |2 her | |0 I | had to use |1 it | on the job .
|0 She | told |1 me | |0 that | was to bad |0 she | would do |1 nothing | to help |1 me | since |0 she | could not use or resell the |1 piece | .
|0 I | said |0 I | was going to trash |1 it | also and could |0 I | at least have a |1 credit | .
With a smirk on her face |0 she | told |1 me | NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and |0 THAT | IS THE WAY |0 IT | WAS .
DO NOT USE THIS |1 COMPANY | .
There are to many |0 people | |0 that | need our |1 business | to have to put up with this unfair treatment !!!!!
|0 I | would NEVER recommend this |1 gym | to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner 's own unprofessionalism .
When |0 I | originally joined in January |0 I | only did so because I was told |0 I | would be able to cancel the 12 month |1 membership | if |0 I | was to move away .
|0 I | signed up with one of the staff |0 who | was very pleasant and professional .
Actually working out there was good - the |0 machines | are nice and the |0 classes | are fun .
The locker |0 room | is certainly lacking - |0 I | would never shower or change there .
|0 They | need to update the locker |1 rooms | ASAP .
Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my |1 membership | as I was told |0 I | could do since |0 I | was moving away .
"The |0 owner | was VERY rude , accused |1 me | of not reading my |1 contract | , and basically told |1 me | to shut up when |0 I | was trying to ask |1 questions | to further understand the |1 process | of canceling my |1 membership | ."
|0 I | was able to cancel |1 it | but only after paying a $ 50 |1 fee | ( |1 which | the staff |0 person | |0 who | signed |1 me | up stated |0 I | would not have to pay if |0 I | had |1 proof | of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
|0 I | would understand if I was being treated this |1 way | by a staff member but the club 's actual OWNER ?!
Bad for business .
|0 I | was appalled .
|0 I | will never recommend this |1 gym | to any woman .
The |0 equipment | and classes are n't good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff !!!
There are better |0 places | on the Cape - FITNESS 500 !
The Salon Experience from Hell
|0 I | feel obligated to share this |1 story | .
Right out of college |0 I | called the |1 salon | and explained my |1 situation | .
"Just graduated , just moved , not rich , and starting new |1 job | soon ."
"|0 I | never got a price |1 quote | over the phone and |0 they | take your cc |1 info | just to make the |1 appointment | because if |0 you | do n't show up , |0 they | 'll charge |1 you | ."
|0 I | had this ridiculous celebrity |1 stylist | from LA named Derrick .
"After |0 he | already put |1 product | on my hair |0 he | said "" |0 I | should warn |1 you | , |0 I | 'm expensive . """
"|1 What | was |0 I | supposed to do , say |0 I | ca n't afford |1 you | and walk out with crap all over my hair ."
|0 I | wanted to be very blonde and instead |0 he | pulled my root |1 color | throughout my whole hair |0 which | is a gross mousey brown .
"The other |0 stylists | around me kept pressuring |1 me | saying |0 he | 's so wonderful , |0 you | 're going to love your |1 hair | ."
$ 400 later my |0 jaw | dropped when the |0 receptionist | told |2 me | the |1 total | .
"|0 Derrick | did a terrible |1 job | , was a complete jerk the entire time , and |0 I | had no |1 warning | as to the price ."
|0 I | cried the entire way home .
"|0 He | then "" fixed "" |1 it | for free but |0 it | still looked like crap ."
|0 I | will never go back .
|0 It | was the salon experience from absolutely Hell .
|0 He | also told |1 me | that |0 he | worked on the cast of will and grace and that |0 they | were all jerks .
|0 That | 's my favorite show of all time .
|0 I | 'm pretty sure for the cast that |0 it | was the other way around .
Maybe |0 he | did n't do a good |1 job | and |0 they | told |1 him | so .
Absolute Nightmare !
STAY AWAY !
Very unhappy ...
"Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA , so |0 I | did not know |1 what | to expect ."
|0 That | said - |0 he | seemed to be doing well enough .
"However , then |0 I | asked to amend my |1 return | to apply a |1 credit | |0 I | had just become eligible for ."
"|0 I | expected to pay for this service , but imagine my |1 surprise | when |0 I | received a |1 bill | for MORE than |1 what | |0 I | paid to have the original |1 return | prepared ."
"Asked why , |0 Rod | simply told |1 me | that |0 he | had to research how to do the |1 amendment | ( |0 it | was an amended to show that |0 I | had purchased a |1 home | - nothing out of the ordinary , |0 one | would think ) and |0 that | took |1 time | to figure out ."
"Well , |0 that | was strike one ."
"|0 I | was n't going to use |1 them | again , but |0 I | was going to leave |1 it | at that ."
"However , now that |0 I | have come to realize that |0 I | am going to owe the |2 IRS | |1 $ | 6,000 + despite doing exactly |1 what | |0 Rod | told |1 me | to do , |0 I | feel |0 I | have to voice my |1 opinion | ."
"Last year , after all was said and done , |0 I | asked |1 Rod | whether my payment |0 structure | would leave |1 me | with no / little tax liability at the end of the year ."
|0 He | said yes .
"Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6,000 + , all due on April 15 , 2010 and |0 all | |1 that | |0 Rod | has to say to the matter is ' well , |0 you | wo n't have to pay a |1 penalty | . '"
"|0 I | may not have to pay a |1 penalty | , yet , but |0 this | is NOT what |0 I | had in mind when hired these |1 guys | ."
"In the words of my new accountant , |0 THEY | LET |1 ME | DOWN !"
"Bit sketchy , sporadic delivery times"
|0 I | bought about |1 half | of the furniture |0 I | own from this place .
Why ?
Because |0 they | cut |2 me | good |1 deals | if |0 I | paid in cash .
"Sketchy , right ?"
Well |0 they | came through and delivered almost |1 all | of my items within a few days .
( |0 They | even got |2 me | a |1 couch | pretty quickly . )
"The |0 guy | |0 who | was cutting |2 me | the |1 deals | and getting |2 me | the |1 furniture | quickly , Ahmed , was nice and mostly professional , except the semi-sketchiness ."
"Then one day , |0 Ahmed | left the |1 country | , not to return for months , WITHOUT informing |1 me | ."
|0 He | also neglected to tell the other |1 person | working at the store about a dining room table |1 that | |0 I | had ordered and |0 that | was supposed to be coming in .
The other |0 person | working at the store did n't know that |0 I | still had this |1 table | coming .
"|0 I | had paid in cash , and |0 he | said |0 he | had no |1 receipt | / record of my purchase ."
"|0 I | came back with the receipt |0 Ahmed | had provided upon my purchase , and the |0 guy | took forever to copy |1 it | but said that |0 he | would take |1 care | of the situation ."
|0 I | waited .
And waited .
|0 He | never once contacted |1 us | .
|0 I | 've had to pester this new |1 guy | several times to ask when my |0 table | will arrive .
|0 He | kept saying different arrival / delivery |1 dates | and did n't seem terribly apologetic .
"|0 It | has been 3 weeks and |0 I | STILL do n't have my |1 table | ( |0 which | was NOT cheap , |0 I | might add ) ."
"|0 Point | is : |0 You | might be able to get a good |1 deal | on some nice furniture -- |1 which | |0 I | did -- but |0 they | 're not very communicative and |0 god | forbid |0 something | goes wrong , |0 you | 'll have to fight to get |1 it | resolved ."
Poor Service
Run do n't walk .
My |0 experience | with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger .
If |0 I | could give |2 them | a lower |1 rating | than poor |0 I | would .
"On August 21st , 2009 |0 I | ordered |1 furniture | from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for |0 HDS | to deliver |1 it | ."
After seventeen days the delivery |0 van | showed up at my home minus two pieces .
I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered .
No |0 one | will give |2 me | a |1 date | .
"|0 I | spent |1 $ | 2300 on the bedroom suite , |0 which | was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor ."
Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a |0 piece | of wood was broke on the headboard ; the |0 chest | of drawers was missing all four |1 pieces | necessary to attach the |1 legs | ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the |1 dresser | to lean into the wall ; and a |0 nighstand | was missing a |1 drawer | .
How do |0 you | lose a |1 drawer | .
"After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings , Boyles , the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the |0 latter | finally called |1 me | back and said |0 they | would be up to pick the |1 dresser | and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned ."
The customer |0 service | at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up |1 furniture | .
So |0 I | am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite .
|0 I | hope the |0 owners | and employees of this store have broken bedroom |1 suites | in their homes and furniture sitting in someone 's warehouse .
Maybe then |0 they | will begin to understand poor customer |1 service | and terrible sit up service .
Excellent Driving School
I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then |0 I | 've been a nervous wreck and have n't been behind the wheel .
"Unfortunately , a family |0 emergency | required |1 me | to conquer this |1 fear | ."
A very good |0 friend | of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving |1 School | and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry .
"|0 She | highly recommended |1 him | and described |1 him | as the "" Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving |1 instructions | "" ."
|0 I | called the |1 school | most probably 10 times before |0 I | finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
|0 I | had to cancel my initial |1 lesson | 4 times and on the 5th attempt the |0 management | was quick enough to associate my |1 cancellations | with my fear and finally encouraged |1 me | into taking my initial |1 lesson | .
"Five minutes before my initial lesson , |0 I | got a |1 call | from Gerry advising |1 me | of his arrival and to come down as soon as |0 I | was ready ."
My |0 heart | pounded as |0 I | walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing |1 Gerry | in an SUV - Lexus !
|0 I | thought of canceling the |1 lesson | once again because |0 I | did n't feel comfortable driving an |1 SUV | .
"|0 Gerry | pleasantly said "" since |0 I | am already here why do n't |0 we | give |2 it | |1 shot | ."
|0 I | trust |1 you | and believe that |0 you | 'll be able to handle |1 this | and |0 all | |0 you | have to do is to reciprocate !
Trust |1 me | and most especially trust and believe in |1 yourself | .
"Do n't worry , |0 I | 'll take |1 care | of you ! """
....... the |0 rest | was history !
Here |0 I | am now driving confidently on my own .
"Gerry , |0 I | ca n't thank |1 you | enough for helping |1 me | cope with my fear ."
"To my friend , thank |1 you | for your recommendation ... |0 you | were true to your words in saying |0 Gerry | is a "" Saintly Instructor ... Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is !"
Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant
My |0 family | and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost |1 all | of the Chinese Restaurants because |0 we | love Chinese |1 food | .
Well it took |2 us | a |1 while | to find |1 one | |1 that | |0 we | liked .
But |0 we | do n't just like |1 House | of Joy |0 WE | LOVE |1 IT | .
|0 Everything | |0 we | have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area |0 we | have been to -- and trust |1 me | |0 we | have been to a lot of them .
|0 We | just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when |0 we | had to visit the Bexar County Tax |1 Office | off of Bandera Road .
|0 We | stopped in and got some take |1 out | and can not stop going back .
|0 They | have the best Egg Drop |1 Soup | |0 I | have ever tasted .
|0 We | also love their Egg |1 Rolls | and Spring Rolls .
And every |0 entree | |0 we | have ordered is perfect .
Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh .
Their |0 prices | are extremely reasonable for the amount of food |0 you | receive .
The |0 staff | is also just so pleasant to deal with .
|0 They | are also quick at getting your |1 order | out to you .
|0 You | do n't have to sit and wait around forever like most places !!
So |0 anyone | looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try |1 it | because |0 I | promise |2 you | 2 |1 things | --- |0 You | wo n't regret |1 it | !!
and |0 you | will go back for more !!!

"PS |0 I | have noticed on here that |0 someone | left a |1 comment | that "" |0 all | of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends "" and |0 I | will tell |1 you | that |0 I | do n't know these |1 people | except from eating at their restaurant ."
|0 We | are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago .
So that |0 comment | is completely false .
Because |0 we | think |0 IT | 'S THE BEST !!!
and |0 we | do n't know |1 them | except for eating there .
|0 Dr. | Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
"|0 I | am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but |0 i | do know from personal experience that |0 Dr. | Christopher T. Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!"
|0 He | was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic |1 valve | due to critical aortic stenosis .
"|0 I | had a surgery |1 date | of July 17 , 2008 ."
"Then |0 he | renigged when |0 he | read my Health Care |1 Proxy | , even though |0 i | agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as |0 he | had twice stated |0 i | must agree to ) ."
"|0 He | later said that by 2 months |0 he | "" meant at least two months "" ."
Two |0 months | and at least two months are totally different things .
"|0 He | did not even give |2 me | the |1 chance | to say |0 i | would stay on the ventilator longer , |1 which | |0 i | would have ."
A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed .
|0 He | also never even said |0 he | was sorry .
Just said |0 i | was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room .
"So , therefore , now |0 he | says |0 i | am inoperable ( even though |0 i | am not 100 % inoperable ) , and |0 he | is letting |1 me | die ."
"|0 I | am just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor |0 i | have no other |1 alternatives | ."
"|0 I | , along with my friends , consider this |1 doctor | to be the cause of my death as |0 he | is not even trying to save my |1 life | by operating ."
"Even my |0 PA | |0 i | went to the other day said "" it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him |0 who | will do |1 nothing | for you "" ."
|0 He | said |1 it | sarcastically .
"If |0 you | want a |1 doctor | |0 who | will lie to you and say |0 he | will operate and then change his |1 mind | , and not know what |0 he | is talking about when |0 he | recommends |1 procedures | at other hospitals and says |0 they | are |1 what | |0 you | need , when |0 they | will not work for you , go to this doctor ... |0 he | is the one for you ."
|1 What | |0 you | can learn from the below ' bad experience ' .
|0 I | would suggest not avoiding Second |1 Home | based on the ' bad experience ' review .
"|0 I | 'd probably be more inclined to board my two |1 dogs | here , seeing that |0 they | do n't just take every |1 dog | coming in ."
"|0 I | 've toured this |1 place | and was impressed by how clean the |0 place | was , and all the options for the dogs ."
|0 It | 's unfortunate that |0 bmil | believed that his ' perfect ' dog was not given the right |1 opportunity | to prove |1 himself | .
"But |0 I | 've done |1 hundreds | of dog introductions myself ( another place , |0 I | do n't work here ) , and |0 owners | can have unrealistic |1 expectations | and views of what |0 they | see when their |0 dogs | meet other |1 dogs | ."
|0 Workers | |0 who | do these |1 introductions | look at the interaction objectively ; and it 's good to see |0 they | are able and willing to say no if |0 they | feel there would be a |0 problem | .
"|0 It | sounds ( according to your own statement ) that |0 they | had a |1 roomful | of dogs , so |0 they | must be doing |1 something | right - and are keeping those |1 dogs | safe from potential problems ."
"|0 You | say |0 you | work a lot , and that |0 you | have a young |1 dog | ; so |0 I | have little |1 doubt | that your dog is just filled with energy to burn ; and it is good of you to look for a place to take |1 him | ."
But not at a risk to other people 's pets .
"You were clearly given another |1 alternative | by Second Home , to board |1 him | - |0 which | might have given your |2 dog | a |1 chance | to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another |1 attempt | to get into daycare later ."
No |0 business | is going to push |1 customers | away without good reason ; so is n't it reasonable to think |0 they | might know |1 what | |0 they | 're doing ?
"My |0 dogs | are far from perfect , and |0 one | of them |0 I | believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ) ."
"Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this ; and maybe do n't jump to personal attacks suggesting that |0 they | do n't want to work hard , just because |0 you | bruised your own |1 ego | ."
Dumbest F'ers ever
"|0 I | called |1 dominos | tonight , |0 it | rang forever , I get put on hold twice without saying a |1 word | and FINALLY |0 someone | says , MAY |0 I | HELP |1 YOU | ?"
So |0 I | say : |0 I | 'm at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square ( built in 1926 ) do |0 you | deliver to the Warwick ?
"|0 They | say no , Warwick in New Jersey , Call New |1 Jersey | ."
"|0 I | laugh and say , no , that |0 Warwick | is in New York , but |0 I | 'm at the Radison - Warwick ."
And |0 he | says : |0 You | 're at Warwick in Pennsylvania ?
"and |0 I | said , YES , CENTER CITY PHILLY , and |0 he | says , NO , |0 Warwick | is a township , If |0 you | 're at a Radison in Warwick |0 that | s too far , try |1 dominos | in Pottstown ."
"|0 I | say , NO , |0 I | am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square ."
"|0 He | says : |0 I | not know that |1 town | , |0 I | have to get to work , |0 I | 'm in PHILLY ."
Call |1 dominos | in your town .
"|0 I | SAY LISTEN : |0 I | 'm at 17th and LOCUST , do |0 you | deliver there ?"
"|0 He | says , |0 I | have to have an exact |1 ADDRESS | ."
"OK , 1701 LOCUST STREET |0 i | say ."
|0 he | says : Why |0 you | tell |1 me | |0 you | r in WARWICK TOWNSHIP ?
"|0 He | gives the |1 phone | to a girl , |0 she | says , |0 I | have to have your |1 address | , |0 I | say , do |0 you | deliver to 17th and locust , |0 she | says , your exact |1 address | , |0 I | say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 |1 Locust | , ARe |0 you | sure ? |0 she | asks ?"
"YES |0 I | am sure , well , |0 she | says , is |0 that | ON 17th STREET ."
"Yes , |0 I | say ."
"17th , like over by 16th and 15th YES , |0 I | say , one mile west of you ."
|0 You | 're at 7th .
|0 I | am just south of Walnut .
"|0 She | says , Is |0 that | 17th like over past broad ."
"YES , |0 I | am west of broad ."
"|0 Broad | , |0 I | say , is 14th street and |0 I | am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut ."
"Hmmm , |0 she | says , Then why are |0 you | calling here , |0 we | do n't go past broad ?"
"Anyway , after much yelling and cussing |0 I | hung up , grabbed a |1 cab | , and went to Geno 's ."
Quick to take |1 money | but not quick to fix a |1 problem | !
|0 B&B | came out very quickly to give |2 us | our |1 quote | back in June .
"|0 They | were very polite , eager to answer any |1 questions | and willing to wait for |0 us | to return from vacation to begin installing our |1 fence | ."
"Our fence was installed quickly in August and |0 they | had their |1 money | and left saying "" Workmanship is guaranteed for a year ! "" ."
Within a week |0 we | noticed |1 one | of the boards on our gate splitting where a |0 nail | had gone in .
|0 We | called our |1 representative | |0 who | assured |1 me | |0 he | would call the |1 office | and have |1 it | taken |1 care | of .
|0 We | heard |1 nothing | .
|0 We | then called the |1 office | and the |0 man | |0 we | spoke to said |0 he | 'd send |1 someone | out to look at it but could n't promise when - two |0 weeks | came and went and |0 we | heard |1 nothing | .
"|0 I | just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the |0 wood | split due to a nail |0 which | is part of workmanship !"
"|0 She | even went so far as to say "" |0 You | r calling about one board ? """
Well - when |0 you | pay over $ 1000 for something |0 you | want |1 it | to hold up and look good !!!
YES !
|0 I | WAS calling about one board !!
|0 I | 'm very frustrated at this point - |0 it | would take all of 10 |1 min | for |0 them | to come by and replace the one |1 board | that is cracked ( the |0 crack | is deep enough to stick a |1 penny | in it and |0 it | goes clear through ) yet |0 they | do not want to take the |1 time | to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
So |0 I | figure if |0 they | do n't want to take the |1 time | to fix the |1 fence | |1 that | |0 they | installed then |0 I | 'll take the |1 time | to let |1 everyone | |0 I | can know about how |0 they | treat |1 customers | once |0 they | have your |1 money | !!!
STAY AWAY !!!
|0 YOU | GET |1 WHAT | |0 YOU | PAY FOR !!!
|0 They | came in under a lot of other quotes and now |0 I | know why !!!
"When the fence was first installed |0 I | would have given |2 them | five |1 stars | , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the |1 fence | |0 they | have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !"
"Lots of rules , phantom innkeeper , last minute |0 price | was worth |1 it | ."
"|0 I | called the "" 207 "" |1 number | and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before |0 I | gave up ."
|0 I | then called the 800 |1 number | ( which was answered ) and inquired about last minute rates .
"|0 They | had a |1 room | with a $ 99 rate , |1 which | |0 I | booked ."
"The |0 room | was supposed to be on the 2nd floor , but |0 they | put |1 us | on the 3rd ."
"The email |0 confirmation | ( |1 which | |0 I | read in the car ) warned about large suitcases , declaring that |0 we | are innkeepers , not longshoreman ."
"In other words , |0 they | do not help with suitcases , but |0 they | promise |1 totes | to help ."
However upon our arrival no one there ( the |0 inn | was open ) .
So no totes .
"Finally a |0 chambermaid | stuck her |1 head | around the corner from the top of the stairs and told |1 us | sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3 M , no exceptions ."
Then |0 she | was gone .
"|0 We | returned after 3 PM , found no |1 one | there , and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room ."
Rules in the room : # 1 ) if |0 you | drink the |1 soda | from the fridge in your room |0 you | must prove |1 it | by leaving the |1 can | in the trash .
"If |0 they | think |0 you | 've taken a |1 soda | from your room home with you , |0 they | will charge |2 you | |1 $ | 1.50 per can ."
|0 They | count the |1 cans | in the trash to make sure .
"# 2 ) If |0 you | take the shampoo |1 products | home , |0 they | will charge |2 you | |1 $ | 8 per item ."
"# ) If |0 you | want a late |1 checkout | , ( after 11 AM ) |0 they | charge |2 you | |1 $ | 15 for the first hour , charge $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2 PM |0 it | 's a full day charge ."
# 4 ) |0 Breakfast | is 8 AM to 10 AM .
No earlier and no later .
"If |0 you | go later , it 's all cleaned up ."
"( By whom , |0 I | do n't know ."
|0 I | never saw |1 anyone | there .
All these rules are posted in the rooms . )
"Snacks : uninspired bread , tea backs , and individual coffee things for a machine |0 that | did n't exist ."
|0 I | put the coffee |1 thing | in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee .
No wine glasses .
"|0 Room | was clean , but had a weird , dated , sink / stove |1 combo | |0 that | did n't work ."
|0 Bath | was clean except shower stall |0 which | had mildew |1 problems | .
No tub .
"The |0 Inn | touts a |1 shower | with dual shower heads , but only |0 one | worked ."
Do n't get the |1 rooms | off the two kitchens .
|0 They | are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so |0 you | hear |1 everything | .
Free parking .
"|0 I | 'd go back if |0 I | could get the last minute |1 rate | again of $ 99 , but |0 I | would n't pay their rack |1 rate | ."
Quit with the overstatements !
"The worst |0 thing | |0 that | can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many |0 people | write hyperbolic |1 reviews | making |1 claims | that "" |0 everyone | "" is going to "" love "" the |1 food | , decor and service ."
"The |0 truth | is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , |0 this | is a fine little restaurant with some unique food ."
"|0 It | 's an entirely up and down experience , however ."
"Now , the |0 best | of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal ."
The salatim |0 salads | are the smallest plates |0 I | 've ever seen placed in front of me ( |0 you | would most likely think |0 they | were condiments if it were n't explained to you ) .
"Though |0 they | are mostly excellent , |0 you | generally do n't get enough |1 forkfuls | to know if |0 you | really love |1 them | ."
"That being said , the |0 laffa | and hummus are out of this world ."
"Then again , for the three of us |0 who | dined together , two |0 pieces | of flatbread left |1 us | fighting for more , and licking the |1 hummus | from our fingers ( and yes , those two |0 pieces | of flatbread did represent a three - person |1 order | ) ."
|0 Dinner | was also an up - and - down experience .
"The vegetarian |0 dishes | and lighter fare were almost always spot - on , while the |0 lamb | was often dry and / or overcooked ."
"The |0 duck | was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy |0 it | usually represents at other establishments ."
"|0 Dessert | was ... hmmm , |0 that | 's interesting , |0 I | do n't even remember |1 dessert | ."
|0 I | guess |0 that | tells |2 you | a |1 lot | .
"Oh , yes , the chocolate |0 semifreddo | was quite good ."
"The warm chocolate cake was very tasty , but served at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination ."
"And my -- no , |0 I | still do n't remember |1 what | |0 I | had ."
"|0 Service | was average , but nothing special , and |0 restaurants | |0 that | are supposed to be excellent should do a better |1 job | of training their |1 waitstaff | to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable ."
"Perhaps had |0 we | not gone into this restaurant believing |0 Zahav | was going to be golden as its |0 name | suggests ( and as the many golden |0 reviews | seem to attest ) , |0 we | would have enjoyed a decent little expensive |1 experience | ."
"But |0 one | should not go here expecting |1 something | fantastic , unless perhaps |0 you | 've never had middle - eastern |1 food | before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts ."
"PS ) When |0 we | called for a reservation , we were told that |0 5:00 | and 9:30 were their only openings ."
"When |0 we | arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty |0 tables | surrounding |1 us | ."
"Did |0 they | think |0 we | were going to feel lucky to get any |1 reservation | at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ?"
MUST READ - Do not waste your |1 time | in this store .
At my appointment the |0 girl | helping |1 me | was unable to adequately lace up |1 some | of the dresses .
|0 They | felt like |0 they | were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see |1 what | |0 I | would actually look like were |0 I | to purchase |1 some | of these dresses .
|0 I | thought it would be a good idea to see how a |0 few | |1 that | |0 I | liked would look like on a model ( by looking the |1 dress | up online ) .
"So , as |0 I | was leaving |0 I | asked for the designer / dress name or style number associated with my top picks ."
"|0 They | said |0 they | were "" unable to tell |1 me | until |0 they | ordered my |1 dress | "" ."
"Hmmm ... A |0 person | can not call a |1 company | , if |0 you | have no |1 idea | its |1 name | ( since the |0 designer | is unknown ... SUPPOSEDLY ) , and order a |1 gown | without a dress name or style number ."
Do other |0 brides | fall for this ???
"|0 They | either : a ) do n't want to give |1 it | to me because |0 they | do n't want |1 me | purchasing the |1 dress | elsewhere or b ) are recreating the |1 dresses | themselves ( ie STEALING other designers ' dress |1 designs | and "" filling the |1 orders | "" by their own seamstresses ) ."
|0 I | 'm no detective but ... uhh ... seriously ?!?
"Whatever |1 type | of operation |0 they | are running , |0 I | 'm not interested and if |0 you | 're smart , |0 you | wo n't be either ."
|0 What | a waste of TIME .
"Aside from that little * mystery * , |0 one | of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling |2 me | how wrong |0 I | was about how another |0 dress | |1 that | |0 I | loved compared to one of her dresses |1 that | |0 I | was trying on ."
"Somehow , since |0 she | supposedly does n't know any |1 names | of designers / dresses , after |0 I | told |2 her | the designer and dress |1 name | of the one |0 I | was comparing , |0 she | knew "" exactly which dress "" |0 I | was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; |0 she | said that the |0 bodice | did come as low as the one |0 I | had on ."
"My point : Even if |0 I | was wrong , do n't sit there and argue with the customer ."
"Say |1 something | like , "" Huh ."
"|0 I | did n't think so but |0 you | could be right . """
"Unless |0 you | want to take the "" tell the |2 customer | how |1 wrong | |0 she | is and try and force |1 her | into a dress |0 she | 's obviously not loving "" |1 approach | |0 which | will likely get |1 you | ... uh ... nowhere ."
Seriously : do not waste your |1 time | .
Other |0 shops | around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT |1 owners | .
Not owners |0 that | seem like |0 they | have |1 something | to hide and know |1 nothing | about common courtesy and customer service .
|0 I | felt very much like Wedding |0 Gallery | was being dishonest and |0 I | would n't trust |1 them | to lace |1 me | up in another gown let alone trust |1 them | with the gown |0 I | will wear on the most important day of my life .
AWFUL SERVICE !
"After happily visiting Sear's |1 Automotives | in the past , |0 I | was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location ."
|0 I | brought my |1 car | in on a Sunday to replace a shredded |1 tire | .
"|0 I | waited about 20 |1 minutes | in the store part before |0 anyone | was able to assist |1 me | and was then told to pull my |1 car | into the shop ( |0 that | is apparently what |0 you | are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing |2 you | that |1 way | are for some reason kept inside the garage , so |0 you | do n't see |1 them | drving up , and |0 they | purposely block the front pull - |1 up | |1 that | all other |0 Sear's | use ) ."
"Once inside , |0 I | had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a |0 technician | got to me ."
"Once |0 I | returned to pick up my |1 car | , |0 you | can believe |0 I | spent quite a bit MORE |1 time | standing around waiting ."
|0 I | had wanted to split the |1 total | between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told |0 this | was n't possible .
"Once |0 I | actually got back in my car , |0 it | was dirty and had |1 grease | all over the steering wheel ."
"OK , one bad experience ... fine ."
"The following Friday , |0 I | returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 |1 tires | , |0 which | were worn ."
"|0 I | would not have gone back , but |0 I | could n't find the particular |1 tire | |0 they | 'd used in stock anywhere else ."
"Once again , |0 I | waited for quite a bit before being attended to ."
"|0 I | got the |1 order | completed , and then questioned the |1 technician | since |0 it | came out about |1 $ | 40 less than |0 I | expected ."
"|0 He | said |0 it | was the same tire , and verified |1 this | , after checking both the actual |1 tire | on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week ."
"However , when |0 he | printed out the service |1 quote | , |0 I | could see that |0 it | was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model ."
"So |0 I | pointed |1 this | out to him , at which point |0 he | said |0 they | only had |1 one | of the correct tires in stock ."
Ok -- fine .
So |0 I | got just my other rear |1 tire | replaced .
"|0 They | promised it 'd be done within an hour , so |0 I | waited in the lobby ."
Over two hours later ( and ten minutes before |0 they | closed ) my car was finally finished .
"A few minutes after |0 I | left , I was called and informed that "" |0 I | "" left my wheel |1 lock | ( |1 which | |0 they | should have left in the car ) ."
"Of course , |0 they | would be closing in 5 minutes , so |0 I | would have to hurry up or get |1 it | the next day ."
Of course |0 I | could n't make |1 it | back in time ( and |0 they | apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ) .
"The next day , no |0 one | could find my wheel |1 lock | and that particular |0 technician | was not in ."
"Of course , |0 they | could n't call |1 him | either to ask about it because apparently |0 they | do n't keep their employees ' phone |1 numbers | ( riiight ) , so |0 I | would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should |0 I | get a |1 flat | ) ."
On Monday |0 I | called and again it was a big to - do to find |1 anyone | |0 who | knew |1 anything | about it .
"Supposedly |0 they | will be holding |1 it | for me this evening , but |0 I | 'm sure |0 that | will also be a huge ordeal ."
The |0 employees | at this Sear's are completely apathetic and there did n't seem to be any |0 sort | of management |1 that | |0 I | could see .
|0 I | will never return there again ( and now have some serious |1 doubts | about the quality of work |0 they | actually performed on my car ) .
