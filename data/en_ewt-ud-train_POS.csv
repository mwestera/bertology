[ |6 This | |2 killing | of |6 a | |0 respected | |2 cleric | |5 will | |5 be | |4 causing | |3 us | |2 trouble | for |2 years | to |4 come | . ]
|7 DPA | : |0 Iraqi | |2 authorities | |4 announced | that |3 they | |5 had | |4 busted | up 3 |0 terrorist | |2 cells | |4 operating | in |7 Baghdad | .
Two of |3 them | |5 were | |5 being | |4 run | by 2 |2 officials | of |6 the | |7 Ministry | of |6 the | |7 Interior | !
"|6 The | |7 MoI | in |7 Iraq | |5 is | |0 equivalent | to |6 the | |7 US | |7 FBI | , |1 so | |3 this | |5 would | |4 be | like |4 having | |7 J. | |7 Edgar | |7 Hoover | |1 unwittingly | |4 employ | at |6 a | |0 high | |2 level | |2 members | of |6 the | |7 Weathermen | |2 bombers | |1 back | in |6 the | |2 1960s | ."
|6 The | |0 third | |5 was | |5 being | |4 run | by |6 the | |2 head | of |6 an | |2 investment | |2 firm | .
|3 You | |4 wonder | if |3 he | |5 was | |4 manipulating | |6 the | |2 market | with |3 his | |2 bombing | |2 targets | .
|6 The | |2 cells | |5 were | |4 operating | in |6 the | |7 Ghazaliyah | and |7 al | - |7 Jihad | |2 districts | of |6 the | |2 capital | .
"Although |6 the | |2 announcement | |5 was | |1 probably | |4 made | to |4 show | |2 progress | in |4 identifying | and |4 breaking | up |2 terror | |2 cells | , |3 I | |5 do | n't |4 find | |6 the | |2 news | that |6 the | |7 Baathists | |4 continue | to |4 penetrate | |6 the | |0 Iraqi | |2 government | |1 very | |0 hopeful | ."
|3 It | |4 reminds | |3 me | |1 too | |1 much | of |6 the | |7 ARVN | |2 officers | |3 who | |5 were | |1 secretly | |4 working | for |6 the | |0 other | |2 side | in |7 Vietnam | .
|7 Al | - |7 Zaman | : |2 Guerrillas | |4 killed | |6 a | |2 member | of |6 the | |7 Kurdistan | |7 Democratic | |7 Party | after |4 kidnapping | |3 him | in |7 Mosul | .
"|6 The | |2 police | |2 commander | of |7 Ninevah | |7 Province | |4 announced | that |2 bombings | |5 had | |4 declined | 80 |2 percent | in |7 Mosul | , whereas |3 there | |5 had | |4 been | |6 a | |0 big | |2 jump | in |6 the | |2 number | of |2 kidnappings | ."
On |7 Wednesday | |2 guerrillas | |5 had | |4 kidnapped | |6 a | |0 cosmetic | |2 surgeon | and |3 his | |2 wife | while |3 they | |5 were | on |3 their | |2 way | |1 home | .
"In |7 Suwayrah | , |7 Kut | |7 Province | , two |2 car | |2 bombs | |5 were | |4 discovered | before |3 they | |5 could | |5 be | |4 detonated | ."
"( |7 Kut | |5 is | in |0 southeastern | |7 Iraq | and |4 has | |6 an | |1 overwhelmingly | |0 Shiite | |2 population | , |3 who | |5 are | on |6 the | |2 lookout | for |7 Baathist | |2 saboteurs | and |1 willingly | |4 turn | |3 them | in ."
|6 This | |2 willingness | |5 is | |6 the | |0 main | |2 difference | in |6 the | |2 number | of |2 bombings | in |6 the | |2 south | as |4 opposed | to |6 the | |2 center | - |2 north | of |6 the | |2 country | . )
"In |7 Baghdad | |7 Kadhim | |7 Talal | |7 Husain | , |0 assistant | |2 dean | at |6 the | |7 School | of |7 Education | at |7 Mustansiriyah | |7 University | , |5 was | |4 assassinated | with |3 his | |2 driver | in |6 the | |7 Salikh | |2 district | ."
"|2 Guerrillas | |4 killed | |6 an | |2 engineer | , |7 Asi | |7 Ali | , from |7 Tikrit | ."
"|3 They | |1 also | |4 killed | |7 Shaikh | |7 Hamid | |7 'Akkab | , |6 a | |2 clan | |2 elder | of |6 a | |2 branch | of |6 the | |7 Dulaim | |2 tribe | in |7 Tikrit | ."
|3 His | |2 mother | |5 was | |1 also | |4 killed | in |6 the | |2 attack | .
Two |0 other | |7 Dulaim | |2 leaders | |5 have | |5 been | |4 killed | in |6 the | |0 past | |2 week | and |6 a | |2 half | .
"|2 Guerrillas | near |7 Hawijah | |4 launched | |6 an | |2 attack | |3 that | |4 left | 6 |0 dead | , |4 including | 4 |0 Iraqi | |2 soldiers | ."
One of |3 them | |5 was | from |6 the | |7 Jubur | |2 tribe | and |5 was | |2 deputy | |2 commander | of |6 the | |7 Hawijah | |2 garrison | .
"Two hundred |2 members | of |6 the | |7 Batawi | |2 clan | of |6 the | |7 Dulaim | |4 demonstrated | in |7 Baghdad | on |7 Friday | , |4 protesting | |6 the | |2 killing | of |3 their | |2 clan | |2 elder | , |7 Shaikh | |7 Kadhim | |7 Sarhid | and 4 of |3 his | |2 sons | , by |2 gunmen | |4 wearing | |0 Iraqi | |2 army | |2 uniforms | ."
"( |3 This | |5 is | |6 a | |1 largely | |0 Sunni | |0 Arab | |2 clan | , and |6 some | |0 Sunni | |2 observers | |5 have | |4 accused | |0 Shiite | |2 elements | in |6 the | |2 government | of |5 being | behind |6 the | |2 assassination | ; |3 it | |5 is | |1 more | |1 likely | |6 the | |2 work | of |0 Sunni | |0 Arab | |2 guerrillas | |4 punishing | |6 the | |7 Batawi | |2 leaders | for |4 cooperating | with |6 the | |7 Dec. | 15 |2 elections | . )"
|7 Al | - |7 Zaman | : |6 The | |0 Iraqi | |7 High | |7 Electoral | |7 Commission | on |7 Friday | |4 denied | |6 a | |2 request | of |6 the | |7 Debaathification | |7 Commission | to |4 exclude | 51 |2 individuals | from |4 running | on |2 party | |2 lists | in |6 the | |7 Dec. | 15 |2 elections | on |2 grounds | of |5 having | |5 been | |1 sufficiently | |0 involved | in |7 Baath | |2 activities | to |4 warrant | |3 their | |5 being | |4 excluded | from |0 civil | |2 office | .
|6 The | |2 Commission | |4 said | |3 it | |4 had | |6 no | |0 legal | |2 grounds | for |6 such | |6 an | |2 exclusion | .
|6 This | |2 item | |5 is | |6 a | |0 small | |2 one | and |1 easily | |4 missed | .
But in |3 my | |2 view | |3 it | |5 is | |1 highly | |0 significant | .
"|6 The | |7 Debaathification | |7 Commission | |5 had | |5 been | |4 pushed | by |7 Ahmad | |7 Chalabi | and |3 his | |7 Iraqi | |7 National | |7 Congress | |1 very | |1 hard | , and |5 had | |4 pushed | |0 many | |0 Sunni | |7 Arabs | into |6 the | |2 arms | of |6 the | |2 guerrillas | ."
"|7 Chalabi | |5 has | |5 been | |1 increasingly | |4 marginalized | within |7 Iraq | , |1 however | , despite |3 his | |2 ties | of |2 clientelage | with |7 Washington | and |7 Tehran | ."
"|3 He | |5 is | |1 no | |1 longer | in |6 the | |0 dominant | |0 Shiite | |2 list | , |6 the | |7 United | |7 Iraqi | |7 Alliance | , and |5 wo | n't |4 have | |0 many | |2 seats | in |6 the | |0 new | |2 parliament | ."
"|6 Some | 2,000 |0 junior | |2 officers | of |6 the | |0 old | |7 Baath | |2 army | |5 have | |5 been | |4 recalled | to |2 duty | in |0 recent | |2 months | , |3 something | |7 Chalabi | |5 would | |5 have | |4 blocked | if |3 he | |5 could | |4 have | ."
|1 Now | |6 the | |7 Electoral | |7 Commission | |5 is | |4 refusing | to |4 punish | |2 people | for |0 mere | |0 past | |7 Baath | |7 Party | |2 membership | .
|6 The | |2 situation | in |7 Iraq | |5 is | |1 only | |4 going | to |4 get | |0 better | |6 this | |2 way | .
"If |3 someone | |4 committed | |6 a | |2 crime | against |2 humanity | , |4 prosecute | |6 the | |2 person | ."
"If |3 he | or |3 she | |4 did | not , |1 then | |3 they | |5 should | |4 have | |6 all | |6 the | |0 same | |2 rights | as |0 other | |7 Iraqis | ."
|7 Al | - |7 Sharq | |7 al | - |7 Awsat | |4 reports | that |6 a | |0 key | |2 eyewitness | in |6 the | |2 trial | of |7 Saddam | |7 Hussein | for |6 a | 1982 |2 massacre | at |7 Dujail | |5 has | |4 died | .
|6 A | |2 team | from |6 the | |2 court | |4 managed | to |4 take | |3 his | |2 deposition | before |3 he | |4 died | .
|6 The | |2 trial | |4 begins | |1 again | |7 Nov. | 28 .
"In |7 Baghdad | |6 the | |2 fighting | |1 still | |4 continues | in |0 several | |2 areas | , |1 mostly | in |7 Sadr | |2 city | and |7 Adhamiya | ."
"|7 Baghdadis | |5 do | n't |4 venture | |1 much | out of |3 their | |2 neighbourhoods | |1 any | |1 more | , |3 you | |1 never | |4 know | |1 where | |3 you | |5 might | |4 get | |0 stuck | ."
|3 There | |5 has | |4 been | |2 talk | that |6 the | |2 night | |2 curfew | |5 might | |5 be | |4 implemented | |1 again | .
"|3 My | |2 neighbourhood | |5 has | |5 been | |4 surrounded | by |0 American | |2 troops | for three |2 days | |1 now | , |2 helicopters | |5 have | |5 been | |4 circling | over |3 our | |2 heads | |1 non-stop | ."
|2 Fedayeen | |5 are | |1 now | |0 visible | on |6 the | |2 street | and |3 they | |5 have | |4 become | |0 bolder | than |1 ever | .

"|3 They | |5 are | |4 setting | |6 the | |2 road | |2 blocks | at |6 the | |1 exact | |0 same | |2 positions | |3 they | |4 were | during |6 the | |2 war | |0 last | |2 year | , |3 which | |4 indicates | |3 they | |5 are | |6 the | |0 same | |2 people | ."
"And |3 there | |4 is | |3 nothing | |3 we | |5 can | |4 do | about |3 it | |1 really | , |2 people | |3 who | |5 are | |4 suggesting | that |3 we | |4 go | |1 out | and |4 fight | |3 them | |5 are | |4 living | in |2 dream | |2 land | ."
"|1 Even | |6 the | |7 IP | and |7 ICDC | |5 have | |4 abandoned | |6 the | |2 neighbourhood | , and |3 those | |5 are | |0 trained | and |0 armed | , |1 so | |5 do | n't |4 expect | |0 scared | |2 civilians | to |4 do | |3 anything | except to |4 hide | |1 inside | and |4 pray | |6 a | |2 helicopter | or |6 a | |2 tank | |5 does | n't |4 bomb | |3 them | , and |1 also | |1 how | |5 are | |0 American | |2 soldiers | |4 going | to |4 distinguish | |6 the | |0 brave | and |0 valiant | |2 civilians | from |6 the | |2 Fedayeen | ?"
"|3 Everyone | |5 is | |0 apprehensive | , |3 there | |4 is | |6 some | |2 talk | that |7 April | |2 9th | and |2 10th | |5 are | |4 going | to |5 be | |0 bloody | |2 days | ."
"|0 Most | |2 people | |5 have | n't |4 gone | to |2 work | |6 the | |0 last | |0 few | |2 days | , although |3 it | |4 seems | that |6 the | |2 rest | of |7 Baghdad | |5 is | ' |0 normal | ' ( if |3 you | |5 can | |4 define | |3 what | |2 normal | |4 is | ) ."
"|3 There | |4 are | |2 rumours | about |2 preparations | by |2 slum | |2 dwellers | for |6 another | |2 looting | |2 spree | against |2 banks | , |0 governmental | and |0 public | |2 property | |0 similar | to |6 the | |2 one | |3 that | |4 took | |2 place | |0 last | |7 April | , and |3 I | |5 have | |1 already | |4 overheard | |2 youngsters | in |3 my | |2 neighbourhood | |4 joking | about |3 it | and |4 saying | |2 things | like "" |6 This | |2 time | |3 we | |5 will | |5 be | |6 the | |0 first | to |4 loot | , |3 we | |5 did | n't |4 get | |3 anything | |6 the | |0 last | |2 time | "" ."

"|3 What | |4 irritates | |3 me | |5 is | |6 this | |0 sudden | |0 false | ' |2 solidarity | ' between |0 Sunni | and |0 Shi'ite | |2 clerics | , |3 we | |6 all | |4 know | that |3 they | |5 would | |5 be | |0 glad | to |4 get | at |6 each | |0 other | s |2 throats | |1 when | |3 they | |4 have | |6 the | |2 chance | , and |0 Shia | |2 clerics | |5 were | |4 describing | |0 Fallujan | |2 insurgents | as ' |7 Ba'athists | ' , ' |7 Saddamites | ' , ' |7 Wahhabis | ' , and ' |2 terrorists | ' |1 just | |6 a | |0 few | |2 days | |1 ago | ."

|3 This | |5 is | not |6 a | |2 post | about |2 fault | - |2 finding | or |4 assigning | |2 blame | .
|3 It | |5 is | |6 a | |2 time | to |4 learn | |3 what | |4 happened | and |1 how | |3 it | |5 may | |4 affect | |6 the | |2 future | .
|3 There | |5 was | |6 a | |0 soothing | |0 authoritative | |7 UNSCEAR | ( |7 United | |7 Nations | |7 Scientific | |7 Committee | on |6 the | |7 Effects | of |7 Atomic | |7 Radiation | ) |2 report | in 2000 on |6 the | |2 health | |2 effects | of |7 Chernobyl | |4 confirming | that |3 there | |4 was | |6 no | |0 scientific | |2 evidence | of |6 any | |0 significant | |2 radiation | - |0 related | |2 health | |2 effects | to |0 most | |2 people | |4 exposed | .
|3 This | |5 was | |1 heavily | |4 promoted | by |6 the | |7 Australasian | |7 Radiation | |7 Protection | |7 Society | in |6 a | |2 press | |2 release | |4 titled | |6 THE | |7 MYTHS | OF |7 CHERNOBYL | |3 which | |4 contained | |6 the | |4 following | :
"One of |6 the | |1 most | |0 widespread | |2 myths | of |0 recent | |2 times | |4 is | that |6 the | |7 Chernobyl | |0 nuclear | |2 reactor | |2 accident | in 1986 |4 caused | |0 many | |2 thousands | of |0 extra | |2 cancer | |2 deaths | in |4 neighbouring | |2 regions | , and that |0 public | |2 health | |5 has | |5 been | |1 severely | |4 affected | by |2 exposure | to |2 radiation | ."

|2 radiation | :
As |6 a | |2 child | in |6 the | |2 50's | |3 I | |4 had | |6 a | |2 lot | of |0 glandular | |2 problems | and |3 they | |4 treated | |3 it | with |2 radiation | |2 therapy | ( |0 primitive | at |0 best | ! ) and |4 stopped | |1 when | |6 a | |2 lesion | on |3 my | |2 neck | |4 started | |4 enlarging | -- |3 they | |4 said | |3 it | |5 was | not |2 CA | but |4 stopped | |6 the | |2 treatments | ....
|4 Remember | |6 the | |0 old | |2 shoe | |4 sizing | |2 machines | |3 that | |5 was | |6 a | |2 form | of |2 radiation | |2 xray | ?
|3 That | |1 too | |5 was | |4 stopped | .
|5 Do | n't |4 have | to |4 mention | |3 what | |2 radiation | |5 has | |4 done | and |5 is | |1 still | |4 doing | to |7 Hirsohima | & |7 Nagaski | |2 folks | -- |3 there | |5 can | |4 be | |6 no | |2 doubts | about |6 the | |2 effects | of |2 radiation | in |7 Chernobyl | .......
|6 The | |7 Chernobyl | |7 Children | 's |7 Project | ( http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp ) |4 offers | |0 several | |2 ways | to |4 help | |6 the | |2 children | of |6 that | |2 region | .
"One of |3 them | |5 is | |6 the | |7 Rest | and |7 Recuperation | |7 Program | , |1 wherein | |6 a | |2 child | |5 can | |4 come | to |6 the | |7 US | for |6 a | |0 few | |2 weeks | in |6 the | |2 summer | ."
"|1 Even | |6 a | |0 little | |2 time | |4 spent | |4 receiving | |0 wholesome | , |0 uncontaminated | |2 food | , |0 good | |0 medical | |2 care | , etc. |5 can | |4 add | |2 years | to |3 their | |2 lives | ."
|7 S. | and |3 I | |4 have | |6 an | |2 acquaintance | |3 who | |5 has | |4 hosted | |0 several | of |6 these | |2 children | for |0 many | |2 years | ; to |4 see | |6 these | |0 little | |2 ones | |4 breaks | |6 the | |2 heart | .
"|6 The | |2 urge | to |4 protect | and |4 gather | |3 them | |6 all | |1 in | |5 is | |1 almost | |0 overwhelming | , and |4 makes | |3 me | |1 more | |0 grateful | for |6 the | |2 blessings | |3 I | |4 have | ."

|3 I | |5 'm | |0 sorry | to |4 say | |7 Elena | 's |2 story | |5 has | |5 been | |4 revealed | to |5 be | |6 a | |2 fake | .
|3 What | |5 do | |6 the | |0 new | |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | |2 videotape | and |2 audio | |2 speeches | of |7 Bin | |7 Laden | and |7 Ayman | |7 al | - |7 Zawahiri | |4 tell | |3 us | about |6 the | |2 hopes | of |6 the | |0 remaining | |0 top | |2 leadership | of |6 the | |2 organization | ?
"Because |6 the | |7 US | and |7 Pakistan | |5 have | |4 managed | to |4 capture | or |4 kill | |1 about | 2 / |2 3s | of |6 the | |0 top | 25 |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | |2 commanders | , |6 the | |0 middle | |2 managers | |5 are | not in |0 close | |2 contact | with |7 al | - |7 Zawahiri | and |7 Bin | |7 Laden | ."
|6 The | |2 tape | |5 was | |6 a | |2 way | to |4 signal | |2 priorities | .
"|3 These | |4 are | 1 ) |4 Assassinate | or |4 overthrow | |7 Gen. | |7 Pervez | |7 Musharraf | , |6 the | |0 Pakistani | |0 military | "" |2 president | "" |3 who | |5 had | |4 made | |6 a | |2 coup | in 1999 and |5 has | |4 thrown | |1 in | |3 his | |2 lot | with |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | against |6 the | |7 Taliban | and |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | ."
|7 Musharraf | |5 has | |5 been | |4 trying | to |4 purge | |3 his | |2 officer | |2 corps | of |6 the | |0 substantial | |2 number | of |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | |2 sympathizers | .
"|3 His | |0 military | |2 intelligence | |5 has | |4 captured | |0 major | |2 figures | like |7 Abu | |7 Zubayda | and |7 Khalid | |7 Shaykh | |7 Muhammad | , |1 as | |1 well | as |1 nearly | 500 |0 other | |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | |2 operatives | , |1 over | 400 of |3 whom | |6 the | |7 Pakistanis | |5 have | |4 turned | over to |6 the | |7 US | ."
"|7 Musharraf | |4 held | |2 elections | in |7 October | of 2002 , in |3 which | |2 center | - |0 right | |2 parties | |4 did | |1 well | , but in |3 which | |1 nearly | 20 |2 percent | of |2 parliament | |2 seats | |4 went | to |6 the | |0 fundamentalist | |0 religious | |2 party | |2 coalition | , |7 MMA | ."
"|7 MMA | |1 also | |4 captured | |6 the | |7 Northwest | |7 Frontier | |7 Province | , |3 which | |1 probably | |4 shelters | |7 Bin | |7 Laden | and |7 al | - |7 Zawahiri | , and |5 is | in |6 a | |0 joint | |2 government | of |7 Baluchistan | |7 Province | , |1 also | on |6 the | |7 Afghanistan | |2 border | ."
"If |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | |5 can | |4 kill | |7 Musharraf | or |4 instigate | |6 a | |0 military | |2 coup | against |3 him | by |7 Islamist | |0 junior | |2 officers | , |3 they | |5 can | |4 hope | to |4 catapult | |6 the | |7 MMA | to |2 power | as |0 political | |2 allies | and |2 hosts | ."
"|3 They | |5 would | |1 thereby | |4 gain | |2 control | of |6 a | |0 major | |2 base | for |0 terrorist | |2 operations | , |3 which | |5 is | |1 also | |6 a | |0 nuclear | |2 power | ."
"|6 All | |6 this | |5 is | |1 highly | |0 unlikely | , as with |0 most | |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | |2 crackpot | |2 schemes | ."
But |1 so | |5 was | |3 it | |0 unlikely | that |6 a | |0 small | |2 group | of |0 Arab | |2 mujahidin | |5 would | |1 virtually | |4 take | over |7 Afghanistan | .
|2 Response | : |6 The | |7 US | |5 must | |4 do | |3 whatever | |3 it | |5 can | to |4 strengthen | |6 the | |2 legitimacy | of |6 the | |0 Pakistani | |2 government | .
"On |6 the | one |2 hand | , |3 it | |5 should | |4 pressure | |7 Musharraf | to |4 take | off |3 his | |2 uniform | and |4 run | for |2 president | in |6 a | |0 fair | |2 election | , and to |4 repeal | |6 the | |0 contentious | "" |7 Legal | |7 Framework | |7 Order | "" |3 that | |1 essentially | |4 perpetuates | |3 his | |2 dictatorship | ."

"On |6 the | |0 other | |2 hand | , |6 the | |7 US | |5 should | |0 strong | - |4 arm | |7 India | and |7 Pakistan | into |6 a | |0 final | |2 settlement | of |6 the | |7 Kashmir | |2 issue | ."
|7 Al | - |7 Zawahiri | |4 attempted | to |4 use | |7 Musharraf | 's |2 lack | of |2 progress | in |4 helping | |6 the | |7 Muslims | of |6 that | |0 Indian | |2 state | as |6 a | |2 justification | for |3 his | |2 overthrow | .
"|6 The | |7 Kashmir | |2 issue | |4 generates | |1 far | |0 more | |2 terrorism | , and |1 even | |6 the | |2 threat | of |0 nuclear | |2 war | , than |7 Iraq | |1 ever | |4 did | ."
2 ) |4 Target | |7 Israel | and |4 encourage | |6 the | |0 worst | |2 elements | of |6 the | |7 Palestinians | by |4 playing | on |6 the | |0 iron | |2 fist | |2 policies | of |6 the | |7 Sharon | |2 government | .
"|2 Response | : |6 The | |7 US | |5 has | |4 succeeded | in |1 politically | |4 isolating | |7 Hamas | , and |4 started | |6 the | |2 process | of |4 cutting | off |3 its | |2 funding | ."
|6 This | |0 terrorist | |2 organization | |5 can | |1 now | |1 only | |4 pull | off |1 far | |1 less | |0 sophisticated | |2 bombings | and |2 attacks | .
|3 It | |5 should | |4 continue | to |5 be | |4 defanged | .
"But |7 Sharon | 's |0 iron | |2 fist | |5 is | |1 simply | not |4 working | as |6 a | |2 means | of |4 establishing | |0 general | |2 peace | , and |6 the | |7 Bush | |2 administration | |5 will | |4 have | to |1 finally | |4 apply | |0 effective | |2 pressure | on |7 Sharon | to |4 stop | |3 his | |2 outrages | in and |2 colonization | of |6 the | |7 West | |7 Bank | and |7 Gaza | ."
"|7 Sharon | 's |0 hard | |2 line | |5 has | |4 worked | in |2 tandem | with |7 Hamas | 's |2 terrorism | to |4 ratchet | up |2 tensions | |1 further | and |1 further | , |3 which | |4 spill | |1 over | into |6 the | |0 Muslim | |2 world | and |4 serve | as |6 a | |2 recruiting | |2 tool | for |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | in |3 its | |2 search | for |2 agents | |0 willing | to |4 hit | |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | ."
"|7 Israel | |4 owes | |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | |1 at | |1 least | |1 this | |0 much | , in |6 this | |2 crisis | , to |4 cease | |1 militarily | |0 unnecessary | |2 provocations | and |4 establish | |0 genuine | |2 peace | ."
"3 ) |4 Make | |7 Iraq | |6 another | |7 Afghanistan | , |4 using | |6 the | |7 Republican | |7 Right | 's |0 own | |2 tactics | against |3 them | ."
"|2 Response | : |7 Iraq | |5 is | |1 actually | |0 hostile | |2 territory | for |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | , and without |0 Iraqi | |2 sympathizers | |3 it | |5 can | not |4 succeed | |1 there | ."
"By |4 moving | |1 quickly | to |0 Iraqi | |2 sovereignty | and |2 improvement | of |0 Iraqi | |2 lives | , |6 the | |7 US | |5 may | |5 be | |0 able | to |4 get | |7 Iraqis | on |3 its | |2 side | , so that |3 they | |4 turn | in |6 the | |2 foreigners | ."
"|1 Certainly | , |6 the | |7 Shiites | |1 already | |4 hate | |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | and |5 would | |4 help | ; |1 likewise | |6 the | |7 Kurds | ."
"|6 The | |2 problem | of |4 mollifying | |6 the | |7 Sunnis | , |1 though | , |4 has | to |5 be | |4 solved | to |4 avoid | |4 giving | |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | |6 an | |2 entrée | ."
|6 The | |7 Americans | |4 have | to |4 put | |1 away | |3 their | |0 free | - |2 market | |2 fetishism | for |6 a | |2 while | and |4 find | |2 ways | of |4 creating | |2 jobs | and |4 pumping | |2 money | into |0 Iraqi | |2 households | .
"|3 We | |4 need | |6 an | |7 FDR | in |7 Iraq | , |1 not | |6 a | |7 Ronald | |7 Reagan | ."
"|1 Of | |1 course | , |6 the | |1 sooner | |6 the | |7 US | |2 soldiers | |5 can | |5 be | |4 withdrawn | in |2 favor | of |1 less | - |0 provocative | |0 local | or |0 international | |2 forces | , |6 the | |0 better | ."
|4 Getting | |6 the | |0 Spanish | out of |7 Iraq | |5 is | n't |1 nearly | |1 as | |0 good | |6 a | |2 rallying | |2 cry | for |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | in |6 the | |0 Arab | |2 world | as |4 getting | |6 the | |7 Americans | and |0 British | |1 out | .
"|6 The | |2 thing | to |4 keep | in |2 mind | |4 is | that |0 Sunni | |0 Arab | |2 nationalists | and |7 Baathists | and |0 local | |0 Sunni | |2 radicals | |5 are | |0 likely | to |4 remain | |1 far | |1 more | |0 dangerous | to |6 the | |7 US | in |7 Iraq | than |7 al | - |7 Qaeda | |2 infiltrators | , and |3 it | |5 would | |5 be | |0 dangerous | to |4 take | |3 one | 's |2 eyes | off |6 the | |0 former | |2 ball | ."
|7 George | |7 W. | |7 Bush | |4 alleged | |7 Thursday | that |7 John | |7 Edwards | |4 lacks | |6 the | |2 experience | |0 necessary | to |5 be | |7 president | .
"|6 The | |2 problem | with |6 this | |2 argument | |4 is | that |7 Bush | |4 lacked | |6 the | |2 experience | |0 necessary | to |5 be | |7 president | |1 when | |3 he | |4 ran | in 2000 , |1 so | |6 this | |2 sort | of |0 cheap | |2 shot | |1 just | |4 hoists | |3 him | by |3 his | |0 own | |2 petard | ."

"|1 Ironically | , among |6 the | |0 strongest | |2 proponents | of |2 war | in |7 Iraq | |5 were | |0 Israeli | |7 Prime | |7 Minister | |7 Ariel | |7 Sharon | and |3 his | |0 neoconservative | |2 supporters | in |6 the | |7 US | ."

|3 What | |5 do | |3 you | |1 really | |4 know | about |7 George | |7 W. | |7 Bush | ’s |2 time | in |6 the | |7 Air | |7 National | |7 Guard | ?
That |3 he | |5 did | n’t |4 show | up for |2 duty | in |7 Alabama | ?
That |3 he | |4 missed | |6 a | |2 physical | ?
That |3 his | |2 daddy | |4 got | |3 him | |1 in | ?
|2 News | |2 coverage | of |6 the | |7 president | ’s |2 years | in |6 the | |7 Guard | |5 has | |4 tended | to |4 focus | on one |0 brief | |2 portion | of |6 that | |2 time | — to |6 the | |2 exclusion | of |1 virtually | |3 everything | |0 else | .
"|1 So | |1 just | for |6 the | |2 record | , |1 here | , in |0 full | , |5 is | |3 what | |7 Bush | |4 did | :"
|6 The | |0 future | |2 president | |4 joined | |6 the | |7 Guard | in |7 May | 1968 .
"|1 Almost | |1 immediately | , |3 he | |4 began | |6 an | |0 extended | |2 period | of |2 training | ."
Six |2 weeks | of |0 basic | |2 training | .
Fifty - three |2 weeks | of |2 flight | |2 training | .
Twenty - one |2 weeks | of |2 fighter | - |2 interceptor | |2 training | .
"|3 That | |5 was | 80 |2 weeks | to |4 begin | with , and |3 there | |4 were | |0 other | |2 training | |2 periods | |4 thrown | |1 in | |1 as | |1 well | ."
|3 It | |5 was | |0 full | - |2 time | |2 work | .
"By |6 the | |2 time | |3 it | |5 was | |1 over | , |7 Bush | |5 had | |4 served | |1 nearly | two |2 years | ."
|1 Not | two |2 years | of |2 weekends | .
Two |2 years | .
"After |2 training | , |7 Bush | |4 kept | |4 flying | , |4 racking | up |2 hundreds | of |2 hours | in |7 F | - 102 |2 jets | ."
"As |3 he | |4 did | , |3 he | |4 accumulated | |2 points | toward |3 his | |7 National | |7 Guard | |2 service | |2 requirements | ."
"At |6 the | |2 time | , |2 guardsmen | |5 were | |4 required | to |4 accumulate | |6 a | |2 minimum | of 50 |2 points | to |4 meet | |3 their | |0 yearly | |2 obligation | ."
"|4 According | to |2 records | |4 released | |1 earlier | |6 this | |2 year | , |7 Bush | |4 earned | 253 |2 points | in |3 his | |0 first | |2 year | , |7 May | 1968 to |7 May | 1969 ( since |3 he | |4 joined | in |7 May | 1968 , |3 his | |2 service | |1 thereafter | |5 was | |4 measured | on |6 a | |7 May | - to - |7 May | |2 basis | ) ."
|7 Bush | |4 earned | 340 |2 points | in 1969 - 1970 .
"[ In |0 other | |2 words | , |7 Bush | |4 earned | |0 enough | |2 points | to |4 satisfy | |6 the | |2 requirements | for |3 his | |0 entire | six |2 year | |2 hitch | in 1969 - 1970 |1 alone | ."
- |7 acd | ]
|3 He | |4 earned | 137 |2 points | in 1970 - 1971 .
And |3 he | |4 earned | 112 |2 points | in 1971 - 1972 .
"|6 The | |2 numbers | |4 indicate | that in |3 his | |0 first | four |2 years | , |7 Bush | not |1 only | |4 showed | up , |3 he | |4 showed | up |6 a | |2 lot | ."
|5 Did | |3 you | |4 know | |3 that | ?
"|3 That | |4 brings | |6 the | |2 story | to |7 May | 1972 — |6 the | |2 time | |3 that | |5 has | |5 been | |6 the | |2 focus | of |1 so | |0 many | |2 news | |2 reports | — |1 when | |7 Bush | “ |4 deserted | ” ( |4 according | to |0 anti-Bush | |2 filmmaker | |7 Michael | |7 Moore | ) or |4 went | “ |0 AWOL | ” ( |4 according | to |7 Terry | |7 McAuliffe | , |2 chairman | of |6 the | |7 Democratic | |7 National | |7 Committee | ) ."
|7 Bush | |4 asked | for |2 permission | to |4 go | to |7 Alabama | to |4 work | on |6 a | |7 Senate | |2 campaign | .
|3 His | |0 superior | |2 officers | |4 said | OK .
"|2 Requests | like |3 that | |5 were | n’t |0 unusual | , |4 says | |4 retired | |7 Col. | |7 William | |7 Campenni | , |3 who | |4 flew | with |7 Bush | in 1970 and 1971 ."
"“ In 1972 , |3 there | |4 was | |6 an | |0 enormous | |2 glut | of |2 pilots | , ” |7 Campenni | |4 says | ."
"“ |6 The | |7 Vietnam | |7 War | |5 was | |4 winding | down , and |6 the | |7 Air | |7 Force | |5 was | |4 putting | |2 pilots | in |2 desk | |2 jobs | ."
"In ’72 or ’73 , if |3 you | |5 were | |6 a | |2 pilot | , |0 active | or |7 Guard | , and |3 you | |4 had | |6 an | |2 obligation | and |4 wanted | to |4 get | |1 out | , |6 no | |2 problem | ."
"In |2 fact | , |3 you | |5 were | |4 helping | |3 them | |4 solve | |3 their | |2 problem | . ”"
|1 So | |7 Bush | |4 stopped | |4 flying | .
"From |7 May | 1972 to |7 May | 1973 , |3 he | |4 earned | |1 just | 56 |2 points | — |1 not | |0 much | , but |0 enough | to |4 meet | |3 his | |2 requirement | ."
"|1 Then | , in 1973 , as |7 Bush | |4 made | |2 plans | to |4 leave | |6 the | |7 Guard | and |4 go | to |7 Harvard | |7 Business | |7 School | , |3 he | |1 again | |4 started | |4 showing | up |1 frequently | ."
"In |7 June | and |7 July | of 1973 , |3 he | |4 accumulated | 56 |2 points | , |0 enough | to |4 meet | |6 the | |2 minimum | |2 requirement | for |6 the | 1973 - 1974 |2 year | ."
"|1 Then | , at |3 his | |2 request | , |3 he | |5 was | |4 given | |2 permission | to |4 go | ."
"|7 Bush | |4 received | |6 an | |0 honorable | |2 discharge | after |4 serving | five |2 years | , four |2 months | and five |2 days | of |3 his | |0 original | six - |2 year | |2 commitment | ."
"By |6 that | |2 time | , |1 however | , |3 he | |5 had | |4 accumulated | |0 enough | |2 points | in |6 each | |2 year | to |4 cover | six |2 years | of |2 service | ."
"During |3 his | |2 service | , |7 Bush | |4 received | |0 high | |2 marks | as |6 a | |2 pilot | ."
|6 A | 1970 |2 evaluation | |4 said | |7 Bush | “ |1 clearly | |4 stands | out as |6 a | |0 top | |2 notch | |2 fighter | |2 interceptor | |2 pilot | ” and |5 was | “ |6 a | |0 natural | |2 leader | |3 whom | |3 his | |2 contemporaries | |4 look | to for |2 leadership | . ”
|6 A | 1971 |2 evaluation | |4 called | |7 Bush | “ |6 an | |1 exceptionally | |0 fine | |0 young | |2 officer | and |2 pilot | ” |3 who | “ |1 continually | |4 flies | |2 intercept | |2 missions | with |6 the | |2 unit | to |4 increase | |3 his | |2 proficiency | |1 even | |1 further | . ”
And |6 a | 1972 |2 evaluation | |4 called | |7 Bush | “ |6 an | |0 exceptional | |2 fighter | |2 interceptor | |2 pilot | and |2 officer | . ”
"|1 Now | , |3 it | |5 is | |1 only | |0 natural | that |2 news | |2 reports | |4 questioning | |7 Bush | ’s |2 service | — in |6 The | |7 Boston | |7 Globe | and |6 The | |7 New | |7 York | |7 Times | , on |7 CBS | and in |0 other | |2 outlets | — |5 would | |4 come | |1 out | |1 now | ."
|7 Democrats | |5 are | |1 spitting | |0 mad | over |2 attacks | on |7 John | |7 Kerry | ’s |2 record | by |6 the | |2 group | |7 Swift | |7 Boat | |7 Veterans | for |7 Truth | .
"And , as |3 it | |4 is | with |7 Kerry | , |3 it | |5 ’s | |0 reasonable | to |4 look | at |6 a | |2 candidate | ’s |0 entire | |2 record | , |4 including | |3 his | |0 military | |2 service | — or |2 lack | of |3 it | ."
|2 Voters | |5 are | |1 perfectly | |0 able | to |4 decide | whether |3 it | |5 ’s | |0 important | or not in |7 November | .
"|6 The | |7 Kerry | |2 camp | |4 blames | |7 Bush | for |6 the | |7 Swift | |7 boat | |7 veterans | ’ |2 attack | , but |3 anyone | |3 who | |5 has | |4 spent | |0 much | |2 time | |4 talking | to |6 the | |7 Swifties | |4 gets | |6 the | |2 sense | that |3 they | |5 are | |4 doing | |3 it | |1 entirely | for |3 their | |0 own | |2 reasons | ."
"And |3 it | |5 should | |5 be | |4 noted | in |2 passing | that |7 Kerry | |5 has | |1 personally | |4 questioned | |7 Bush | ’s |2 service | , while |7 Bush | |5 has | not |1 personally | |4 questioned | |7 Kerry | ’s ."
"In |7 April | — before |6 the | |7 Swift | |7 boat | |7 veterans | |5 had | |4 said | |6 a | |2 word | — |7 Kerry | |4 said | |7 Bush | “ |4 has | |1 yet | to |4 explain | to |7 America | whether or |1 not | , and |4 tell | |6 the | |2 truth | , about whether |3 he | |4 showed | up for |2 duty | . ”"
"|1 Earlier | , |7 Kerry | |4 said | , “ |1 Just | because |3 you | |4 get | |6 an | |0 honorable | |2 discharge | |5 does | not , in |2 fact | , |4 answer | |6 that | |2 question | . ”"
"|1 Now | , after |6 the | |7 Swift | |7 boat | |2 episode | , |6 the | |2 spotlight | |5 has | |4 returned | to |7 Bush | ."
|3 That | |5 ’s | |0 fine | .
|3 We | |5 should | |4 know | |1 as | |0 much | as |3 we | |5 can | .

"On |4 sensing | |3 my | |2 incredulity | to |3 his | |2 statement | |3 he | |4 asserted | that |7 Ba'athist | |2 cells | |4 exist | in |6 all | |2 parts | of |6 the | |2 country | and that |3 they | |5 do | |4 have | |6 a | |0 central | |2 command | , |1 even | though |0 many | |5 have | |4 formed | |0 seperate | |2 cells | ( |1 often | under |0 Islamic | |2 labels | ) with |3 their | |0 own | |2 leaderships | ."

"But |3 I | |1 also | |4 see | |3 that | as |6 a | |0 fatal | |2 misconception | , |3 which | |5 is | |4 doing | |7 Sunnis | |2 harm | , because |3 I | |5 do | n't |4 believe | |6 the | |7 US | |5 is | |4 going | |1 anywhere | |1 so | |1 soon | ."
"|6 Any | |2 government | |3 that | |4 assumes | |2 power | after |6 the | |2 elections | |1 also | |4 realises | |3 this | , |1 so | |1 not | |1 even | |7 Sistani | |5 is | |4 going | to |4 call | |6 the | |7 US | to |4 withdraw | |3 its | |2 troops | , despite |3 what | |3 he | |5 is | |4 saying | |1 now | , not until |3 they | |5 are | |4 ensured | |6 the | |2 insurgency | |5 is | out of |6 the | |2 picture | , or that |3 they | |4 have | |6 an | |0 alternative | |0 foreign | |2 power | ( in |6 this | |2 case | |7 Iran | ) to |4 back | |3 them | up ."

Until |1 then | |3 he | |5 had | |4 said | |7 Pakistan | ’s |2 options | |5 were | |0 open | .
|1 However | |0 Pakistani | |2 officials | |4 insist | that |6 the | |2 decision | |5 was | |0 unconnected | to |6 the | |0 tripartite | |2 meeting | .
|7 US | and |7 NATO | |0 military | |2 officers | in |7 Kabul | |4 say | |3 it | |5 is | |1 too | |0 early | to |4 say | whether |7 Bush | ’s |0 tough | |2 message | |5 was | |0 instrumental | in |4 persuading | |7 Musharraf | and |6 the | |7 ISI | to |4 pressure | |6 the | |7 Taliban | to |4 restrain | from |4 disrupting | |6 the | |2 elections | .
|1 However | |3 there | |4 were | |0 visible | |2 signs | of |6 a | |2 crackdown | on |6 the | |7 Pakistan | |2 side | .

|1 Also | |0 several | |2 days | before |6 the | |2 elections | |7 Pakistan | |4 closed | |6 the | |2 border | |2 crossing | |2 point | at |7 Chaman | in |7 Baluchistan | |3 which | |5 is | |6 a | |0 key | |2 entry | |2 point | for |6 the | |7 Taliban | into |7 Afghanistan | .
|1 However | |7 US | |0 military | |2 officers | |4 say | |0 regular | |2 army | |2 officers | - |0 many | of |3 them | |0 Pashtun | - |4 leading | |2 units | of |6 the | |7 Frontier | |7 Corps | |3 who | |5 are | on |6 the | |2 border | |4 remain | |1 deeply | |0 sympathetic | to |6 the | |7 Taliban | and |6 the | |2 mullahs | of |6 the | |7 JUI | .
At |6 the | |0 same | |2 time | |6 the | |7 US | |4 remains | |0 oblivious | of |6 the | |0 serious | |2 problems | and |0 political | |2 fallout | |3 which | |6 the | |2 army | |5 is | |4 facing | in |3 its | |2 operations | in |7 Waziristan | .

|7 Musharraf | |5 has | |1 always | |4 maintained | that |6 the | |7 US | |5 has | |1 never | |4 provided | |0 actionable | |2 intelligence | about |7 Taliban | |2 leaders | |4 hiding | in |7 Baluchistan | .
|3 That | |1 too | |5 may | |4 change | .

"|1 Moreover | |3 there | |4 are | |1 now | |0 major | |0 covert | |2 attempts | under |2 way | to |4 try | and |4 bring | |1 back | to |7 Kabul | |4 leading | |7 Taliban | |2 commanders | , |3 who | |5 have | |5 been | |4 living | |1 quietly | in |7 Pakistan | and |5 have | |4 taken | |6 no | |2 part | in |6 the | |7 Taliban | |2 insurgency | ."
"With |6 the | |7 Taliban | |2 failure | to |4 disrupt | |6 the | |0 Afghan | |2 elections | , |6 the | |2 militants | |5 are | |1 even | |1 more | |0 isolated | from |6 the | |0 mainstream | |7 Taliban | |3 who | |4 want | to |4 return | |1 home | ."
Until |1 now | |7 Pakistan | |5 has | not |4 facilitated | |6 such | |6 a | |2 return | and |1 clearly | |3 it | |5 can | not |4 happen | until |3 there | |4 is | both |6 a | |2 pull | from |7 Kabul | and |6 a | |2 push | from |7 Islamabad | .

|3 Their | |2 removal | |5 should | |1 also | |4 provide | |4 increased | |2 motivation | for |7 Pakistan | to |4 help | |6 the | |2 return | of |0 moderate | |7 Taliban | .
|0 Afghan | |2 officials | |4 welcomed | |6 the | |2 appointment | on |7 October | 3 of |7 Lt. | |7 General | |7 Ashfaq | |7 Kiyani | as |6 the | |0 new | |7 ISI | |2 chief | .

|7 Karzai | |1 also | |4 has | to |4 deal | with |6 the | |4 stepped | up |2 rivalry | between |7 India | and |7 Pakistan | in |7 Afghanistan | .

"“ |3 There | |4 have | |6 no | |2 business | |5 being | |1 there | unless |3 they | |5 are | |4 undermining | |7 Pakistan | , ’’ |4 says | |6 a | |0 Pakistani | |2 official | ."

|7 Iran | in |0 particular | |4 feared | that |7 Qanooni | |5 would | |4 loose | and |1 then | |5 be | |1 politically | |4 isolated | from |6 the | |2 mainstream | .

|1 However | |0 powerful | |2 hardliners | in |7 Tehran | |5 may | |5 be | |4 trying | to |4 undermine | |6 that | |2 strategy | and |6 a | |0 new | |2 issue | |5 is | |0 likely | to |4 deepen | |6 the | |2 rift | with |6 the | |2 moderates | .

"|6 The | |4 enhanced | |7 US | |2 presence | in |0 western | |7 Afghanistan | |5 was | |1 only | |4 made | |0 possible | after |6 the | |2 ousting | of |7 Ismail | |7 Khan | , |6 the | |2 warlord | and |7 Governor | of |7 Herat | |2 province | |0 last | |2 month | , |3 who | |5 was | |6 a | |0 close | |2 ally | of |0 Iranian | |2 hardliners | ."
|0 Iranian | |2 officials | |4 say | |3 they | |4 made | |6 no | |2 objections | to |7 Khan | ’s |2 ouster | because |3 they | |4 want | to |4 strengthen | |7 Karzai | ’s |2 campaign | against |2 warlords | .

|3 It | |5 is | |6 a | |1 very | |0 potent | |0 psychological | |2 weapon | .
|3 Its | |0 real | |0 direct | |2 impact | |5 is | |1 relatively | |0 minor | .

|1 So | |3 what | |5 is | |6 all | |6 the | |2 fuss | about |2 suicide | |2 killings | ?
|3 It | |4 creates | |2 headlines | .
|3 It | |5 is | |0 spectacular | .
|3 It | |5 is | |0 frightening | .
|3 It | |5 is | |6 a | |1 very | |0 cruel | |2 death | with |2 bodies | |4 dismembered | and |0 horrible | |0 severe | |0 lifelong | |2 injuries | to |0 many | of |6 the | |0 wounded | .

|3 This | |5 has | not |1 yet | |4 penetrated | |6 the | |2 thinking | of |6 the | |7 Western | |7 World | .
"|6 The | |7 U.S. | and |7 Europe | |5 are | |1 constantly | |4 improving | |3 their | |2 defense | against |6 the | |0 last | |2 murder | , |1 not | |6 the | |0 next | one ."
|3 We | |5 may | |4 arrange | for |6 the | |0 best | |2 airport | |2 security | in |6 the | |2 world | .

|3 Who | |5 could | |4 stop | |6 a | |2 suicide | |2 murder | in |6 the | |2 midst | of |6 the | |0 crowded | |2 line | |4 waiting | to |5 be | |4 checked | by |6 the | |2 airport | |2 metal | |2 detector | ?
|1 How | about |6 the | |2 lines | to |6 the | |4 check | - in |2 counters | in |6 a | |0 busy | |2 travel | |2 period | ?
|4 Put | |6 a | |2 metal | |2 detector | in |2 front | of |6 every | |2 train | |2 station | in |7 Spain | and |6 the | |2 terrorists | |5 will | |4 get | |6 the | |2 buses | .
"|4 Protect | |6 the | |2 buses | and |3 they | |5 will | |4 explode | in |2 movie | |2 theaters | , |2 concert | |2 halls | , |2 supermarkets | , |2 shopping | |2 malls | , |2 schools | and |2 hospitals | ."

|3 You | |5 can | |1 somewhat | |4 reduce | |3 your | |2 vulnerability | by |0 preventive | and |0 defensive | |2 measures | and by |0 strict | |2 border | |2 controls | but not |4 eliminate | |3 it | and |1 definitely | not |4 win | |6 the | |2 war | in |6 a | |0 defensive | |2 way | .
And |3 it | |5 is | |6 a | |2 war | !
|3 What | |5 is | behind |6 the | |2 suicide | |2 murders | ?

|3 It | |4 has | |3 nothing | to |4 do | with |0 true | |0 fanatic | |0 religious | |2 beliefs | .

|2 Suicide | |2 murders | |1 also | |4 have | |3 nothing | to |4 do | with |2 poverty | and |2 despair | .
"|6 The | |0 poorest | |2 region | in |6 the | |2 world | , by |1 far | , |5 is | |7 Africa | ."
|3 It | |1 never | |4 happens | |1 there | .

"|6 A | |2 suicide | |2 murder | |5 is | |1 simply | |6 a | |0 horrible | , |0 vicious | |2 weapon | of |0 cruel | , |0 inhuman | , |0 cynical | , |1 well | - |4 funded | |2 terrorists | , with |6 no | |2 regard | to |0 human | |2 life | , |4 including | |6 the | |2 life | of |3 their | |0 fellow | |2 countrymen | , but with |1 very | |0 high | |2 regard | to |3 their | |0 own | |0 affluent | |1 well | - |2 being | and |3 their | |2 hunger | for |2 power | ."

|6 The | |7 FBI | 's |2 fixation | on |7 Hatfill | ( |1 at | |1 least | as |4 rumored | by |6 some | |2 reporters | ) |5 may | |5 have | |4 stemmed | from |6 a | |2 warning | by one |2 Senator | that |2 careers | |4 hung | in |6 the | |2 balance | .

|6 The | |7 Hatfill | |2 theory | -- to |4 include | |0 ongoing | |2 interviews | and |0 ongoing | 7 / 24 |2 surveillance | by 8 |2 surveillance | |2 specialists | -- |5 is | |1 now | |6 the | |2 subject | of |0 pending | |0 civil | |2 rights | and |2 libel | |2 claims | of |0 uncertain | |2 merit | .

"|4 Given | |6 the | |0 regrettable | |2 leaks | that |3 he | |5 was | under |2 suspicion | , |3 it | |5 is | |1 only | |0 fair | that |6 the | |7 FBI | |4 leak | with |0 equal | |2 enthusiasm | |6 the | |2 fact | that |7 Dr. | |7 Hatfill | |5 has | |1 now | |5 been | |4 dropped | as |6 a | |2 suspect | if and |1 when | |3 that | |4 proves | to |5 be | |6 the | |2 case | ."

Hello .
|3 I | |5 was | |1 originally | |4 inquiring | about |4 purchasing | |6 a | |7 Cross | or |7 Signac | |0 impressionist | |2 lithograph | .
"|3 I | |4 found | |3 them | and |4 purchased | |6 both | from |6 a | |2 gallery | in |7 London | , |7 William | |7 Weston | ."
|3 They | |5 should | |5 be | |4 delivered | |6 this | |2 week | .
|3 They | |5 are | |0 beautiful | and |5 will | |4 add | |6 a | |2 lot | to |3 our | |2 collection | .
By |6 the | |2 way | |6 the | |7 Lichtenstein | |4 is | |1 up | and |4 hanging | in |3 our | |0 formal | |2 living | |2 room | and |3 it | |5 is | |0 magnificent | .
|3 I | |5 have | |1 also | |4 purchased | |6 an | |7 Appel | in |6 the | |0 last | |2 month | .
|3 I | |5 am | |0 interested | in |0 several | |2 artists | .
"|1 Actually | , |6 a | |2 lot | ."
|3 I | |5 will | |5 be | |4 looking | for one or |0 more | of |6 the | |4 following | .
|3 My | |2 concept | |4 is | that over |2 time | |3 I | |5 would | |4 like | to |4 own | one of |6 all | |6 the | |4 following | |2 artists | and |3 they | |5 are | |1 all | |4 depending | |1 when | |3 I | |4 find | |3 something | |3 that | |3 we | |1 really | |4 like | .
|3 I | |4 listed | |6 all | of |3 our | ( |1 sometimes | |3 mine | vs. |3 my | |2 wife | 's |2 favorites | and |2 priorities | ) .
|3 They | |5 are | |1 kind | |1 of | in |2 rank | |2 order | but as |3 I | |4 stated | if |3 I | |4 find | |6 the | |2 piece | |3 that | |3 I | |4 like | |3 we | |5 will | |4 purchase | |3 it | .
|3 I | |4 want | |4 signed | and |4 numbered | .
|3 I | |4 realize | that |6 some | |5 were | not |4 signed | by |6 the | |2 artist | but |3 it | |5 is | |6 an | |0 important | |2 fact | in |3 my | |2 buying | |2 decision | .
|3 I | |1 also | |4 realize | that |6 some | |5 may | not |5 have | |4 done | |6 any | |2 works | on |2 paper | or |3 they | |5 are | |1 outrageously | |0 expensive | .
"For |2 example | , |3 I | |5 would | |4 like | to |4 know | if |7 Rothko | or |7 Kline | |4 did | |6 any | |2 work | on |2 paper | ."
|1 At | |1 least | |3 that | |5 is | |3 what | |3 I | |5 am | |4 thinking | |1 now | .
|7 Bonnard | ( |0 colorful | |1 only | )
|7 Lautrec |
|7 Suerat | ( |6 any | |2 works | on |2 paper | ? -
|3 I | |5 do | n't |4 know | that |3 he | |4 did | |6 any | )
|0 Other | |0 impressionist | or post |0 impressionist | |2 lithos |
|7 Braque |
|7 Moore |
|7 Arp |
|7 Rouault |
|7 Modrian |
|7 Rothko |
|7 Kline |

"By |6 the | |2 way | , |3 I | |5 am | |0 interested | in |4 re-looking | at |6 a | |7 Picasso | ( although |3 we | |4 have | 2 ) |3 that | |3 your | |2 gallery | |4 had | |6 a | |2 couple | of |2 years | |1 ago | ."
"|3 It | |5 was | |6 a | |0 cubist | |2 piece | from |6 the | |2 1920s | and |3 I | |4 believe | |3 you | |4 called | |6 the | |2 technique | |6 a | "" |2 push | |2 wa | "" ( |2 pronunciation | Vs |6 an | |2 attempt | at |6 the | |0 proper | |2 spelling | ) ."
"|3 It | |5 was | for |2 sale | in |6 a | |2 couple | of |2 galleries | in |7 SF | and |5 was | |1 about | $ 20,000 ."
|4 Is | |3 there | 1 |0 available | ?
"|1 Also | |3 I | |5 am | |1 still | |4 thinking | about |6 the | |7 Matisse | |3 we | |4 discussed | |1 before | but as |3 you | |5 can | |4 see | , |3 I | |4 have | |6 a | |2 lot | of |0 other | |2 artists | |3 I | |5 am | |0 interested | in and |3 it | |5 may | |4 remain | on |6 the | |0 back | |2 burner | because |3 we | |1 already | |4 have | one ."

|4 Forget | |6 the | ONE or |0 more | |2 contract | |2 questions | .
|3 I | |4 see | |3 we | |4 expect | to |4 have | |0 separate | |2 contracts | for |6 each | |2 project | .
|3 I | |4 have | |6 a | |2 couple | of |2 questions | so |3 I | |5 can | |4 wrap | up |6 the | |2 LOI | :

"On |6 the | |2 issue | of |6 the | |2 contracts | , |6 the | |2 draft | |4 says | that |6 the | $ 170 m |5 is | |4 paid | |1 when | |6 the | |2 EPC | |2 contract | |5 is | |4 signed | ."
|5 Are | |3 we | |4 expecting | that |6 the | |2 portion | |0 attributable | to |6 each | |2 project | |5 will | |5 be | |4 paid | as |6 the | |0 individual | |2 EPC | |2 contracts | |5 are | |4 signed | ?
"|2 Thanks | ,"

"1 . |6 The | |2 pricing | |3 that | |3 we | |5 have | |4 given | |7 CRRA | |5 is | |0 specific | to |7 FuelCell | |7 Energy | and |5 would | not |5 be | |0 meaningful | without |4 listing | |6 the | |2 manufacturer | ( i.e. , |7 ONSI | |5 would | |5 be | |6 a | |2 lot | |0 more | |2 money | ) ."
"|1 Hence | , |3 I | |4 think | that |3 we | |4 have | to |4 reference | |6 the | |2 manufacturer | ."
2 . |6 The | |2 attachment | of |6 the | |2 Development | |2 Agreement | |5 is | |6 a | |7 Jeff | |2 question | .
"In |2 order | to |4 mark | |6 any | 2000 |2 income | , |3 we | |5 will | |4 need | to |4 get | |7 CRRA | to |4 execute | |6 the | |2 Development | |2 Agreement | in 2000 ."
"In |3 my | |2 opinion | , |3 we | |5 should | |4 show | |7 CRRA | |6 a | |2 copy | of |6 the | |2 LOI | with |6 the | |2 assumption | that |6 the | |2 Development | |2 Agreement | |5 is | |4 attached | ."
|3 I | |5 would | |1 actually | |4 send | |3 them | |6 the | |2 draft | |2 Development | |2 Agreement | |6 a | |2 couple | |2 days | after |6 the | |2 LOI | .
"|4 Based | on |1 how | |7 CRRA | |4 reacts | , |3 I | |5 would | |4 make | |6 an | |0 ultimate | |2 determination | if |6 the | |2 agreement | |4 needs | to |5 be | |4 attached | to |6 the | |2 LOI | ."
3 . |3 I | |4 expect | |1 at | |1 least | one |2 EPC | |2 contract | per |2 project | .
|3 We | |5 do | n't |4 want | to |4 condition | |6 the | |2 acceptance | of one |2 project | on |6 the | |2 performance | of |6 another | |2 project | .
|2 Performance | |2 tests | |5 will | either |5 be | |4 performed | on |6 a | |2 project | |2 basis | or |6 a | |2 unit | by |2 unit | |2 basis | in |6 a | |4 given | |2 project | .

"|3 I | |4 believe | that |3 these | |5 are | three |2 weekends | in |6 a | |2 row | , |7 January | 6 , 13 and |2 20th | ."

Hi ...
|4 Talked | to |6 the | |0 little | |2 mother | - |2 to | - |2 be | .

"|3 I | |4 think | that |3 it | |5 is | |6 a | |0 great | |2 idea | to |4 get | |6 some | |2 press | |4 regarding | |3 our | |0 fundamental | |2 operating | |2 standards | , but |3 I | |4 wonder | about |6 the | |1 most | |0 appropriate | |2 timing | , |0 enough | of |6 a | |0 global | |2 message | and |6 the | |2 means | of |2 delivery | ."
"On |6 the | |2 means | of |2 delivery | , |3 I | |5 am | not |0 sure | from |3 your | |2 note | whether or |1 not | |3 I | |1 fully | |4 understand | |6 the | |2 intent | ."
"|4 Is | |3 there | |6 an | |2 article | to |5 be | |4 included | in |6 an | |7 Enron | |2 publication | and in |2 addition | |4 is | |6 a | |2 letter | to |5 be | |4 sent | under |7 John | 's |2 name | ( if |1 so | , to |3 whom | |5 will | |6 the | |2 letter | |5 be | |4 sent | ) ?"
Or |5 is | |6 the | |2 letter | from |7 John | |6 an | |2 introduction | to |5 be | |4 included | as |6 a | |2 lead | |2 in | to |6 the | |2 article | ?
"With |2 regard | to |6 a | |0 global | |2 message | , |3 I | |4 think | that one of |6 the | |0 key | |2 points | around |0 fundamental | |2 operating | |2 standards | |4 are | that |3 they | |5 are | |4 intended | to |5 be | |0 global | in |2 nature | , |4 applied | to |6 every | |2 commodity | and |6 every | |2 location | |1 where | |3 we | |4 engage | in |2 trading | |2 activities | ."
"With |6 these | |2 operating | |2 standards | |4 implemented | |1 worldwide | , |3 we | |5 will | |4 know | as |2 operations | |2 professionals | that |2 risk | |5 is | |5 being | |4 mitigated | and |3 we | |5 will | |5 be | |0 able | to |4 ensure | |7 Enron | |2 top | |2 management | that |3 there | |4 is | |2 consistency | in |2 operating | |2 standards | |1 worldwide | ."
"|6 These | |0 global | |2 standards | |1 also | |5 should | |4 enable | |7 Enron | to |4 expand | |3 its | |2 business | |2 reach | |1 more | |1 quickly | , with |1 well | |4 defined | |2 requirements | with |2 regard | to |2 trading | |2 operations | ."
|3 I | |5 am | not |0 sure | from |6 the | |2 article | as |4 written | that |6 the | |0 global | |2 nature | of |6 this | |2 effort | |4 comes | |1 across | .
"|1 Finally | , |6 a | |2 question | |4 regarding | |2 timing | ."
|6 The | |0 last | |3 I | |4 knew | after |3 you | and |7 Brent | |4 drafted | |6 this | |2 starting | |2 point | for |0 fundamental | |2 operating | |2 standards | |4 was | that |3 this | |5 was | |5 being | |4 circulated | ( |7 Shona | |4 took | |3 this | to |4 do | after |7 Brent | 's |2 return | to |7 Houston | ) for |2 comments | to |6 all | |2 business | |2 controllers | .
"|3 I | |5 do | n't |4 believe | that |3 we | |5 are | |1 quite | at |6 the | |2 point | |1 that | |3 we | |5 can | |4 say | that |6 all | |2 business | |2 controllers | |1 worldwide | |5 have | |4 reviewed | , |4 understand | and |5 have | |4 implemented | |6 these | |2 standards | ."
"And |1 not | to |4 belittle | |6 the | |2 process | of |4 creating | |6 the | |2 standards | , |6 the | |0 tough | |2 part | ( and |6 the | |0 real | |2 meat | behind |3 this | ) |5 will | |5 be | |6 an | |0 effective | |2 exception | |2 report | on |6 a | |0 global | |2 basis | against |6 these | |2 standards | ."
|3 My | |2 commitment | to |7 Rick | |7 Causey | |5 is | that |3 I | |5 will | |4 have | |6 that | |0 global | |2 report | in |2 production | by |6 the | |2 end | of |6 the | |2 year | .
|3 There | |4 is | |0 much | |2 work | to |4 do | in |4 defining | |6 the | |2 content | and |2 regularity | of |6 the | |2 report | and |1 even | |0 more | |2 work | to |4 do | to |4 identify | |0 reliable | |2 sources | of |2 data | for |4 compiling | |6 the | |2 report | .
"|7 Shona | |5 has | |4 commissioned | |7 Mike | |7 Moscoso | to |4 work | on |3 this | , and |3 I | |4 believe | that |7 Mike | |5 has | |1 already | |5 been | |4 working | with |7 James | |7 New | ."
|1 So | |3 I | |4 question | whether or |1 not | |3 you | |4 want | to |4 publish | |2 info | about |0 fundamental | |2 standards | |3 that | |3 we | |5 can | not |1 yet | |4 report | against .
|5 Would | |6 a | |1 more | |0 appropriate | |2 time | |5 be | after |6 the | |7 Global | |7 Operations | |7 Controller | |2 meeting | in |7 October | |1 when | |3 we | |5 should | |4 have | |0 worldwide | |2 buy | - |2 in | and |2 commitment | to |6 these | |2 standards | and ( |1 hopefully | ) |3 our | |0 first | |2 draft | of |6 a | |0 meaningful | |2 exception | |2 report | ?
|0 Sorry | that |6 this | |2 response | |4 looks | |1 so | |0 long | .
"|3 I | |5 have | |5 been | |4 interrupted | 20 |2 times | while |4 responding | , |1 so | |3 I | |4 hope | that |3 it | |4 makes | |2 sense | ."
|2 Thanks | for |4 sharing | |3 this | with |3 me | .
"Since |3 you | |4 asked | for |2 input | , |3 I | |4 hope | that |3 you | |5 do | n't |4 mind | that |3 I | |4 gave | |3 you | |6 some | ."

"At |6 this | |2 point | , |3 our | |2 IT | |2 contacts | |5 are | |4 backpedalling | |6 a | |2 bit | and |4 suggesting | |3 they | |5 can | |4 overcome | |6 the | |2 TIBCO | and |2 Terminal | |2 Server | |2 problems | ."
"|3 There | |4 are | |1 still | four |0 important | |2 issues | , |1 however | :"
|2 IT | |1 still | |5 can | not |4 commit | to |4 transferring | |2 messages | across |2 domains | .
|3 This | |4 means | that |2 messages | |4 initiated | at |7 Corp | and |4 intended | for |6 the | |0 entire | |7 Enron | |2 organization | |5 will | not |4 reach | |6 any | |2 business | |2 units | outside |6 the | |7 Corp | |2 domain | .
"|6 No | |2 messages | |5 will | |4 reach | |6 the | |7 EES | |2 organization | unless |7 IBM | |4 agrees | |1 not | to |4 use | |3 their | |0 proprietary | |2 message | |2 delivery | |2 tool | , |7 WebSphere | , and |5 will | |4 use | |7 WebLogic | |1 instead | ."
"|7 WebLogic | |5 is | |4 required | by |7 BackWeb | , although |3 it | |5 is | |4 designed | by |6 a | |0 separate | |2 company | ."
"|2 HR | , |4 intended | to |5 be | |6 a | |0 key | |2 user | of |6 this | |2 tool | , |5 will | not |4 use | |7 BackWeb | because |2 survey | |2 responses | |5 can | not |5 be | |4 made | |0 anonymous | ."
|2 HR | |5 has | |1 already | |4 purchased | |6 a | |2 tool | |4 called | |7 CONFIRMIT | |3 that | |5 can | |4 execute | |0 anonymous | |2 surveys | .
"|2 Messages | |5 will | not |5 be | |4 delivered | |1 simultaneously | to |6 all | |2 users | in |6 the | |0 same | |2 domain | , nor |5 will | |3 they | |5 be | |4 delivered | for two to five |2 hours | after |3 they | |5 are | |4 sent | by |6 the | |2 message | |2 administrator | ."
"|6 Another | |2 thing | to |4 consider | |4 is | that |6 these | |2 messages | |5 will | |5 be | |0 set | to |4 expire | and |4 disappear | within |6 a | |4 set | |2 period | of |2 time | , |4 meaning | |2 users | |5 can | not |4 retrieve | |3 them | and |4 read | |3 them | |1 later | ( as |3 they | |5 can | with |2 e-mail | ) ."
"|3 This | |4 means | that |3 I | |5 could | |5 be | |1 away | from |6 the | |2 office | for |0 several | |2 days | and |4 miss | |6 a | |2 message | |1 entirely | , because |3 it | |5 would | |5 have | |4 expired | and |4 disappeared | by |6 the | |2 time | |3 I | |4 returned | ."
"|6 The | |0 plain | |2 fact | |4 is | that |6 a | |0 few | |2 members | of |2 IT | |5 are | |4 pushing | |6 this | |2 initiative | , but |3 they | |4 lack | |0 commercial | |2 sponsorship | ."
|3 They | |5 are | |4 hoping | |7 Corp | |5 will | |4 foot | |6 the | |2 bill | for |6 a | |2 pilot | |3 which | |5 will | |4 allow | |3 them | to |1 fully | |4 test | |6 this | |2 tool | before |4 implementing | |3 it | |2 company | - |1 wide | .

|3 It | |5 was | |0 good | to |4 hear | from |3 you | !
|3 We | |4 had | |6 a | |0 nice | |7 Thanksgiving | |1 here | |1 too | .
"|3 It | |5 's | |0 funny | , because |1 usually | |3 it | |5 's | |1 just | |3 me | , |2 Mom | , |7 Craig | and |7 Danelia | , and |7 Danelia | |5 does | n't |1 really | |4 like | |4 roasted | |2 turkey | or |0 roast | |2 beef | ( not that |3 she | |5 would | |4 say | |3 it | to |3 me | ! ) , |1 so | |3 there | |4 is | not |1 just | |6 the | |0 same | |2 joy | in |2 cooking | |3 it | |5 would | |5 be | |1 elsewise | ."
|3 It | |5 was | |0 good | |4 having | |6 the | |2 girls | |1 down | .
"|3 We | |4 played | |6 a | |0 new | |2 version | of |7 Uno | |4 called | "" |0 African | |7 Uno | "" |3 that | |5 was | |0 complex | , |0 fast | and at |2 times | , |1 physically | |0 challenging | ."
|3 It | |5 's | not for |6 the | |0 meek | .
|3 It | |5 was | |0 incredible | |6 what | |6 a | |0 good | |2 player | |7 Alena | |5 was | .
|3 She | |4 had | |3 her | |2 cards | |4 memorized | |1 as | |1 well | as |3 everyone | |0 else | s ( |1 when | |3 you | |4 play | |3 you | |5 'll | |4 see | |1 why | |3 you | |5 can | |4 know | |3 everyone | |0 else | s |2 hands | ! ) .
|3 I | |4 expect | |7 Craig | |5 did | n't |4 want | |2 Mom | to |4 see | |3 his | |2 place | because |3 it | |5 was | |0 messy | .
"|3 I | |4 think | |4 compared | to |3 my | |2 house | , |3 he | |5 's | |0 embarrased | about |3 his | |2 apartment | ."
"|1 Then | , |1 also | , |3 he | |5 's | |4 got | |1 so | |0 much | |2 stuff | in |1 there | |1 right | |1 now | , that |3 I | |5 do | n't |4 know | |1 how | |3 he | |5 's | |4 going | to |4 fit | |2 baby | |2 stuff | ."
|3 They | |5 would | |1 only | |4 give | |3 him | |6 a | 6 |2 month | |2 lease | |1 when | |3 he | |4 renewed | |3 his | |2 lease | |0 last | |2 month | because |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 want | 3 |2 people | in |6 that | |0 small | |2 apartment | .
|1 So | |3 he | |5 's | |4 going | to |4 have | to |4 start | |4 looking | for |6 another | |2 place | .
And |3 his | |2 apartment | |5 is | |1 so | |0 run | down down |3 I | |5 'm | |0 afraid | |2 roaches | |5 might | |5 be | |4 crawling | over |6 the | |2 baby | .
|3 I | |4 guess | |2 Mom | |5 is | |4 going | to |4 come | |1 back | |1 down | |1 sometime | in |7 March | or |7 April | to |4 see | |6 the | |0 new | |2 baby | .
|3 You | |5 'll | |4 have | to |4 come | |4 visit | to |4 check | out |3 my | |0 new | |2 house | .
"|6 The | |0 upstairs | "" |2 guest | |2 suite | "" |5 is | |1 pretty | |0 neat | ."
"|3 It | |5 's | |4 got | |3 its | |0 own | |2 bathroom | and |2 tv | , and |5 is | |1 pretty | |0 cozy | ."
"|1 As | |1 far | as |6 the | |2 call | with |2 Uncle | |7 Ben | |4 goes | , if |3 he | |5 was | |0 thrilled | to |4 hear | from |3 me | |3 I | |5 could | n't |4 tell | by |3 his | |2 voice | ."
|3 It | |5 was | |6 a | |1 pretty | |0 stilted | |2 conversation | for |6 both | of |3 us | .
"But , |3 I | |4 guess | , |3 it | |5 's | |6 a | |2 start | ..."
|3 I | |5 've | |1 already | |4 made | |3 my | |7 XMAS | |2 plans | .

|1 How | |5 was | |6 the | |2 play | ?
|3 I | |4 forgot | to |4 tell | |3 you | that |3 I | |4 saw | |3 your | |2 friend | on |6 a | |2 re-run | |7 Jeopardy | |6 the | |0 other | |2 night | and |3 I | |1 almost | |4 called | |3 you | but |3 it | |4 came | |1 on | at 11:30 .
|0 Smart | |2 girl | .
|3 I | |4 ran | into |7 Corey | |0 last | |2 night | at |7 LW | s and |3 I | |5 am | |4 thinking | |3 this | |5 is | |6 a | |2 girl | for |7 Darren | .
"|1 Anyway | , |2 lots | of |0 fun | |2 meetings | |2 today | ."
|3 I | |5 'll | |4 talk | to |3 you | |1 later | .
|1 Maybe | |3 you | |5 should | |4 ignore | |6 the | |2 sentiment | of |6 the | |2 quote | |3 I | |4 sent | |1 earlier | ...
|3 I | |4 think | |3 you | |5 may | |5 be | |4 adhering | to |3 it | |1 too | |1 faithfully | .
At |6 this | |2 rate | |3 we | |5 may | |4 have | to |4 start | |4 pinning | |2 notes | to |3 your | |2 shirt | to |4 remind | |3 you | to |4 do | |2 things | .
"|1 However | , |5 having | |4 driven | with |3 you | on |0 several | |2 occasions | |3 I | |4 feel | |0 confident | |3 you | |5 will | |5 be | |0 able | to |4 pass | |6 the | |2 test | with |4 flying | |2 colors | ."
"|4 Keep | in |2 mind | |1 though | that if |3 you | |4 end | up |4 failing | |3 I | |5 will | not |4 let | |3 you | |4 forget | |3 it | ( and , as |3 we | |5 have | |4 established | , |3 I | |4 have | |6 the | |2 memory | of |6 an | |2 elephant | ) ."
|3 I | |5 'll | |4 keep | |2 discussion | of |3 me | to |6 a | |2 minimum | and |1 just | |4 say | that |2 things | |5 are | |0 well | on 32 .
|1 Now | |1 back | to |3 what | |5 's | |1 really | |0 important | ... |3 you | .
|4 Thought | |3 you | |5 'd | |4 like | to |4 know | that |6 the | |7 Dixie | |7 Chicks | |5 are | |4 coming | |1 back | to |7 Houston | |7 Dec. | 12 and |5 will | |4 performing | |1 just | down |6 the | |2 street | from |3 you | at |6 the | |7 Compaq | |7 Center | ... |3 it | |5 's | |1 all | about |3 you | and |3 your | |2 needs | .

|5 Would | |3 you | please |4 contact | |7 Gerald | |7 Nemec | and |4 review | |6 the | |7 Gallup | |7 Compression | |7 Service | |7 Contract | in |2 respect | to |6 the | |2 Load | |2 Control | |2 Management | .
|3 My | |2 understanding | |4 was | that |7 ECS | |4 was | to |4 provide | |6 a | |2 means | to |4 access | |7 CDEC | 's |0 online | |2 profile | in |2 order | for |3 us | to |4 make | |6 a | |2 decision | to |4 avoid | |4 running | |6 the | |2 compressor | during |7 CDEC | 's |2 peak | |2 load | |2 periods | .
"|3 We | |5 have | not |4 received | |2 access | to |6 this | |2 information | |3 which | |5 has | |4 resulted | |1 so | |1 far | in |0 additional | |0 electric | |2 cost | of $ 200,987.33 for |6 the | |2 period | of |7 July | through |7 September | ."
"|0 Additional | |2 cost | |5 will | |5 be | |4 incurred | for |6 the | |2 remainder | of |6 this | |2 year | , |3 that | |3 I | |5 have | not |5 been | |0 able | to |4 review | |1 yet | ."
"|6 This | |2 cost | |5 is | |4 averaging | $ 79,000 per |2 month | if |3 we | |4 continue | to |4 run | |6 the | |2 compressor | as |3 we | |5 have | in |7 August | and |7 September | ."
"|0 Good | |2 point | , but |3 I | |5 'm | |0 comfortable | |3 we | |5 're | |4 covered | because |3 our | |2 bidders | |5 were | |1 all | |4 bidding | on |6 a | |2 chunk | of |2 capacity | and |0 primary | |2 points | ."
"|3 They | |5 are | |4 deemed | to |5 be | on |2 notice | that |3 they | |4 had | |0 alternate | |2 point | |2 rights | ( |3 it | |5 s | in |6 the | |2 tariff | ) and if |3 they | |4 wanted | to |4 submit | |6 a | |2 bid | |3 that | |4 had | |6 a | |0 different | |2 rate | for |2 primaries | and |2 alternates | , |3 they | |5 could | |5 have | |4 done | |1 so | ."
"|2 None | of |3 them | |4 did | , and |1 most | |1 importantly | , |6 the | |4 winning | |2 bidders | |4 did | not ."
|3 Our | |2 letter | |2 agreement | |1 simply | |4 memorializes | that |3 we | |5 will | |4 charge | |6 the | |0 same | |4 negotiated | |2 rate | whether |6 the | |2 gas | |4 flows | on |2 primaries | or |2 alternates | .
|3 I | |4 assume | from |3 your | |2 message | |3 you | |5 are | |0 OK | with |3 this | and |3 they | |5 can | |4 get | |3 it | |4 nailed | |1 down | ?
|7 DF |
|3 I | |1 just | |5 got | |4 done | |4 looking | at |6 the | |0 underlying | |2 contract | |2 language | as |4 set | |1 forth | in |6 the | pro forma |2 service | |2 agreement | in |6 the | |2 tariff | and |3 it | |1 specifically | |4 says | that |6 the | |0 max | |2 rate | |5 would | |4 apply | unless |6 a | |2 discount | or |4 negotiated | |2 rate | |5 has | |5 been | |4 agreed | to .
"|3 My | |2 concern | with |4 adding | |6 the | |2 language | |1 below | |4 is | , |5 could | |3 it | |5 be | |4 argued | that |1 not | |3 everyone | |4 knew | |6 the | |2 rate | |5 would | or |5 could | |4 apply | at |6 any | |2 point | , since |3 we | |1 just | |4 stated | |7 Topack | and |7 Needles | and if |3 they | |4 knew | |3 they | |5 might | |5 have | |4 bid | |6 a | |0 different | |2 rate | ??"

"If |7 Sam | 's |2 description | |1 below | of |6 the | |2 GCP | |2 procedure | |5 is | |0 correct | , |3 it | |4 looks | to |3 me | like |3 something | |4 needs | to |5 be | |4 changed | ."
|6 The | |2 difficulty | |4 lies | in |6 the | |2 fact | that |6 the | |2 confirmation | |2 system | |4 reads | |6 the | |2 counterparty | 's |2 name | from |0 Global | |2 Counterparty | .
Since |2 divisions | of |2 companies | |5 are | not |0 legal | |2 entities | |3 they | |5 do | not |4 have | |6 the | |2 power | to |4 contract | in |3 their | |0 own | |2 names | .
"If |6 the | |0 correct | |0 legal | |2 name | |5 is | not in |0 Global | |2 Counterparty | , |6 the | |2 confirmation | |4 goes | |1 out | with |6 the | |0 wrong | |0 legal | |2 name | on |3 it | |1 seriously | |4 compromising | |6 the | |2 contract | |3 itself | ."
|3 That | |5 is | |6 the | |2 source | of |7 Tana | 's |2 concern | |4 regarding | |6 the | |0 correct | |2 entering | of |2 divisions | in |6 the | |2 system | .
|3 My | |2 suggestion | |4 is | that |0 Global | |2 Counterparty | |4 use | |6 the | |0 same | |2 name | |3 that | |6 the | |2 customer | |5 has | |4 signed | on |6 the | |7 EnronOnline | |2 Password | |2 Application | -- |3 my | |2 understanding | |4 is | that |6 the | |7 EnronOnline | |2 team | |4 returns | |0 inappropriate | |2 Applications | to |6 the | |2 customer | until |3 they | |5 are | |1 correctly | |4 completed | .
In |6 this | |0 particular | |2 case | since |6 the | |2 counterparty | |5 is | |1 still | not |4 allowed | to |4 transact | on |7 EnronOnline | |1 almost | |6 a | |2 month | after |4 sending | |1 in | |3 their | |2 application | |3 they | |5 are | |1 understandably | |0 upset | and |5 are | |1 now | |4 complaining | .
"|3 I | |5 would | |4 appreciate | |3 it | if |3 you | |5 could | |4 get | |6 this | |2 one | |4 fixed | |2 today | and , if |3 you | |4 have | |6 any | |2 problem | with |4 changing | |6 the | |2 GCP | |2 procedure | , please |4 let | |3 me | |4 know | ."

"As |6 an | |2 overview | , |6 this | |2 proposal | : * |4 Maintains | |6 the | |0 basic | |2 Gas | |2 Accord | |2 structure | in |2 place | |2 today | for |6 the | |2 period | 2003 to 2007 . *"

"|1 instead | of |4 suggesting | |6 a | |0 specific | |2 rate | |2 increase | - 10 or 15 % , |3 I | |4 think | |3 we | |5 should | |4 acknowledge | that |6 a | "" |0 modest | "" |2 increase | |5 may | |5 be | |0 necessary | and |5 may | in |2 fact | |5 be | |0 desirable | - but that |6 the | |0 specific | |2 amount | of |2 increase | |5 should | |4 be | |0 reasoned | and |0 subject | to |1 well | |4 thought | out |2 evidence | and |2 hearings | , not |1 just | |4 determined | by |2 whim | ."
"In |0 general | , |3 we | |5 should | not |5 be | |1 overly | |0 prescriptive | at |6 this | |2 point | and |3 I | |4 know | |3 you | |4 agree | with |3 that | ."
"|1 Otherwise | , |3 I | |4 think | |3 you | |5 have | |4 captured | |6 the | |2 points | |1 excellently | ."
|3 We | |5 're | in |6 the | |2 process | of |4 developing | |6 a | |2 strategy | to |4 take | |3 us | through |6 the | |0 next | |0 few | |2 months | .
"But while |6 the | ( |1 otherwise | |0 perishable | ) |2 thoughts | |5 are | |1 still | |0 fresh | in |3 my | |2 mind | from |6 the | |2 hearings | on |7 Monday | and |7 Tuesday | , |3 I | |4 wanted | to |4 throw | |1 out | |6 some | |2 observations | for |2 discussion | in |6 the | |2 days | / |2 weeks | |1 ahead | ."
"|2 OBSERVATION | -- |6 The | |2 pressure | to |4 finger | |3 somebody | for "" |2 price | |2 gouging | "" |5 is | |4 increasing | ."
"|6 The | |2 administration | |5 is | |2 hell | |0 bent | on |4 finding | |6 a | "" |2 fall | |2 guy | . """
|6 The | |2 price | |2 spikes | |4 pose | |0 real | |0 political | |2 risks | for |7 Davis | and |3 he | and |3 his | |2 folks | |4 need | and |4 want | |6 an | |0 easy | |2 way | |1 out | .
"|3 His | |2 press | |2 release | |4 following | |6 the | |2 hearing | |4 renewed | |6 the | |2 call | for "" |2 refunds | . """
"On |3 my | |2 panel | , |7 Loretta | |7 Lynch | |4 asked | |7 Reliant | and |7 Duke | to |4 supply | |3 her | with |6 the | |2 details | of |6 the | |2 contracts | |3 they | |4 cut | to |4 sell | |3 their | |2 power | |1 forward | to |2 marketers | ."
And |7 Carl | |7 Wood | 's |2 remarks | |5 were | |0 extreme | .
"At |6 the | |7 Barton | |2 hearing | , |6 a | |0 liberal | |7 democrat | ( |7 Filner | ) and |6 a | |0 conservative | |7 Republican | ( |7 Hunter | ) |4 locked | |2 arms | in |4 calling | for |2 refunds | ."

|7 Wolak | |4 said | |1 somewhat | |1 emphatically | that |6 the | |2 nature | of |7 California | 's |2 market | |2 structure | |4 makes | |3 it | |0 impossible | to |4 single | out |6 a | |0 single | |2 participant | as |6 the | |2 culprit | .

|2 IMPLICATION | -- |3 It | |4 seems | |0 prudent | for |7 Enron | to |4 understand | |1 better | |3 its | |2 risks | of |5 getting | |4 fingered | .

"|7 Tom | |7 Byargeon | , |7 Kevin | |7 Miller | and |7 Ken | |7 Loch | in |7 ENA | |5 are | |4 working | with |2 producers | in |6 the | |7 US | |0 involved | in |0 deep | |2 water | |0 offshore | |7 Louisiana | / |7 Texas | |2 oil | and |2 gas | |2 drilling | |2 projects | ."
|6 This | |2 financing | |2 activity | |5 was | |1 primarily | |4 started | to |4 help | |7 ENA | |4 secure | |0 long | |2 term | |2 well | |2 head | and |2 pipeline | |0 natural | |2 gas | |2 supplies | to |4 supplement | |6 the | |2 gas | |2 trading | |2 desk | |2 activities | .
|1 Just | like |3 what | |4 happened | in |7 Enron | 's |0 initial | |2 VPP | |2 program | |3 they | |5 are | |4 find | |0 more | |2 interest | in |2 oil | |2 drilling | |2 projects | |1 rather | than |0 natural | |2 gas | |2 projects | .
"|3 They | |5 are | |1 currently | |4 working | on |6 a | |2 bid | ( |0 due | 1/31 ) for |6 the | |7 Medusa | |2 project | |3 which | |4 involves | |7 Murphy | ( |2 operator | ) , |7 Agip | and |7 Callon | in |7 Mississippi | |7 Canyon | |7 Blocks | |2 # | 538 and |2 # | 582 ."
"|6 The | |0 initial | |2 reservoir | |2 reports | |4 estimate | |2 reserves | of 80 - 120 million |2 barrels | of |0 sour | |2 crude | and |3 they | |4 estimate | |0 initial | |2 production | to |5 be | 40,000 |2 bpd | |4 starting | in |2 1Q | 2003 ."
|2 Quality | |5 is | |4 estimated | to |5 be | |6 a | |7 Mars | |2 type | |2 crude | with 25 - 27 |2 API | |2 Gravity | and 1.5 - 2.0 % |2 sulfur | .
|2 Plans | |4 are | to |4 build | |6 a | |0 private | |2 pipeline | to |7 Equilon | 's |7 West | |7 Delta | |2 # | 143 |2 platform | and |1 then | |4 bring | |6 the | |2 oil | |1 onshore | .

|3 these | |5 are | |0 short | |2 term | |2 transactions | and |4 requiring | |6 this | |2 documentation | |5 will | |4 cause | |3 us | to |4 lose | |2 business | because |0 competitive | |2 alternatives | |5 do | not |4 have | |0 such | |0 burdensome | |2 requirements | .
"|6 the | |0 primary | |2 reason | |3 we | |4 need | |6 these | |2 things | |5 is | for |6 the | |2 scenario | |1 where | |6 a | |2 muni | |4 does | |6 a | |2 derivative | |2 deal | with |6 an | |0 open | - |0 ended | |2 downside | , |4 loses | $ 50 million , and |1 then | |4 claims | that |3 it | |5 was | not |6 a | |0 valid | |2 contract | ."
"in |3 our | |2 case | , |3 they | |5 are | |1 only | |4 hedging | ."
|3 we | |5 are | |4 collecting | |6 a | |2 premium | up |2 front | and |3 their | |0 total | |2 cost | |5 is | |4 known | up |2 front | .
|1 therefore | |3 they | |5 will | not |4 attempt | to |4 make | |6 this | |2 claim | .
"|1 even | if |3 they | |4 did | , |3 our | |2 risk | |5 is | |4 limited | to |6 the | |2 premium | , |1 not | |6 some | |0 big | |2 payout | ."
|6 the | |2 risk | of |4 losing | |2 business | |5 is | |1 far | |0 greater | than |6 the | |2 risk | of |6 a | |2 counterparty | |4 trying | to |4 get | |3 their | |2 premium | back .
|4 seems | like |6 a | 5 |2 second | |2 decision | to |3 me | .
|5 is | |3 it | |0 possible | to |4 combine | |6 the | |0 standard | |2 isda | and |3 our | |2 confirm | into |6 a | |0 single | |0 long | |2 form | ?
by |4 going | |1 away | from |6 the | |0 standard | |2 isda | |1 maybe | |3 we | |5 can | |4 eliminate | |6 these | |2 requirements | because |6 the | |2 payout | |2 liability | |5 is | |1 only | 1 - |2 way | .

|7 Carol | :
|3 I | |5 have | |4 attempted | to |4 incorporate | |6 the | |2 changes | |3 that | |7 Jim | |5 has | |4 incorporated | in |3 our | |0 long | |2 form | |2 power | |2 agreement | |3 which | |7 ENA | |5 has | |4 suggested | to |2 date | into |6 the | |0 short | |2 form | .
|4 Attached | please |4 find | |6 a | |2 sample | |0 short | |2 form | ( for |6 the | |2 Con | |2 Ed | |2 market | ) for |3 your | |2 review | .
Please |4 note | |6 the | |4 following | as |3 you | |4 review | :
1 . |6 The | |0 short | |2 forms | |5 do | not |4 contain | |6 the | |2 optionality | |4 relating | to |3 our | |4 performing | |2 billing | |2 services | -- |6 all | of |3 our | |0 midmarket | |2 forms | |4 anticipate | that |3 we | |5 will | |4 act | as |2 customer | 's |2 billing | |2 agent | and that |3 we | |5 will | |4 collect | |6 all | |2 amounts | |0 due | |0 related | to |2 T&D | and |6 the | |0 like | from |6 the | |2 customer | ( and |4 reflect | |0 same | on |3 our | |2 invoice | ) and |4 pass | |6 those | |2 amounts | |1 on | to |6 the | |2 customer | 's |2 utility | .
"2 . |3 I | |5 did | not |4 include | |6 a | "" |2 Setoff | "" |2 provision | in |6 this | |2 draft | , |1 mainly | because |6 the | |0 vast | |2 majority | of |6 the | |2 time | , |3 we | |5 will | not , nor |5 will | |6 an | |2 affiliate | , |4 have | |6 another | |2 agreement | in |2 place | with |6 these | |2 customers | ."
"If |3 you | |4 feel | |1 strongly | about |3 our | |4 including | |6 a | |2 setoff | |2 provision | , |3 we | |5 will | |4 do | |1 so | ."
3 . |6 The | |2 change | in |2 law | |2 provision | |4 reads | |6 a | |2 bit | |1 differently | from |6 the | |0 long | |2 form | -- |6 the | |2 thinking | |1 here | |4 is | that |6 the | |0 long | |2 form | |2 language | |5 is | |1 very | |0 lengthy | and |1 rather | |0 harsh | ( and |3 we | |5 've | |4 had | |0 great | |2 difficulty | |4 selling | |3 it | in |6 the | |2 past | ) .
"|4 Taking | into |2 consideration | |6 this | |2 class | of |2 customer | , |3 we | |4 decided | to |4 include | |0 certain | |2 items | , |4 including | |3 our | |2 inability | to |4 cover | |3 our | |2 costs | due to |6 a | |2 change | in |2 law | , |2 rules | or |2 practices | as |6 a | "" |2 force | |2 majeure | |2 event | "" in |6 an | |2 effort | to |4 soften | |6 the | |2 approach | ( |4 see | |6 the | |2 GTCs | ) ."
"|1 Also | |3 we | |5 do | not |4 address | |2 calculation | of |6 a | |2 termination | |2 payment | in |6 the | |2 event | of |6 a | |2 change | in |2 law | as |6 the | |0 long | |2 form | |4 does | -- |1 again | , |1 more | in |6 the | |2 interest | of "" |4 saving | |2 space | "" than |3 anything | |0 else | ..."
|4 Let | |3 us | |4 know | |3 your | |2 thoughts | on |6 this | |2 document | and if |3 you | |5 are | |0 comfortable | with |3 our | |4 using | |3 this | until |0 such | |2 time | as |6 the | |2 hybrid | |2 form | |5 is | |4 launched | .
"If |3 you | |5 are | |0 comfortable | , |3 we | |5 will | |4 drive | |6 these | |2 changes | into |3 our | |0 other | |0 midmarket | |2 power | |2 forms | ."
"|2 Thanks | |1 again | for |3 your | |2 help | with |6 this | |2 project | ,"

|3 It | |4 looks | like |7 NASA | |5 is | |0 ready | to |4 sour | |1 again | after |3 it's | |0 devastating | |2 loss | from |6 the | |7 Columbia | |2 accident | |3 which | |4 occurred | |1 nearly | two |2 years | |1 ago | .

|3 I | |4 hope | |1 so | .
"|4 Seeing | |6 another | "" |7 Columbia | "" |2 incident | |5 can | |5 be | |1 quite | |0 frightening | ( |3 I | |4 woke | up to |3 it | |1 early | in |6 the | |2 morning | |1 when | |3 I | |5 was | in |7 Texas | ) ."

But |2 supporters | |5 are | |4 pointing | |6 a | |0 few | |0 good | |2 things | out :
"|1 Clearly | , |6 the | |2 agency | |5 has | |4 worked | |1 hard | at |4 tackling | |6 the | |0 technical | |2 challenges | |4 posed | by |6 a | |0 superb | and |1 surprisingly | |0 independent | - |0 minded | |0 investigative | |2 panel | ."
"|6 A | |0 few | |2 weeks | |1 ago | , |2 shuttle | |2 workers | at |6 the | |7 Kennedy | |7 Space | |7 Center | |4 received | |6 a | |2 rocket | - |0 like | |2 boost | in |2 morale | with two |0 important | |2 deliveries | for |6 the | |0 next | |2 shuttle | to |4 carry | ."
|3 One | |5 is | |6 a | |0 special | |2 tool | to |4 detect | |2 damage | to |6 the | |0 thermal | - |0 protective | |2 tile | while in |2 orbit | - |3 something | |6 the | |7 Columbia | |2 crew | |5 would | |5 have | |4 welcomed | .
"|6 The | |0 other | |5 is | |6 a | |0 new | |2 fuel | |2 tank | "" |4 guaranteed | "" by |7 NASA | not to |4 shed | |1 potentially | |0 fatal | |2 hunks | of |2 insulation | ."
|7 NASA | |4 has | |6 some | |2 PR | |2 hurdles | to |4 overcome | in |6 the | |2 future | .
But |4 let | |3 s | |4 hope | for |3 their | |2 sake | ( and |6 the | |2 sake | of |6 all | |2 space | |2 lovers | |1 out | |1 there | ) that |3 they | |5 can | |4 redefine | |3 their | |2 image | and |4 rekindle | |6 the | |2 hope | of |2 space | |2 colonization | |1 again | .

|3 I | |4 see | |6 the | |2 merit | in |4 flowing | with |2 duality | .
"One of |3 my | |1 most | |4 cherished | |2 dualities | |5 is | |6 the | |2 understanding | that |3 we | |5 are | |1 both | |0 autonomous | |2 individuals | with |6 the | |2 power | to |4 shape | |3 our | |0 personal | |2 destinies | and at |6 the | |0 same | |2 time | |3 we | |5 are | |1 all | one , that |3 there | |4 is | |6 no | |2 separation | between |3 you | and |3 I | , |3 we | |5 are | |1 all | |1 together | in |6 this | |2 thing | |4 called | |2 life | , |3 we | |0 human | |2 beings | , |6 the | |2 birds | and |6 the | |2 tress | , |6 the | |2 rocks | and |6 the | |2 sky | , |6 all | of |3 it | ."

"|1 No | |1 matter | |6 what | |2 progress | |3 we | |4 make | as |2 individuals | in |4 becoming | |0 healthier | , |3 we | |5 will | |1 never | |4 achieve | |0 real | |2 health | until |3 we | |1 collectively | |4 decide | to |4 create | |6 a | |0 healthier | |2 reality | ."
|1 Fortunately | |2 circumstances | |5 will | |4 force | |3 our | |2 hand | |1 soon | since |3 our | |0 collective | |0 bad | |2 behaviour | |5 can | not |4 continue | |1 indefinitely | .
In |6 the | |0 near | |2 future | |0 collective | |2 choices | |5 will | |4 need | to |5 be | |4 made | .
|5 Will | |3 we | |4 choose | to |4 live | in |2 harmony | with |6 this | |2 planet | or |4 crash | and |4 burn | in |6 a | |2 conflagration | of |2 arrogance | and |2 disregard | ?
|5 Will | |3 we | |4 choose | to |4 rise | about |2 prejudice | and |2 intolerance | or |4 go | |1 down | |4 kicking | and |4 screaming | with |4 holding | on to |2 fear | and |2 anger | ?

"|1 Whereas | , |4 trying | to |4 translate | and |4 grapple | with |0 wordy | |2 meanings | |5 is | |6 an | |0 intellectual | |2 mechanism | - |6 an | |0 analytical | |2 process | ."

|6 The | |0 important | |2 point | |4 is | to |4 develop | |6 some | |0 psycho-spiritual | |2 connection | between |3 your | |2 mind | and |6 the | |0 universal | |2 Consciousness | or |0 Supreme | |2 Consciousness | .
|5 Do | n't |4 worry | if |3 you | |4 have | |2 trouble | |4 concentrating | on |6 the | |2 mantra | and |2 ideation | - |3 that | |5 's | |0 normal | .
|3 It | |4 takes | |6 some | |2 time | and |2 practice | to |5 be | |0 able | to |4 focus | on |6 the | one |2 thought | .

"As |0 many | of |3 you | |5 may | |5 have | |4 heard | , |7 President | |7 Bush | |5 has | |4 nominated | |6 a | |0 long | - |2 time | |0 Federal | |2 Judge | |4 named | |7 Samuel | |7 Alito | to |4 become | |6 the | |0 next | |2 member | of |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | |7 Supreme | |7 Court | , to |4 fill | |6 a | |2 vacancy | |4 created | by |6 the | |2 retirement | of |6 another | |2 member | of |6 the | |2 Court | ."
"Under |3 our | |2 Constitution | , |6 this | |2 nomination | |5 can | not |4 take | |2 effect | unless and until |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | |7 Senate | |4 gives | |3 its | |2 Consent | , as |4 described | in |3 our | |2 Constitution | , |2 Article | II , |2 Section | 2 ."
"|6 A | |2 copy | of |6 the | |2 Constitution | , with |2 links | |1 back | to |6 the | |0 official | |2 source | , |5 is | |4 located | at http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt"
|2 Judge | |7 Samuel | |7 Alito | |5 is | |1 very | |1 highly | |0 qualified | by |6 all | of |6 the | |0 normal | |2 standards | |4 used | to |4 evaluate | |2 candidates | for |6 this | |2 position | :
|3 He | |4 has | |6 a | |1 very | |0 high | |2 intellect | .
"|3 He | |4 graduated | |1 very | |1 high | in |3 his | |2 class | , from |7 Princeton | |2 undergraduate | and from |2 Law | |2 School | at |7 Yale | ."
"|3 He | |4 has | |6 a | |0 long | and |0 distinguished | |2 record | , |4 including | |0 many | |2 years | as |6 a | |0 Federal | |2 Appeals | |2 Judge | , |6 the | |0 next | |2 level | below |7 Supreme | |7 Court | ."
"|3 He | |4 has | |0 encyclopedic | |2 knowledge | of |2 hundreds | of |0 different | |7 Supreme | |7 Court | |2 cases | , and |3 he | |5 can | |4 recite | |2 details | from |2 memory | ."
"|3 He | |4 demonstrates | |6 an | |0 excellent | "" |0 Judicial | |2 Temperament | , "" |5 being | |0 courteous | , |0 mild | - |0 mannered | , |0 respectful | of |6 all | |2 people | ; |0 careful | in |3 his | |2 work | , |0 meticulous | in |2 detail | ."
|3 His | |2 co-workers | |4 love | |3 him | .
|3 His | |0 fellow | |2 judges | |4 love | |3 him | .
|3 His | |2 family | |4 loves | |3 him | .
|7 President | |7 Bush | |4 loves | |3 him | .
"Yes , |3 it | |5 is | |0 true | that |6 some | |2 people | |5 do | n't |4 like | |6 the | |2 way | |3 they | |4 think | |3 he | |5 will | |4 vote | on |6 the | |7 Supreme | |7 Court | ."
"But |0 other | |2 people | |5 do | |4 like | |6 the | |2 way | |3 they | |4 think | |3 he | |5 will | |4 vote | , and |6 the | |2 ones | |3 who | |4 favor | |3 him | |4 seem | to |4 outnumber | |6 the | |2 ones | |3 who | |4 oppose | |3 him | ."
"|1 So | |1 now | |6 the | |7 Senate | |5 is | |4 getting | |0 ready | to |4 vote | |1 soon | , on whether to |4 approve | |3 him | or not ; and at |6 this | |2 moment | ( |2 evening | of |7 Jan. | 27 , 2006 ) |3 it | |4 looks | like |3 he | |4 has | |0 more | than |6 the | fifty - one |2 votes | |4 needed | for |2 approval | ."
"|6 The | |7 President | |5 is | |1 very | |0 eager | to |4 go | |1 ahead | |1 quickly | and |4 get | |6 this | |2 vote | , because |3 he | |1 very | |1 much | |4 wants | to |4 have | |7 Samuel | |7 Alito | on |6 the | |7 Supreme | |7 Court | , to |5 be | |4 judging | |6 the | |2 cases | |7 Bush | |5 is | |0 interested | in ."
|1 So | |3 there | |4 is | |6 a | |2 lot | of |4 hurry | - up |2 pressure | on |6 the | |7 Senate | to |4 give | |3 its | |0 prompt | |2 vote | of |2 approval | .
"|3 There | |4 is | |6 an | |0 old | |2 saying | |3 that | |4 applies | in |6 this | |2 situation | : "" |4 Act | in |2 haste | , |4 repent | at |2 leisure | . """
"|1 Sometimes | |3 you | |5 can | |4 make | |6 a | |0 bad | |2 decision | |1 very | |1 quickly | , |1 then | |4 regret | |3 it | for |0 many | |2 years | to |4 come | ."
"|3 That | |5 is | |3 what | |5 is | |0 about | to |4 happen | with |2 Judge | |7 Samuel | |7 Alito | , in |3 my | |2 opinion | , because |3 he | |4 has | one |0 tragic | |2 flaw | - |6 a | |1 very | |0 serious | |0 blind | |2 spot | in |3 his | |2 thinking | - |3 which | |4 makes | |3 him | |1 completely | |0 unacceptable | for |6 the | |2 position | of |7 Supreme | |7 Court | |2 Justice | : |3 He | |5 does | not |1 really | |4 agree | with |6 the | |2 system | of "" |2 Checks | and |2 Balances | "" |4 built | into |6 the | |2 Constitution | , and |3 he | |5 is | |0 ready | to |4 start | |4 tearing | |3 it | down in |2 order | to |4 follow | |6 the | "" |7 Unitary | |7 Executive | |7 Theory | , "" |3 which | |4 calls | for |1 vastly | - |4 increased | |0 Presidential | |2 Power | at |6 the | |2 expense | of |7 Congress | and |6 the | |7 Supreme | |7 Court | ."
And because of |6 this | |0 tragic | |2 flaw | . . .
""" |3 He | |5 Would | |4 Tear | Down |3 Our | |2 System | Of |2 Checks | And |2 Balances | , |4 Giving | |1 Far | |1 Too | |0 Much | |2 Power | To |6 The | |7 President | . """
"In |3 our | |0 Constitutional | |2 system | , |3 we | |4 have | three |2 branches | of |6 the | |7 Federal | |7 Government | : |6 the | |0 Legislative | , |0 Executive | , and |0 Judicial | |2 branches | ."
"And |6 the | |0 basic | |2 idea | behind |6 the | |2 Checks | and |2 Balances | |3 we | |4 have | |4 is | that if one |2 branch | of |6 the | |2 Government | |4 goes | |0 crazy | , |6 the | |0 other | two |5 can | |4 hold | |3 it | |1 down | ."
"But |7 Samuel | |7 Alito | |4 believes | in |6 a | |1 little | - |4 known | |0 Constitutional | |2 theory | - |4 called | |6 the | "" |7 Unitary | |7 Executive | |7 Theory | "" - |3 which | |4 says | that |6 the | |7 President | |5 should | |4 have | |0 complete | |2 control | over |6 the | |0 Executive | |2 Branch | , and that |6 the | |0 Executive | |2 Branch | |5 should | |5 be | in |2 charge | of |1 almost | |3 everything | |3 that | |6 the | |2 Government | |1 actually | |4 does | , |4 including | |6 the | |2 functions | of |6 the | |0 Independent | |2 Agencies | |3 which | |5 were | |4 designed | to |5 be | |0 free | of |0 Presidential | |2 control | , and |6 the | |2 Military | , |3 which | |4 exists | , |3 which | |5 is | |4 regulated | , and |3 which | |5 is | |4 funded | by |0 specific | |2 authority | |4 given | by |6 the | |2 Constitution | to |7 Congress | , |1 not | to |6 the | |7 President | ."
|6 The | |2 Military | |5 is | not |2 part | of |6 the | |0 Executive | |2 Branch | : |3 it | |5 is | |6 a | |0 separate | |2 entity | .
""" |7 Commander | In |7 Chief | "" |5 does | n't |4 mean | that |3 he | |5 is | |6 the | |2 boss | of |6 the | |2 Military | , |1 merely | |4 mean | that |3 he | |5 is | |6 the | |2 Administrator | , |1 just | as |3 he | |5 is | |6 the | |2 Administrator | of |6 the | |0 Executive | |2 Branch | , |4 charged | with "" |4 executing | |1 faithfully | "" |6 all | |6 the | |2 laws | |4 passed | by |7 Congress | and |6 all | |6 the | |2 Decisions | |4 rendered | by |6 the | |7 Supreme | |7 Court | ."
"Under |6 the | |7 Unitary | |7 Executive | |7 Theory | , |6 the | |2 Laws | of |7 Congress | and |2 Decisions | of |6 the | |7 Supreme | |7 Court | |4 have | |6 no | |0 actual | |2 authority | unless |6 the | |7 President | |4 agrees | with |3 them | ."
"And |1 so | |7 Congress | and |6 the | |7 Supreme | |7 Court | |4 become | |0 mere | |2 advisors | to |6 the | |7 President | , with |6 no | |0 real | |2 authority | over |3 him | ."
"And |6 the | |7 President | |4 becomes | |6 a | |2 Dictator | , |0 unrestrained | by |3 anything | in |6 the | |2 Constitution | , |4 backed | up by |6 the | |0 Armed | |2 Forces | , |3 which | |5 would | |5 be | |1 entirely | under |3 his | |0 personal | |2 control | ."
"And |1 thus | |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | of |7 America | - |6 The | |2 Land | Of |6 The | |0 Free | And |6 The | |2 Home | Of |6 The | |0 Brave | - |4 becomes | |1 just | |6 another | |0 Military | |2 Dictatorship | , |1 no | |0 better | than |7 Nazi | |7 Germany | or |0 Fascist | |7 Italy | during |7 World | |7 War | II ."
AND |3 THAT | |5 IS | |1 WHY | |6 ALL | |7 AMERICANS | |5 SHOULD | |4 OPPOSE | |6 THE | |2 NOMINATION | OF |7 SAMUEL | |7 ALITO | .

|6 An | |2 examination | of |6 the | |2 ramifications | of |6 such | |6 an | |2 attack | |5 is | |1 desperately | in |2 order | .

"|6 The | |0 recent | |2 elections | in |7 Iraq | |5 were | |4 dominated | by |6 an | |2 amalgam | of |1 religiously | |0 fundamentalist | |0 Shi'ite | |2 organizations | , |1 principally | |6 the | |7 Dawa | |7 Party | and |6 the | |7 Supreme | |7 Council | for |7 Islamic | |7 Revolution | in |7 Iraq | ( |7 SCIRI | ) ."
Both |7 Dawa | and |7 SCIRI | |4 have | |0 umbilical | |2 connections | to |6 the | |0 fundamentalist | |0 Shi'ite | |2 leadership | in |7 Iran | |3 that | |4 go | |1 back | |2 decades | .

"|0 Much | of |6 the | |2 violence | |4 aimed | at |0 American | |2 forces | |5 is | |4 coming | from |0 disgruntled | |0 Sunni | |2 factions | |3 that | |4 have | |3 their | |0 own | |2 militias | , |4 believe | |6 the | |0 last | |2 elections | |5 were | |6 a | |2 sham | , and |4 hold | |0 little | |0 political | |2 power | in |6 the | |2 government | ."

"|3 That | |5 would | |5 be | |0 preferable | but |3 it | |5 does | n't |4 matter | , |5 could | |5 be | |3 something | |0 similar |"
|3 It | |4 depends | on |6 the | |2 conditions | of |3 your | |0 skilled | |2 migrant | |2 visa | .
|3 Your | |2 visa | |5 should | |4 say | whether or |1 not | |3 you | |5 are | |4 restricted | to |4 work | in |6 a | |0 specific | |2 sector | .
If |3 your | |2 visa | |5 does | not |4 restrict | |3 you | from |4 taking | |6 any | |2 work | in |7 New | |7 Zealand | |1 then | |3 you | |5 can | |4 work | in |6 any | |2 sector | .
|3 It | |1 only | |4 matters | if |3 you | |4 received | |6 an | |2 offer | of |2 employment | or if |3 you | |5 are | |1 currently | |4 working | in |7 New | |7 Zealand | and |4 used | |6 that | |2 job | in |3 your | |2 application | to |4 get | |3 your | |0 skilled | |2 migrant | |2 visa | .
"In |7 Chicago | , |3 what | |5 is | |6 the | |0 best | |2 restaurant | to |4 dine | at on |6 a | |2 budget | ?"
"|2 Downtown | |7 Chicago | , |7 Loop | , |7 North |"
"|4 Take | |6 the | |0 red | |2 line | to |7 Clark | , |1 then | |3 you | |4 turn | |1 right | ."
|4 Walk | 2 |2 blocks | |1 then | |4 turn | |1 right | |1 again | .
|4 Walk | 2 |0 more | |2 blocks | |1 then | |4 cross | |6 the | |2 street | .
"|3 You | |5 will | |4 get | to |6 a | |2 place | |4 called | "" |7 BIG | |7 BOWL | "" ."
|0 THAI | |2 FOOD | AND |0 ASIAN | .
|0 BEST | |2 PLACE | |1 EVER | !!!!!!!!!!!!
|7 McDonald | s
Not |1 necessarily | |6 the | |2 restaurant | but |3 what | |3 you | |4 order | |1 when | |3 you | |4 get | |1 there | and |6 what | |2 time | |3 you | |4 go | .
|6 A | |2 lunch | |5 will | |5 be | |1 less | |0 expensive | than |6 a | |2 dinner | .
|3 You | |5 can | |4 order | |2 appetizers | |1 rather | than |6 a | |0 full | |2 meal | and |4 have | |1 just | |1 as | |0 good | |6 a | |2 dinner | .
But |6 the | |0 best | |2 way | |4 is | to |4 use | |2 coupons | .
|4 Check | out http://www.restaurant.com |2 lots | of |2 restaurants | |3 you | |5 can | |4 look | at |6 the | |2 menu | and |4 check | out |2 prices | .
"|3 Yo | |1 also | |5 may | |4 want | to |4 try | "" |0 small | |2 neighborhood | "" |2 restaurants | and |4 support | |2 family | |4 run | |2 places | |1 rather | than |6 the | |0 large | |0 corporate | |2 chains | ."
Not that |3 there | |4 is | |3 anything | |0 wrong | with |3 that | because |3 they | |1 also | |4 employ | |0 local | |2 people | |3 that | |4 live | and |4 shop | in |6 the | |2 area | .
|4 Is | |3 there | |6 any | |2 cure | for |2 mouse | |2 poison | ?
"|3 I | |4 found | |6 a | |0 poor | |2 little | |2 mouse | |4 walking | |1 around | in |3 my | |2 friend | s |2 house | , and since |3 I | |5 was | |0 able | to |4 catch | |3 it | |1 very | |1 easily | ( |1 normally | |2 mice | |4 move | at |6 the | |2 speed | of |2 light | ) , and since |3 it | |5 was | |4 acting | |0 unresponsive | , |3 I | |4 thought | |3 it | |5 was | |4 infected | with |2 mouse | |2 poison | , since |3 my | |2 friend | |4 uses | |3 it | ."
"|3 I | |4 know | that |6 the | |2 mouse | |5 will | |1 probably | |4 die | , but |3 I | |5 was | |4 wondering | if |3 there | |4 is | |6 any | |2 cure | for |2 mouse | |2 poison | ?"
|3 I | |1 just | |4 hate | to |4 see | |6 the | |0 poor | |2 dears | |4 experience | |6 a | |0 slow | |0 painful | |2 death | |6 that | |2 way | :( .
"Without |4 knowing | |6 the | |0 exact | |2 poison | , no ."
|6 A | |0 common | |2 one | |5 is | |2 arsenic | and |3 there | |1 really | |4 is | n't |6 a | |2 way | to |4 cure | |3 that | .
|4 Take | |6 the | |2 mouse | to |6 an | |2 emergency | |2 vet | and |4 have | |3 them | |4 use | |2 CO2 | to |4 put | |6 the | |2 mouse | to |2 sleep | .
"Or , |3 you | |5 can | |4 put | |6 the | |2 animal | in |6 a | |2 snap | |2 trap | |4 designed | for |2 rats | or |2 mice | since |3 that | |5 is | |6 the | |0 only | |1 really | |0 humane | |2 kill | |2 method | for |0 invasive | |2 animals | ."
|6 A | |0 quick | |2 cure | |5 would | |5 be | |7 Arm | & |7 Hammer | to |3 it's | |2 head | .

Ok .
|1 So | |3 I | |4 have | |6 a | |1 VERY | |0 long | |2 list | of |2 people | |3 I | |4 want | to |4 make | |7 Xmas | |2 gifts | for and one of |3 them | |5 is | |3 my | |0 best | |2 friend | .
|3 She | |4 loves | |2 giraffes | and |0 homemade | |2 things | !
|3 I | |5 am | |1 very | |0 artistic | |1 so | |3 I | |4 decided | |3 I | |5 was | |4 going | to |4 make | |3 her | |6 a | |2 giraffe | |2 sculpture | .
|3 I | |5 do | n't |4 have | |0 much | |2 money | |1 so | |3 I | |4 bought | |7 Crayola | |2 Air | - |2 Dry | |2 Clay | .
|3 I | |5 have | |4 sculpted | |6 the | |2 giraffe | |4 laying | |1 down | .
|6 The | |2 key | |4 is | ... |3 I | |4 have | |6 a | |0 few | |2 problems | :
1 . |3 I | |4 tested | |3 it | out by |4 making | |6 a | |2 figure | |2 boat |
And after 4 |2 days | |1 when | |3 it | |4 dried | |3 it | |5 was | |1 very | |0 fragile | !
( like |1 VERY | not in |6 a | |0 good | |2 way | )
|4 Is | |3 there | |6 any | |2 way | to |4 strengthen | |3 it | ?
2 . |6 What | |2 kind | of |2 paint | |5 do | |3 I | |4 use | to |4 paint | |6 the | |2 giraffe | ?
3 . |4 Is | |3 there | |6 any | |0 cheap | |2 way | to |4 give | |3 it | |6 a | |2 shine | like |3 I | |4 made | |3 it | in |6 a | |2 kiln | ?
"|2 air | |2 dry | |2 clay | |4 works | on |2 armatures | , |6 the | |2 clay | |4 has | |6 a | |0 minor | |2 shrink | |2 percent | , |1 so | |3 you | |5 can | |4 leave | |6 the | |2 wire | |2 armature | |1 inside | , |4 paint | with |0 acrylic | |2 paint |"
|4 taking | |0 young | |2 cat | with |3 me | for |6 a | |2 week | out of |2 state | ?
|0 good | |2 idea | ?
|3 i | |4 have | |6 a | 3 - 4 |2 month | |0 old | |2 kitten | and |3 i | |4 live | in |7 forida | .
|3 i | |5 am | |4 going | to |3 my | |2 grandma | s in |7 north | |7 carolina | and |3 we | |5 are | |4 going | |4 camping | in |6 a | |2 cabin | in |7 west | |7 virginia | .
|3 My | |2 cat | |5 is | |6 a | |0 outside | |2 cat | but |3 she | |4 loves | |3 it | |1 inside | .
|3 she | |5 is | |1 also | |0 good | in |6 a | |2 carrier | .
|5 Should | |3 i | |4 bring | |3 her | ?
if |1 so | |1 how | |1 quick | |5 will | |3 she | |4 adapt | to |6 a | |2 litter | |2 box | |1 inside | ?
|2 thanks |
|3 We | |4 took | |3 our | |2 cat | |7 Mitten | |4 camping | .
|3 He | |4 loved | |3 it | .
But |3 he | |5 was | |6 an | |0 inside | / |0 outside | |2 cat | ( |1 only | one |3 I | |4 owned | - |2 rest | |5 have | |5 been | 100 |0 0nside | |2 cats | ) .
|3 He | |5 was | |4 trained | to |6 a | |2 harness | / |2 leash | for |0 outside | |2 time | but |3 he | |4 knew | to |4 use | |6 the | |2 litter | |2 pan | |1 inside | .
"If |3 your | |2 cat | |5 is | not |4 trained | to |4 use | |6 the | |2 litter | |2 pan | , |3 you | |5 may | |4 have | |6 a | |2 problem | |4 taking | |3 her | ."
NO !
"|4 changing | |3 its | |2 surroundings | |1 too | |1 often | |5 will | |4 stress | |3 it | out and |3 it | |5 will | |4 get | |0 depressed | , |0 mean | , |0 sick | , or |5 will | not |4 want | to |5 be | around |3 you | ."
|6 What | |2 cleaners | |5 should | |3 I | |4 use | for |4 dusting | around |3 my | |2 parakeet | ?
|6 What | |2 cleaners | |5 can | |3 I | |4 use | to |4 dust | around |3 my | |2 budgie | .
|5 Would | |7 pledge | |5 be | |0 ok | ?
"If not , |3 what | |4 is | ?"
|3 Your | |0 best | |2 bet | |5 would | |1 just | |5 be | |6 a | |7 swiffer | |2 duster | -- |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 require | |2 cleaner | .
"If |3 you | |5 must | |4 use | |6 a | |2 cleaner | , |7 pledge | |5 should | |5 be | |0 fine | if |6 the | |2 area | |3 that | |3 you | |4 keep | |3 your | |2 parakeet | in |4 is | |1 well | |4 ventilated | ."
"|3 I | |5 have | |4 had | |2 parakeets | for |6 a | |1 VERY | |0 long | |2 time | , and |3 I | |4 use | |7 pledge | ."
|1 Just | |4 keep | |6 a | |2 window | |0 open | for |6 a | |2 while | for |0 fresh | |2 air | to |4 circulate | .
|3 I | |4 agree | w |6 the | |2 answer | from |7 Nothing | .
|1 Even | |6 a | |2 cotton | |2 cloth | ( |3 I | |4 like | |2 diapers | ) |3 that | |5 is | |1 barely | |0 damp | w |2 water | |5 will | |4 work | |1 fine | .
|7 Swiffer | or |6 any | |2 type | of |0 micro-fiber | |2 cloth | |5 is | |0 excellent | .
"|3 I | |4 use | |7 Miracle | |7 Cloth | , |3 they | |5 're | |0 fantastic | , |1 just | |5 do | n't |4 use | |2 fabric | |2 softener | or |2 dryer | |2 sheets | |1 when | |4 cleaning | |3 them | , |3 it | |4 ruins | |3 their | "" |4 grabbing | "" |2 ability | ."

Unless |6 the | |2 tank | |4 has | |6 a | |4 built | in |2 overflow | |2 box | ( |3 which | |3 I | |5 'm | |0 certain | |3 it | |4 does | n't ) |1 then | |3 you | |4 have | to |4 get | one of |6 those | |4 hang | on |2 back | |2 overflow | |2 boxes | so that |3 you | |5 can | |4 install | |6 a | |2 sump | .
|6 The | |2 piping | |5 would | |4 lead | |1 down | into |3 your | |2 sump | from |6 the | |2 overflow | |2 box | .
"On |6 the | |0 other | |2 end | of |6 the | |2 sump | , |3 you | |5 would | |4 have | |6 a | |0 small | |2 return | |2 pump | with |6 a | |2 hose | |3 that | |4 puts | |6 the | |2 water | |1 back | into |3 your | |2 tank | ."

|4 Know | that |3 there | |4 are | |2 pros | and |2 cons | to |2 laser | |2 sights | before |3 you | |4 mount | |3 them | on |3 your | |2 wang | .
"While |3 they | |5 are | |1 extremely | |0 accurate | , |2 laser | |2 sights | |5 do | not |4 operate | |1 well | |1 when | |0 drunk | or |0 high | because |6 the | |2 beam | |1 often | |5 does | not |4 show | up on |6 the | |2 target | ."
"|1 Therefore | , |3 you | |5 must | |4 learn | to |4 shoot | |1 manually | ."
2
|4 Mount | |2 laser | |2 sights | |1 on | |1 away | by |4 removing | |6 the | |2 hand | |2 grip | .
|2 Laser | |2 grips | |5 are | |6 the | |1 most | |0 common | for |2 wangs | .
|6 The | |2 laser | |5 is | |4 made | into |6 the | |2 hand | |2 grip | and |4 has | |6 a | |2 switch | on |6 the | |2 side | to |4 turn | |3 it | on .
|4 Remove | |3 your | |2 fingers | from |6 the | |4 existing | |2 grip | and |4 replace | |3 them | with |3 your | |0 new | |2 laser | |2 grip | .
|3 You | |4 have | two |2 adjustment | |2 screws | for |0 up | and |0 down | and |0 right | to |0 left | |2 positions | .

|4 Consider | |6 these | |2 points | for |4 mounting | |2 laser | |2 sights | on |0 semi-automatic | |2 wangs | .
|0 Newer | |0 semi-automatic | |2 wangs | |4 have | |6 a | |2 rail | |4 built | into |6 the | |2 receiver | under |6 the | |2 shaft | .

4
|4 Prepare | to |4 mount | |6 the | |2 laser | |2 sight | onto |6 the | |2 rail | on |6 the | |2 wang | .
|3 You | |4 have | two |2 screws | |3 that | |4 attach | |6 the | |2 sight | to |6 the | |2 wang | .
|4 Tighten | |6 these | |2 screws | |1 securely | .
|4 Flip | |6 the | |2 switch | and |4 adjust | |3 your | |2 laser | |2 sight | |4 according | to |6 the | |2 directions | in |6 the | |2 owner | |2 manual | |3 that | |4 comes | with |6 the | |2 laser | |2 sight | .

"|3 He | |5 was | |1 so | |0 eager | to |4 go | in |6 the | |2 nest | and |4 feed | |6 the | |2 baby | and |3 she | |1 always | |5 would | |4 go | |1 right | |1 away | in |6 the | |2 nest | after |3 him | and |4 give | |3 him | |6 a | |2 fight | |1 right | |1 there | , |1 were | |6 the | |2 baby | |4 was | |1 too | ."
|3 I | |4 thought | |3 it | |5 was | |0 dangerous | for |6 the | |2 baby | |1 so | |3 I | |4 moved | |3 him | .
"|3 She | |4 feeds | |1 well | |6 the | |2 baby | on |3 her | |0 own | , |6 the | |2 baby | |5 is | |0 ok | but |3 she | |5 does | not |4 go | in |6 the | |2 nest | to |4 stay | with |3 him | at |2 night | ..."

|3 It | |5 's | |0 fine | - |1 just | |4 make | |0 sure | that |6 the | |2 room | |6 the | |2 cage | |5 is | in |5 is | |4 kept | |0 warm | .

|5 Do | n't |4 know | |6 the | |2 economics | of |7 Fujairah | but |7 Dubai | |5 is | |1 basically | |0 bankrupt | |1 so | |3 you | |5 would | n't |4 want | to |4 end | up like |3 them | !
Unless |3 you | |4 have | |6 a | |0 particular | |2 skill | |3 they | |4 need | - and |0 firm | |2 job | |2 offer | before |4 going | - |3 I | |5 would | |4 think | |1 twice | about |3 it | !

|1 No | |1 matter | |1 when | |3 you | |4 buy | |3 you | |5 will | |4 get | |6 a | |0 newer | |2 version | .
"|3 I | |4 feel | |7 X | - |7 BOX | |5 is | |6 a | |1 very | |0 smooth | |2 system | |3 i | |4 own | |3 it | like 3 |2 years | , |3 it | |5 s | |1 very | |0 compatible | to |0 previous | |2 versions | and |1 mostly | |0 important | |3 i | |5 was | |1 very | |0 comfortable | with |6 the | |2 User | |2 Interface | and |6 the | |2 JOYSTICK | .... coz |3 you | |5 do | nt |4 wan | a |4 hold | |6 a | |2 joystick | |3 that | |4 gives | |3 you | |2 discomfort | ."

Since |3 they | |4 released | |7 kinect | |3 this | |5 was | |1 kind | |1 of | |3 their | |2 way | of |4 releasing | |6 a | |0 new | |7 Xbox | |1 so | |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 plan | on |4 making | |6 another | |2 one | for |6 a | |2 while | .

"|3 I | |4 read | |1 somewhere | that |3 you | |4 have | to |4 hold | |3 his | |2 mouth | |1 together | , and |4 keep | |3 it | |6 that | |2 way | til |3 he | |4 panics | ."
|3 That | |4 seems | |0 cruel | to |3 me | |1 though | .
|6 Any | |0 other | |2 way | ??
|5 Do | |3 you | |4 think | |3 he | |5 's | |4 teething | ?
|3 It | |5 's | |4 getting | out of |2 hand | .

|3 He | |5 'd | |1 just | |1 randomly | |4 walk | up to |3 you | and |4 start | |6 the | |2 biting | .
"|1 When | |3 i | |4 put | |3 him | off of |3 my | |2 bed | , |3 he | |4 jumps | |1 back | |1 on | and |0 same | |2 thing | ."
|3 he | |5 may | |5 be | |4 teething | but |3 i | |5 do | nt |4 think | |3 it | |5 can | |5 be | |4 stopped | .
|1 maybe | |4 buy | |3 him | |2 toys | |3 that | |3 he | |5 can | |4 play | with |3 that | |4 give | |3 him | |6 a | |2 way | to |4 use | |3 his | |2 energy | up

|5 is | under |2 tank | |2 heating | or |2 side | |2 tank | |2 heating | |0 better | for |6 a | |2 corn | |2 snake | ?
|3 i | |5 was | |4 reading | |6 the | |2 package | for |6 a | |2 tank | |2 heater | |3 i | |4 bought | for |3 my | 40 |2 gallon | |2 tank | for |3 my | |2 snake | and |3 it | |4 said | |3 it | |5 can | |5 be | |4 put | under |6 the | |2 tank | or on |6 the | |2 side | .
|3 i | |4 m | not |0 worried | about |4 damaging | |6 the | |2 surface | |3 my | |2 tank | |5 is | on because |3 i | |5 can | |4 prop | |3 it | up off |6 the | |2 surface | |1 anyway | .
"from |3 my | |2 understanding | , if |3 it | |5 s | |4 heated | from |6 the | |2 bottom | , |3 my | |2 snake | |4 risks | |4 burning | |3 its | |2 belly | if |3 it | |4 burrows | and |4 rests | |1 directly | on |2 top | of |6 the | |2 glass | over |6 the | |2 heater | unless |3 i | |4 buy | |6 some | of |6 that | |2 reptile | |2 carpet | to |4 put | under |6 the | |2 substrate | , but |3 it | |4 has | |0 better | |2 heat | |2 distribution |"
"if |3 it | |5 s | from |6 the | |2 side | |3 i | |5 do | nt |4 have | to |4 worry | about |4 propping | |3 it | up , but |6 the | |2 snake | |5 can | |1 still | |4 burn | |3 itself | if |3 it | |4 slithers | along |6 the | |2 side | of |6 the | |2 tank | and |3 i | |1 also | |4 read | that |3 it | |5 does | nt |4 distribute | |2 heat | |1 as | |1 well | ?"
|3 what | |5 are | |3 your | |2 suggestions | and |2 opinons | ?
|3 i | |4 use | |2 UTH's | on |6 all | of |3 my | |4 burrowing | |2 snakes | .
|3 they | |5 will | |4 move | if |3 they | |4 get | |1 too | |0 warm | - |3 it | |5 's | not like |6 a | |2 heat | |2 rock | |3 which | |3 you | |5 should | |4 avoid | at |6 all | |2 costs | .
|3 i | |1 usually | |4 put | |3 my | |0 own | |0 natural | |2 rock | over |6 the | |2 UTH | and |3 they | |5 are | |1 perfectly | |0 fine | .
"|3 i | |4 have | |1 over | 40 |2 corns | , |2 kings | , and |2 milks | and |5 have | |1 never | |4 had | |6 a | |2 problem | with |6 the | |2 UTH | |2 system | ."
on |6 the | |2 side | |5 is | |6 a | |2 waste | - |4 leave | |3 it | on |6 the | |2 bottom | .
|0 good | |2 luck | !
|2 Bottom | if |3 you | |5 are | |0 worried | about |6 the | |2 snake | |4 burning | |3 itself | |4 put | |3 something | overt |3 it | like |2 newspaper | ...
|3 I | |1 now | |4 use | |6 a | 75 |2 watt | |2 basking | or |2 heat | |2 bulb | for |3 mine | and |3 he | |4 seems | to |4 like | |3 it |

Unless |3 you | |4 plan | on |5 being | |0 late | for |6 the | |0 bridal | |2 shower | |3 you | |5 might | |4 want | to |4 post | |3 this | |1 again | in |6 the | |7 L.A. | |2 section | .
|2 Question | about |6 the | |2 sinking | of |6 the | |7 Titanic | ?
"After |6 the | |2 sinking | of |6 the | |7 Titanic | in 1912 , |4 was | |3 there | |6 a | |2 law | |4 made | so that |2 ships | |5 would | |4 carry | |0 enough | |2 lifeboats | to |4 save | |3 everybody | on |6 a | |2 ship | if |3 it | |5 was | |4 sinking | ?"
"If yes , |5 was | |7 Canada | |0 involved | in |6 this | |2 act | / |2 law | ?"
"Sorry , |3 I | |5 'm | |1 just | |1 very | |0 nervous | after |4 watching | |6 the | |2 movie | ."
"|7 SOLAS | ( |7 Safety | Of |7 Life | At |7 Sea | ) , |3 which | |5 is | |6 an | |0 international | |0 maritime | |2 treaty | , |4 came | |1 about | in |2 response | to |6 the | |2 tragedy | of |6 the | |7 Titanic | ."
"|2 Today | , |3 it | |5 is | |6 the | |0 primary | |2 safety | |2 law | |4 affecting | |1 virtually | |6 all | |2 ships | , |1 regardless | of |2 country | of |2 registration | ."
"If |3 you | |1 ever | |4 go | on |6 a | |2 cruise | |2 ship | , |3 you | |5 will | |5 be | |4 required | to |4 attend | |6 a | |7 SOLAS | |2 muster | |2 drill | ( |2 lifeboat | |2 drill | ) within 24 |2 hours | of |2 sailing | ."
|0 Most | |2 ships | |4 perform | |6 this | |2 drill | before |1 even | |4 leaving | |6 the | |2 dock | .
"|7 SOLAS | |4 covers | |1 just | |1 about | |6 every | |2 aspect | of |2 safety | at |2 sea | , |4 including | |0 minimum | |2 safety | |2 equipment | , |2 practices | , and |2 standards | , |2 lifeboats | , |2 navigation | |2 practices | , |2 fire | |2 protection | , and |1 so | |1 on | ."
"|3 We | |5 are | |1 much | |0 safer | |2 today | on board |2 ship | due to |7 SOLAS | , and |3 I | |4 suppose | if |6 any | |0 good | |4 came | out of |6 the | |7 Titanic | |2 tragedy | , |6 the | |2 adoption | of |7 SOLAS | |5 is | |1 probably | |3 it | ."

"|2 Edit | : |1 Also | |3 I | |4 forgot | to |4 mention | |1 earlier | , |0 most | ( if not |6 all | ) |2 cruise | |2 ships | |1 also | |4 practice | |2 lifeboat | |2 drills | |1 weekly | , and |3 it | |5 is | |1 not | |0 uncommon | to |4 see | |3 them | to |1 actually | |4 launch | |6 the | |2 lifeboats | into |6 the | |2 water | as |2 part | of |3 their | |2 drill | |1 when | |3 you | |5 are | in |2 port | ."
"|3 This | |1 not | |1 only | |4 ensures | |6 the | |2 lifeboats | |5 are | |0 operational | and |5 will | |4 work | if |4 needed | , but |4 makes | |6 the | |2 crew | |0 proficient | at |4 launching | |3 them | ."
|3 I | |5 do | n't |4 think | |1 so |
|5 Do | n't |4 worry | .
|1 When | |5 was | |6 the | |0 last | |2 time | |3 you | |4 heard | about |6 a | |2 ship | |4 sinking | ?
100 |2 years | |1 ago | ?
|3 What | |5 are | |6 some | |0 fun | |2 things | |3 I | |5 could | |4 do | while in |7 Japan | ?
|3 I | |5 'll | |5 be | in |7 Okinawa | for |1 about | |6 a | |2 week | |1 so | |3 I | |5 was | |4 wondering | |3 what | |5 are | |6 some | |0 fun | |2 things | |3 I | |5 could | |4 do | ?
|3 I | |5 'm | |6 a | 20 |2 year | |0 old | |0 female | |4 travelling | by |3 myself | |1 so | |3 it | |5 could | |5 be | |3 anything | .
Besides |6 the | |0 obvious | |2 tourist | |2 spots | |3 which | |3 I | |1 already | |5 have | |4 planned | for .
|1 How | |5 is | |6 the | |2 night | |2 life | in |7 Naha | ?
"|4 Are | |3 there | |6 any | |0 good | |2 venues | |3 that | |4 showcase | |0 underground | |2 bands | , or |1 just | |6 a | |2 venue | |1 at | |1 all | ?"
|3 It | |5 does | n't |4 have | to |5 be | |0 underground | |3 it | |5 could | |5 be | |6 any | |2 type | of |2 music | .
|2 Thanks |
|6 The | |0 best | |2 thing | |3 you | |5 can | |4 do | in |7 Okinawa | |4 is | to |4 go | to |6 a | |2 beach | .
"|1 Otherwise | , |3 you | |5 can | |4 do | |3 what | |3 you | |5 can | |4 do | in |0 other | |2 parts | or |7 Japan | , like |2 shopping | , |2 eating | , etc ."
Or |3 you | |5 can | |4 visit | |2 temples | or |2 shrines | in |7 Okinawa | .
Well |1 first | |3 you | |5 can | |4 try | |4 speaking | |7 Japanese | .
|4 Go | to |6 a | |2 sumo | |2 tournament | .
|4 Eat | at |6 a | |2 conveyor | - |2 belt | |2 sushi | |2 restaurant | .
|4 Climb | |7 Mount | |7 Fuji | .
"|7 Okinawa | |5 is | |1 quite | |0 different | from |6 the | |2 rest | of |7 Japan | , although |1 of | |1 course | |3 there | |4 are | |2 similarities | ."
|6 The | |0 main | |2 thing | |2 people | |4 do | |1 there | |4 is | |4 go | to |6 the | |2 beach | .
"|3 There | |4 's | |6 the | |2 market | in |7 Naha | , |3 which | |5 is | |0 great | ."
"|3 You | |5 can | |4 find | |6 all | |2 sorts | of |0 fresh | |2 food | and |4 get | |6 a | |1 really | |0 delicious | , |0 fresh | |2 sashimi | / |2 sushi | |2 lunch | |1 upstairs | ."
|4 Try | |6 the | |0 local | |2 sake | |1 too | if |3 you | |5 can | .
|3 It | |5 's | |6 a | |0 special | |2 kind | .
|3 I | |5 'm | not |0 sure | that |3 there | |4 's | |0 much | |2 nightlife | in |7 Naha | .
"|3 It | |5 's | |0 more | of |6 a | |2 place | to |4 go | to |4 enjoy | |6 the | |2 weather | , |6 the | |2 sea | , etc ."
|3 You | |5 might | |4 have | to |4 make | |3 your | |0 own | |2 nightlife | by |4 finding | |6 an | |2 izakaya | ( |2 pub | ) |1 somewhere | .
|3 Your | |0 best | |2 bet | |5 would | |1 probably | |4 be | to |4 get | |6 a | |2 copy | of |6 the | |7 Lonely | |7 Planet | |7 Japan | |2 book | and |4 read | |6 the | |2 chapter | on |7 Okinawa | .
|7 Naha | |5 's | not |6 a | |1 very | |0 big | |2 city | .
|0 Modern | |2 m | 16 vs |7 Vietnam | |2 m | 16 |2 version | ?
"|3 I | |5 was | |4 playing | |6 a | |2 video | |2 game | |3 that | |4 has | |6 a | |2 m | 16 |7 Vietnam | |2 model | , and in |6 the | |2 game | |3 it | |5 's | 3 - |2 shot | |2 burst | ."
|3 My | |2 brother | |4 said | |3 they | |1 only | |4 had | |0 full | - |2 auto | and |0 semiautomatic | during |7 Vietnam | .
|3 My | |2 questions | |4 are | ..
1 ) |3 what | |6 the | |5 s | |2 difference | between |6 a | |0 modern | |2 m16 | and |7 Vietnam | |2 m | 16 ?
2 ) |5 did | |7 Vietnam | |2 m | |2 16's | |4 have | |6 a | 3 - |2 shot | |2 burst | |2 function | ?
To |4 save | |2 money | |7 Robert | |7 McNamara | |4 ordered | that |6 the | |2 ammunition | for |6 the | |0 new | |2 M | - |2 16s | |5 being | |4 sent | to |2 SEA | in |6 the | |0 early | |2 60s | |4 use | |6 an | |0 older | ( |0 dirtier | ) |2 type | of |2 gunpowder | |4 meant | for |2 use | with |6 the | |2 M | - 14 .
|3 He | |1 also | |4 ordered | that |6 the | |2 receiver | |1 not | |4 get | |6 a | ( |3 I | |4 think | |2 chrome | ) |2 coating | |3 that | |4 helped | |4 keep | |6 the | |2 gun | from |4 jamming | .
"|1 Than | |6 the | |2 troops | |5 being | |4 issued | |6 the | |2 weapon | |5 were | |4 told | |3 it | |5 was | |2 self | - |4 cleaning | , |6 which | |3 it | |5 was | n't ."
As |6 a | |2 result | |3 there | |4 was | |6 a | |2 problem | with |6 the | |2 weapon | |4 jamming | .
Once |6 the | |2 troops | |4 started | |4 cleaning | |6 the | |2 weapon | |1 properly | ( |1 even | with |6 the | |0 dirtier | |2 powder | ) |6 the | |7 Vietnam | |7 era | |2 M | - 16 |4 turned | out to |5 be | |6 a | |0 good | |2 weapon | for |6 the | |2 purpose | |3 it | |5 was | |5 being | |4 used | for .
|6 The | |2 screw | - |2 up | |5 was | |6 the | |2 kind | of |2 things | |3 you | |4 have | |4 happen | |1 when | |3 you | |4 have | |2 bean | - |2 counters | ( and |7 McNamara | |5 was | |3 nothing | if |1 not | |6 a | |2 bean | - |2 counter | ) |1 instead | of |2 soldiers | in |2 charge | of |6 the | |2 military | .
"|2 Today | 's |2 weapons | |5 do | not |4 have | |6 that | |2 kind | of |2 problem | , and |5 are | |1 much | |1 more | |0 reliable | ."
1 ) |0 modern | |2 m | 16 |5 is | |0 alright | .
|7 Vietnam | |2 m | 16 |4 used | to |4 clog | up and |1 never | |4 work | .
2 ) |6 All | |2 M | |2 16's | |5 are | either |0 automatic | or semi |0 automatic | .
|6 No | |2 one | |4 uses | 3 |2 burst | .
|3 you | |4 play | |1 too | |0 much | |7 cod | ;P
|0 modern | |2 m | 16 |5 is | |0 best |
|4 Planning | on |4 going | to |7 New | |7 Zealand | in |7 January | .
|5 Is | |3 it | |0 OK | to |4 holiday | in |7 Christchurch | since |6 the | |2 Earthquakes | ?

|7 Rotorua | |5 is | |0 fine | .
"|3 I | |5 'm | |4 assuming | |3 this | |5 was | in |2 reference | to |6 the | |7 January | |2 earthquake | , |5 do | n't |4 worry | , |3 it | |5 was | |1 very | |0 deep | , |1 so | |3 nothing | |5 was | |4 effected | :)"
"As for |7 Christchurch | , yes |6 the | |2 aftershocks | |5 are | |1 still | |4 happening | , but |3 these | |5 are | |1 fairly | |0 small | - |3 you | |5 can | |4 feel | |3 them | , but |3 the | |5 do | n't |4 do | |6 any | |2 damage | ."
"Since |2 lots | of |2 people | |5 are | |1 still | |4 living | |1 there | , |1 then | |3 it | |5 must | |5 be | |0 fine | to |4 visit | ."
|1 However | |6 the | |7 CBD | |4 is | |4 closed | of to |6 the | |2 public | as |6 a | |2 lot | of |3 it | |5 is | |1 still | |2 rubble | and |2 stuff | and |5 has | n't |5 been | |4 cleared | away |1 yet | .
"|3 I | |5 'm | |0 sure | that |3 you | |5 can | |4 find | |6 some | |2 hotels | |3 that | |5 are | |4 running | in |6 the | |7 christchurch | |2 area | , but if not |1 then | |3 there | |5 would | |4 be | |6 some | in |0 close | |1 by | |2 towns | ."
"Despite |6 the | |2 aftershocks | |3 I | |5 would | |4 recommend | |4 going | to |7 Christchurch | , |1 just | for |6 the | |2 experience | and |1 then | |3 you | |5 can | |4 see | |1 first | |2 hand | |1 how | |2 things | |5 get | |4 effected | by |2 earthquakes | ."

"|2 Loads | of |2 places | |4 have | |0 geographical | |2 hazards | , if |3 you | |5 are | |1 constantly | |0 paranoid | , |3 you | |5 'll | |1 never | |4 get | |1 anywhere | without |6 a | |2 sense | of |2 adventure | ."
"In |2 case | of |6 an | |2 earthquake | , |4 stay | under |6 a | |2 sturdy | |2 table | and |5 do | n't |4 go | |1 outside | as |0 possible | |2 debris | |5 will | |4 fall | ."

"|6 The | |2 lighting | |5 was | not |6 the | |0 best | , but |6 the | |2 pics | |4 turned | out |0 ok | in |3 my | |2 opinion | ."
|4 deleting | |6 a | |2 question | |1 where | |3 you | |5 do | nt |4 like | |6 the | |2 answer | |5 wo | n't |4 get | |3 you | |0 better | |2 answers | ... |3 i | |4 refer | to |3 my | |0 previous | |2 answer | :
"|3 you | |4 need | to |4 learn | about |0 white | |2 balance | , |2 composition | , |2 angle | , and |4 work | on |4 using | |6 the | |2 camera | |1 properly | ..."
"[ |2 edit | - and |3 she | |5 most | |5 be | |1 very | |0 new | to |2 modeling | , because |3 she | |5 does | |4 look | |0 unsure | of |3 her | |2 poses | )"
"lol , |3 he | |5 has | |4 posted | |3 this | |1 so | |0 many | |2 times | |2 today | |1 already | ."
|1 clearly | |3 he | |5 s | |0 mad | that |2 people | |4 know | |3 he | |4 took | |3 her | |2 pic | off |6 the | |2 net | and |3 it | |5 's | NOT |3 his | |2 gf |
"|1 Not | |0 bad | , but |1 too | |0 many | |0 distracting | |2 elements | for |3 my | |2 taste | ."
For |2 example | :
"In |6 the | |2 photo | on |6 the | |2 couch | , |6 the | |2 pillow | |3 she | |5 is | |4 resting | on |4 clashes | with |3 everything | |0 else | in |6 the | |2 shot | ."
|3 There | |4 are | |1 also | |6 some | |0 distracting | |2 background | |2 elements | like |6 the | |2 light | |2 fixture | and |3 what | |4 looks | like |6 a | |2 door | |2 handle | on |6 the | |2 left | .
"In |6 the | |2 standing | |2 photo | ( from |6 the | |2 front | ) |3 there | |4 is | |6 a | |2 corner | of |6 a | |2 rug | |4 creeping | |1 in | , |6 some | |2 kind | of |2 box | in |6 the | |0 lower | |0 right | |2 corner | and |3 what | |4 looks | like |6 a | |2 power | |2 cord | ."
"In |6 the | |2 shot | from |6 the | |2 back | , |6 the | |4 crumpled | |2 bottom | of |6 the | |2 curtain | |5 is | |1 pretty | |0 noticeable | |1 as | |1 well | as |6 the | |2 power | |2 outlet | ."
"|1 Compositionally | , |6 this | one |5 is | not |3 my | |2 favorite | , |3 I | |5 would | |4 suggest | |4 trying | |6 a | |0 different | |2 crop | because |3 I | |5 do | nt |4 think | |4 cutting | |3 her | off at |6 the | |2 calf | |4 looks | |0 great | ."
"|3 I | |5 do | |4 like | |6 the | |2 shadow | , |1 though | ."
"|3 My | |2 suggestion | |4 is | to |4 pay | |0 close | |2 attention | to |3 what | |5 's | |4 going | on in |6 the | |2 background | and if |0 possible | , |4 stand | on |6 a | |2 chair | , |4 get | on |6 the | |2 ground | , |4 do | |3 whatever | |3 you | |4 need | to |4 do | to |4 get | |0 rid | of |0 distracting | |2 elements | ."
|4 Using | |6 a | |1 fairly | |0 wide | |2 aperture | |5 is | |1 also | |0 helpful | in |4 blurring | out |0 unwanted | |2 background | |2 elements | .
|3 I | |5 've | |4 had | |6 a | |0 few | |0 great | |2 shots | |4 ruined | |3 myself | because |3 there | |4 was | |3 something | in |6 the | |2 background | |3 I | |5 did | n't |4 notice | |1 at | |1 first | .
|3 what | |5 are | |6 some | |0 unique | |2 customs | in |7 ireland | ?
|1 As | |1 far | ask |3 I | |5 ’m | |0 aware | |3 our | |1 most | |0 unique | |2 custom | |5 would | |5 be | |6 the | “ |2 Country | |2 Wake | ” .
In |6 all | |3 my | |2 travels | |3 I | |5 ’ve | |1 never | |4 seen | |3 anything | like |3 it | and |5 am | |1 often | |4 met | with |6 an | |0 odd | |2 look | |1 when | |3 I | |4 explain | |3 them | to |2 foreigners | .
"After |6 a | |2 person | |4 dies | , |3 their | |2 remains | |5 are | “ |4 waked | ” in |3 their | |2 home | for |1 roughly | 2 - 3 |2 days | ."
"In |6 this | |2 time | |2 visitors | |5 will | |4 come | to |6 the | |2 house | , |4 pay | |3 their | |2 respects | to |6 the | |0 desisted | and |3 their | |2 family | and |4 have | |6 a | |2 couple | of |2 cups | of |2 tea | with |6 a | |2 sandwich | or |6 a | |2 bun | ."
|6 The | |2 wake | |1 also | |4 included | |6 the | |2 night | |2 sit | |1 were | |2 friends | and |2 family | |4 sit | up through |6 the | |2 night | with |6 the | |2 remains | .
|2 Wakes | |5 are | |0 common | both |1 north | and |1 south | of |6 the | |2 boarder | with |7 Protestants | and |7 Catholics | |1 alike | .
But |1 only | |1 really | in |6 the | |2 countryside | .
"|6 The | |0 only | |0 notable | |2 difference | |3 I | |5 have | |4 noticed | |4 is | that in |6 the | |2 south | of |7 Ireland | one |2 night | of |6 the | |2 wake | |5 is | |1 often | |4 held | in |6 the | |2 chapel | |6 the | |2 night | before |6 the | |2 funeral | , |6 this | |2 tradition | |4 started | after |6 the | |0 civil | |2 war | ."
|6 Another | |0 unique | |2 custom | ( and |6 a | |4 dying | |2 one | at |3 that | ) |5 is | |6 the | |7 Pioneers | .
"|6 The | |7 Pioneers | |5 was | |6 an | |2 organization | |4 started | at |6 the | |2 end | of |6 the | |0 19th | |2 century | |3 which | |4 pushed | and |4 supported | |6 the | |2 ideal | of |2 temperance | ( |4 abstaining | from |1 alcohol | ) , in |6 an | |2 attempt | to |4 deal | with |6 the | |0 massive | |2 issue | of |2 alcoholism | |3 that | |7 Ireland | |5 was | |4 gripped | by ."
"|7 Pioneers | |4 take | |6 a | |2 pledge | to |4 remain | |0 tee | - |0 total | and at |6 the | |2 hight | of |6 the | |2 organization | |2 popularity | , |4 had | |6 an | |4 estimated | two million |2 members | |1 even | |4 filling | |7 Croke | |7 Park | on |6 the | |0 25th | |2 anniversary | ."
|3 I | my |3 self | |5 am | one but |4 appreciate | that |6 the | |2 organization | |5 is | |0 unlikely | to |4 make | into |6 the | |0 22nd | |2 century | .
|6 The | |7 Orange | |7 Order | and |6 the | |2 12th | of |7 July | |7 Marches | |5 would | |5 be | |4 argued | by |6 some | not to |5 be | |6 an | |0 Irish | |2 custom | but |1 unarguable | |4 ticks | |6 every | |2 criteria | to |5 be | |4 considered | one .
|6 The | |2 marches | on |6 the | |2 12th | of |7 July | |5 are | |1 only | |1 really | |4 attended | by |7 protestants | in |6 the | |7 Ulster | but in |2 spite | of |3 the | |5 are | |6 the | |0 largest | |4 attended | |2 paraded | in |7 Ireland | .
|2 Barn | |2 brack | and |6 the | |2 ring | .
"|6 the | |0 irish | |2 customs | |3 we | |4 have | in |3 our | |2 family | |4 are | ; |3 we | |4 make | |2 sinnel | |2 cake | for |7 easter | , |2 barn | |2 brack | and |2 col | - |2 cannon | for |7 Halloween | ."
|7 christmas | |2 cake | for |7 christmas | |2 day | .
|5 Do | |2 animals | |4 see | |2 images | on |6 a | |2 TV | |2 screen | like |2 humans | |4 do | ?
|5 Do | |2 animals | |4 see | |2 images | on |6 a | |2 TV | |2 screen | like |2 humans | |4 do | ?
"|3 I | |5 'm | |0 unsure | of |3 this | , because |1 once | |3 I | |4 watched | |6 a | |0 commercial | of |2 cat | |2 food | with |3 my | |2 cat | and |3 she | |5 did | n't |4 react | to |4 seeing | |6 another | |2 cat | on |2 TV | ."
"|3 I | |4 heard | that |6 a | |2 company | ( |1 here | |5 is | |6 a | |2 link | : http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html ) |5 is | |4 trying | to |4 make | |6 a | |2 dog | |2 food | |2 commercial | |4 aimed | at |2 dogs | , |0 complete | with |0 squeaky | |2 chew | - |2 toy | |2 sounds | , and |0 high | |4 pitched | |2 sounds | |3 that | |4 humans | |5 ca | n't |4 hear | ."
"|1 As | |1 far | as |3 I | |4 understand | , |6 this | |2 ad | |5 will | |4 get | |1 dogs | |0 excited | , but |3 my | |2 question | |4 is | : |5 Can | |2 dogs | |1 actually | |4 see | |6 the | |2 images | |4 featured | in |6 the | |2 advert | like |2 humans | ?"
"|1 Also | , |5 can | |2 animals | |4 remember | |2 images | on |2 TV | like |3 us | , |2 humans | ?"
"If |1 so | , |1 then | |5 does | |3 that | |4 mean | that if |3 you | |4 watched | |6 a | |0 scary | |2 movie | and |3 your | |2 dog | / |2 cat | / |2 parrot | |5 was | in |6 the | |0 same | |2 room | as |3 you | |3 they | |5 will | |1 also | |4 get | |0 scared | ?"
"|3 I | |5 would | n't |4 know | -- |3 I | |5 do | n't |1 particularly | |4 like | |0 scary | |2 movies | , and |3 I | |5 have | n't |4 tried | |3 this | with |3 my | |2 pet | ."
"|1 Although | , |3 I | |5 do | n't |4 think | that |0 scary | |2 movies | |5 will | |4 affect | |2 pets | for |6 a | |0 long | |2 time | ; |3 I | |5 am | |0 sure | |3 they | |5 'll | |4 forget | |1 sometime | -- or |5 am | |3 I | |0 wrong | ?"
|1 So | |3 what | about |2 T.V. | ?
|5 Do | |2 dogs | |4 enjoy | |4 watching | |2 T.V. | ?
"Well , |2 T.V. | |5 is | |6 a | |2 series | of |4 flickering | |2 pictures | |3 that | |5 are | |4 streamed | |1 together | to |4 make | |6 a | |4 moving | |2 picture | ."
"|6 The | |2 pictures | |5 are | |4 broadcast | at |6 a | |2 rate | of |1 about | 60 |2 Hz | , |3 which | |5 is | |1 how | |0 fast | |3 they | |4 need | to |4 move | for |3 us | to |4 see | |3 them | as |6 a | |4 moving | , |0 flawless | |2 picture | ."
"To |6 a | |2 dog | , |4 watching | |2 T.V. | |5 is | |6 a | |2 lot | like |4 watching | |6 and | |0 old | |0 scratchy | |0 silent | |2 film | because |3 their | |2 flicker | |2 fusion | |4 seems | to |4 occur | at |6 a | |2 rate | of 70 to 80 |2 Hz | ."
|1 So | |3 they | |4 see | |6 the | |2 pictures | |4 flicker | |1 slower | and there |1 for | |3 it | |4 seems | |0 choppy | to |3 them | .
"|1 So | |2 chances | |4 are | that if |3 your | |2 dog | |4 likes | to |4 watch | |2 T.V. | , |3 it | |5 ’s | |1 probably | because of |6 the | |2 sounds | ."
"|4 Hearing | |5 is | |6 a | |2 dog | ’s |0 secondary | |2 sense | , and |3 I | |5 will | |4 discuss | |3 that | in |6 another | |2 blog | |2 entery | ."
Yes |3 they | |4 do | .
|3 i | |5 m | |1 pretty | |0 sure | that |3 they | |5 do | |4 see | |2 things | on |6 the | |2 tv | |2 screen | because |3 my | |2 cat | |4 chases | |2 things | around |6 the | |2 tv | |2 screen |
|1 How | |0 much | |5 should | |3 I | |5 be | |4 looking | at for |2 horse | |2 transportation | ?
"|3 I | |4 need | one |2 horse | |4 transported | to |2 shows | throughout |6 the | 2012 |2 show | |2 season | , and |6 the | |2 location | |5 is | |1 about | 3 |2 hours | |1 away | from |1 where | |3 I | |4 live | ."
"|6 The | |2 place | |1 where | |3 I | |5 'm | |4 boarding | |5 is | not |0 likely | to |4 want | to |4 take | |3 me | |1 this | |1 far | , and |3 I | |5 do | not |4 have | |6 any | |2 ways | of |4 hauling | |3 him | |3 myself | ."
|1 So | |3 I | |4 want | to |4 hire | |3 someone | ( or |0 multiple | |2 people | ) to |4 transport | |3 me | to |6 these | |2 shows | .
"If |3 they | |4 ask | |1 how | |0 much | |3 I | |5 'm | |0 willing | to |4 pay | , |3 what | |5 is | |6 a | |0 good | |2 price | |2 range | ?"
|3 I | |4 saw | |6 a | |2 site | |3 that | |4 charges | $ 0.70 per |2 mile | .
|5 Is | |3 that | |0 reasonable | ?
"|0 Impossible | to |4 say | , but |3 I | |4 guess | |3 you | |5 would | |4 have | to |4 work | out |2 fuel | |2 consumption | for |6 the | |0 particular | |2 vehicle | |3 that | |3 they | |5 are | |4 using | and |4 pay | |6 a | |2 proportion | of |3 that | , and |6 some | on |2 top | for |6 the | |2 driver | 's |2 time | and |2 effort | , unless |3 you | |5 are | |0 able | to |4 share | |2 transport | with |6 another | or |0 more | , |3 that | |5 would | |4 keep | |6 the | |2 costs | |1 down | ."
|4 Remember | that |3 you | |4 get | |3 what | |3 you | |4 pay | for .
"Three |2 hours | |5 is | n't |0 far | , but |3 you | |5 are | |4 doing | |0 multiple | |2 shows | ."
"|6 Some | |2 people | |5 are | |0 willing | to |4 take | |3 your | |2 horse | , but |3 they | |1 really | |4 have | |0 old | |2 trailers | |3 that | |5 are | not |6 the | |0 safest | in |6 the | |2 world | ."
"|4 Rusted | , |4 torn | |2 corners | in |6 the | |2 stalls | , |0 unhealthy | |2 air | , |0 straight | |2 load | |1 instead | of |0 slant | |2 load | |5 can | |1 all | |4 make | |4 travelling | |0 hard | , if |1 not | |1 downright | |0 dangerous | , on |3 your | |2 horse | ."

"( |6 The | |2 rabbit | |2 hutch | |5 would | |4 have | |6 an | |2 opening | |1 only | |0 big | |0 enough | for |6 the | |2 rabbit | , |6 the | |2 chickens | |5 would | not |5 be | |0 able | to |4 get | to |6 the | |2 rabbit | |2 food | ) |1 Also | , |5 is | |3 it | |0 okay | if |6 the | |2 rabbit | |1 occasionally | |4 sneaks | |6 a | |0 few | |2 bites | of |2 chicken | |2 feed | ?"

|3 I | |1 just | |4 wan | na |4 make | |0 sure | :) |2 Thank | !
"Yes , but |5 be | |0 sure | that |3 your | |2 chickens | |5 are | |1 all | |2 hens | ( |3 I | |4 mean | |1 not | |2 roosters | ) , |2 Roosters | |5 may | |4 attack | |2 rabbits | or |3 anything | |3 they | |4 see | |4 moving | , |1 so | |5 be | |0 aware | of |3 that | , |2 hens | |5 are | |0 friendly | with |1 almost | |6 all | |2 kinds | of |2 pets | !"

|5 Be | |0 sure | |1 not | to |4 feed | |3 your | |2 rabbits | |0 non-veg | |2 items | !
"|3 You | |4 said | |3 they | |4 live | in |0 different | |2 cages | and |3 they | |5 are | |0 free | in |2 day | , |1 so | |6 no | |2 problem | , |5 do | n't |4 put | |6 both | of |3 them | in one |2 cage | because |2 rabbits | |2 bedding | |5 is | |0 different | than |3 that | of |2 hens | , |0 wet | |2 bedding | |5 can | |4 cause | |2 diseases | in |3 them | !"
"|1 So | , |5 do | n't |4 put | |6 both | of |3 them | in one |2 cage | ."
|0 Good | |2 luck | !
yea |3 i | |4 guess | but |2 rabbits | |5 a | |1 easily | |4 escape | |6 a | |2 pen | or |6 another | |2 rabbit | |5 could | |4 get | in |1 there | and |6 that | |2 rabbit | |5 could | |5 be | |6 the | |0 opposite | |2 gender | .
|1 So | |5 be | |1 very | |0 careful | and |6 some | |2 feeds | |5 could | |5 be | |0 toxic | to |2 rabbits | and |0 safe | for |2 chickens | .
|2 Rabbits | |5 do | |4 burrow | |1 also | |1 so | |5 do | n't |5 be | |0 surprised | if |2 chicken | |5 are | |4 falling | into |2 holes | .
|2 rabbits | |5 are | |0 delicate | and |5 can | |4 get | |2 diseases | |1 so | |4 watch | out for |3 that | .
|4 melting | |2 brass | |5 did | not |4 work | ?
|3 my | |2 friends | and |3 I | |5 are | |4 trying | to |4 melt | |2 bras | to |4 make | |6 some | |0 little | |2 figures | .

|3 what | |5 am | |3 I | |4 doing | |1 wrong |
"|3 I | |5 would | |4 recommend | to |4 start | with |3 something | |1 more | |0 simple | like |2 tin | , |2 pewter | , |2 aluminum | or |2 zinc | , |3 they | |6 all | |4 have | |6 a | |1 much | |1 more | |0 reasonable | |2 melting | |2 point | ."
|3 I | |5 'll | |1 just | |4 echo | |6 both | |0 other | |2 answers | .
|0 Molten | |2 brass | |5 is | |1 damn | |0 hot | and |1 usually | |3 it | |5 's | |4 pressurized | |2 gas | and |4 forced | |2 air | or |2 oxygen | .
"|1 Even | if |3 you | |5 did | |4 melt | |3 it | , |3 I | |4 doubt | |3 you | |4 foresaw | |6 the | |2 issues | of |4 handling | |3 it | and |4 pouring | |3 it | ."

|2 Brass | |4 has | |6 an | |1 even | |0 higher | |2 melting | |2 point | than |2 bronze | and |3 I | |5 would | |4 think | |3 your | |2 charcoal | |1 just | |5 does | n't |4 get | |0 hot | |0 enough | .

"|4 Offer | to |4 do | |0 extra | |2 chores | , |4 ask | for |3 your | |2 pet | as |6 a | |2 reward | for |0 good | |2 grades | , |3 something | like |3 that | ."
4 . |4 Play | |6 the | |2 sympathy | |2 card | .
"If |3 you | |5 can | |4 find | |6 a | |2 pet | at |6 a | |2 shelter | , or |3 that | |6 a | |2 friend | |4 needs | to |4 get | |0 rid | of because |3 they | |5 're | |4 moving | or |6 whatever | , |3 you | |5 might | |5 be | |0 able | to |4 talk | |3 your | |2 parents | into "" |4 giving | |3 it | |6 a | |0 good | |2 home | "" |1 where | |3 you | |5 might | not |5 be | |0 able | to |4 talk | |3 them | into |4 buying | |6 a | |0 new | |2 pet | ."
On |6 the | |2 fear | |2 angle | -- |4 talk | |3 her | into |4 coming | to |6 the | |2 pet | |2 store | with |3 you | .
"Once |3 you | |5 're | |1 there | , |4 ask | if |3 you | |5 can | |4 hold | |6 a | |2 ball | |2 python | ."

"|3 My | |2 Snake | 's |2 meal | |5 is | |1 TOO | |0 big | , |3 what | |5 can | |3 I | |4 do | ?"
|1 Just | |2 today | |3 I | |4 bought | |6 a | |2 medium | |2 rat | for |3 my | |0 beloved | |2 Ball | |2 Python | |7 Salazar | ( |4 name | after |7 Harry | |7 Potter | ) .
|0 Last | |2 time | |3 I | |4 got | |6 a | |2 medium | |2 rat | |3 it | |5 was | |6 a | |2 girl | and |3 my | |2 snake | |4 handled | |3 her | |1 easily | .
"But |2 today | , |3 I | |4 got | |6 a | |2 boy | and |4 realized | that |3 he | |5 is | |0 HUGE | !"
|3 I | |1 really | |5 do | |4 love | |3 my | |2 snake | cause |3 she | |5 is | |1 actually | |6 an | |0 affectionate | |0 cold | - |4 blooded | |2 creature | .
"|1 So | |3 my | |0 true | |2 question | |4 comes | to |3 this | , |1 how | |5 can | |3 I | |4 knock | |6 the | |2 rat | out ?"
"If |3 I | |4 threw | |3 him | against |6 a | |2 wall | and |1 still | |0 conscious | |3 he | |5 will | |4 run | |1 away | , |5 do | |3 I | |4 hang | |3 him | by |6 the | |2 tail | so |6 the | |2 blood | |5 can | |4 flush | into |3 his | |2 skull | ?"
"|3 I | |1 really | |5 do | |4 need | |2 answers | and |2 advice | , and |1 NOT | |0 INSULTING | |2 ANSWERS | !!"
LIKE |1 SERIOUSLY | !! >:(
|0 Best | |2 answer | |5 shall | |4 receive | |2 points | :)
"|3 iw | |5 ould | |1 just | |4 stick | |3 him | in |6 the | |2 tank | and |4 let | |3 your | |2 snake | |4 have | |6 a | |0 nice | |2 hunt | for |1 once | , |2 snakes | |2 jaws | |4 detach | for |6 this | |2 sort | of |6 this | |2 thing | , |1 so | |1 why | not |4 give | |3 her | |6 a | |0 good | |2 hunt | , but if |3 you | |5 do | |4 want | |3 him | |4 knock | |3 him | |3 i | |5 d | |1 just | |4 throw | |3 him | against |6 the | |2 wall | or |3 something | ,, lol |3 i | |5 do | nt |4 know | , |3 i | |4 agree | with |3 you | |1 though | |4 throw | |3 him | , haha"
"Ok |1 so | if |3 youre | |2 snake | |5 will | |4 take | |0 pre-killed | , |3 you | |5 can | "" |4 gas | |3 it | "" ."
|1 Just | |4 put | |6 the | |2 rat | in |6 a | |4 sealed | |2 tupperwear | |2 container | with |6 no | |2 airholes | and |4 wait | until |3 it | |4 passes | out and |4 dies | and |1 then | |4 feed | |3 it | .
"If |3 it | |5 wo | n't |4 take | |0 pre-killed | and |3 you | |1 usually | |4 feed | |0 live | |1 then | |3 you | |5 could | |4 hold | |6 the | |2 rat | by |6 the | |2 tail | and |4 whack | |3 it | against |6 a | |0 hard | |2 surface | , like |6 a | |2 refrigerator | or |2 wall | ."
|3 I | |5 do | n't |4 like | |6 that | |2 option | |1 though | - |3 I | |4 think | |3 it | |5 's | |1 pretty | |0 cruel | and I'd |1 not | |4 done | |1 properly | |3 you | |5 'll | |4 end | up |1 really | |4 hurting | |6 the | |2 rat | but not |4 stunning | |3 him | |1 enough | to |4 stop | |0 possible | |2 injury | to |3 your | |2 snake | .
|3 I | |5 would | |4 do | |6 the | |2 tupperwear | |2 idea | |1 TBH | - |0 easiest | and |1 most | |0 humane | .
"|3 You | |5 could | |1 also | |1 just | |4 wait | until |6 the | |2 rat | |4 passes | out for |1 about | 1 |2 minute | and |1 them | |4 feed | |3 it | - at |6 this | |2 point | , |3 it | |5 could | |1 still | |4 have | |6 a | |2 bit | of |6 a | |2 heart | |2 beat | and |5 be | |1 slightly | |1 still | |0 alive | ."
And |1 also | |1 maybe | |4 try | |4 holding | |6 the | |2 rat | in |2 feeding | |2 prongs | so |3 your | |2 snake | |5 can | |4 get | |6 a | |0 good | |2 hold | and |2 grip | on |3 his | |2 prey | .
|0 Good | |2 luck | !
|1 Just | |3 my | |2 opinion | |1 here | - |6 no | |2 judgement | - |4 getting | |3 your | |2 snake | on |4 frozen | / |4 thawed | |5 will | |4 prove | to |5 be | |1 much | |0 easier | for |3 you | and |0 safer | for |3 your | |2 snake | in |6 the | |0 long | |2 run | .
|3 My | |2 opinion | - |4 take | |3 it | for |3 what | |3 it | |5 's | |0 worth | … :-)

|6 The | |0 only | |2 downside | |4 is | |3 they | |5 should | |5 be | |4 kept | in |2 pairs | or |2 trios | and |4 require | |6 a | |1 pretty | |0 large | |2 habitat | .
"|3 That | |4 means | |2 expense | , |2 space | , and |3 they | |4 require | |0 weekly | |2 cage | |2 cleaning | ."

|3 I | |5 've | |1 never | |4 met | |6 a | |2 hamster | |3 that | |5 did | n't |4 bite | |3 me | .
|1 Never | |4 had | / |4 handled | |6 a | |2 Degu | .
|4 Get | |6 a | |2 guinea | |2 pig | .
|3 We | |4 have | two .
|3 They | |5 are | |0 social | and |4 like | to |5 be | |4 handled | .
|3 You | |4 have | to |4 have | two because |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 do | |1 well | |1 alone | .
|4 Make | |0 certain | |3 you | |4 get | two |2 females | .
Two |2 males | |5 can | |4 fight | and |3 you | |1 definitely | |5 do | n't |4 want | |2 babies | !!
|2 Guinea | |2 pigs | ( |1 also | |4 called | |2 cavies | ) |5 are | |0 gentle | |2 creatures | and |5 are | |0 awake | during |6 the | |2 day | and |4 sleep | at |2 night | .
|3 They | |5 will | |4 whistle | |1 when | |3 they | |4 hear | |3 you | as |6 an | |2 encouragement | for |3 you | to |4 give | |3 them | |6 a | |2 treat | like |2 leaf | |2 lettuce | .

|4 Fostering | 6 |2 week | |0 old | |2 kittens | and |4 HATING | |3 IT | !
|4 Need | |2 Advice | !?
"|3 I | |4 wanted | to |4 volunteer | and |4 help | |2 animals | , and |4 decided | to |4 try | |4 fostering | |2 kittens | ."
|3 This | |5 is | |3 my | |0 first | |2 experience | and |3 I | |4 have | two six |2 week | |0 old | |2 kittens | |1 right | |1 now | and |5 am | at |3 my | |2 wit | s |2 end | .
|3 I | |5 do | not |4 want | to |4 have | to |4 bring | |3 them | back before |3 they | |5 are | eight |2 weeks | |0 old | but |3 they | |5 are | |4 ruining | |3 my | |2 apartment | .
"|3 They | |4 track | |2 poop | |1 everywhere | ( |1 most | |1 disgustingly | |3 my | |2 bed | .... ) , and |5 am | |1 constantly | |4 trying | to |4 climb | |1 up | |3 everything | , |4 including | |3 my | |0 bare | |2 legs | !"
|3 My | |2 legs | and |2 hands | |5 are | |1 just | |0 full | of |2 scratches | .
"|3 I | |4 realize | |3 they | |5 are | |0 young | and that |2 cats | |5 do | |4 climb | , but |3 this | |5 is | |1 just | |0 ridiculous | ."
|3 My | |2 apartment | |1 also | |4 smells | |0 repulsive | |1 even | though |3 I | |5 am | |4 cleaning | out |3 their | |2 litter | |2 box | |1 at | |1 least | |1 once | |6 a | |2 day | if |1 not | |1 twice | .
|6 Any | |2 suggestions | and |0 helpful | |2 hints | to |4 make | |3 this | |6 a | |1 more | |0 positive | |2 experience | |5 would | |5 be | |1 extremely | |4 appreciated | .
|3 That | |5 's | |1 kind | |1 of | |6 the | |2 way | |3 it | |4 goes | .. lol .
|4 Limit | |3 them | to one |2 room | with |0 easy | to |4 clean | |2 flooring | .
"If |3 you | |4 have | |4 limited | |2 options | , |4 try | |6 the | |2 bathroom | ."
|4 Make | |0 sure | |3 there | |4 are | |2 plenty | of |2 litter | |2 boxes | |3 that | |5 are | |4 cleaned | |1 often | .
"|4 Depending | on |6 the | |2 batch | of |2 kittens | , |3 I | |5 will | |1 often | |4 have | |1 as | |0 many | as one per |2 kitten | ."
|3 They | |5 can | |4 produce | |6 a | |2 lot | of |2 waste | and |1 even | |4 scooping | |1 twice | |6 a | |2 day | |3 they | |5 can | |4 get | |0 messy | .
For |6 some | |2 reason | |3 it | |4 takes | |3 them | |1 awhile | to |4 learn | |1 not | to |4 step | in |2 poop | .
"|1 Also | if |3 they | |4 have | |2 diarrhea | , |4 check | in with |3 your | |2 foster | |2 coordinator | ."
|3 They | |5 made | |4 need | |2 medication | or |2 deworming | or |3 something | .
|3 They | |5 are | |4 testing | out |3 their | |2 claws | and |2 teeth | .
To |6 some | |2 degree | |3 you | |5 can | / |5 should | |4 help | |4 teach | |3 them | |1 not | to |4 use | |3 their | |2 teeth | and |2 claws | |1 inappropriately | .
"But in |6 the | |2 meantime | , |1 highly | |4 recommend | |2 jeans | and |0 long | |2 sleeves | |2 anytime | |3 you | |5 'll | |5 be | |4 interacting | with |6 the | |2 kittens | ."
|1 Then | |4 take | |2 care | of |3 yourself | .
|4 Get | |2 plenty | of |2 sleep | and |4 make | |0 sure | |3 you | |4 take | |2 time | |1 out | to |4 do | |6 some | |2 things | |3 you | |4 enjoy | .
|4 Try | |4 visiting | |6 the | |2 kittens | |6 a | |0 few | |2 times | |6 a | |2 day | for |0 short | |2 periods | of |2 time | .
|4 Try | to |4 go | in |1 there | with |6 the | |0 right | |2 frame | of |2 mind | and |4 enjoy | |3 them | for |3 what | |3 they | |4 are | .
"If |3 you | |1 still | |5 do | n't |4 enjoy | |6 the | |2 kittens | , |4 see | |6 what | |0 other | |2 opportunities | |5 are | |0 available | ."
"|3 They | |5 may | |4 need | |2 foster | |2 homes | for |0 adult | |2 cats | in |0 different | |2 situations | .. |0 sick | , |4 recovering | from |2 surgery | , |4 need | |6 a | |0 little | |2 socialization | , etc ."
|3 I | |4 find | |6 the | |2 adults | |5 are | |1 much | |0 easier | .
"|1 Generally | |3 they | |5 're | not |4 clawing | and |4 biting | , |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 make | |1 nearly | |1 as | |0 much | |2 mess | , |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 need | |1 nearly | |1 as | |0 much | |2 litterbox | |2 scooping | , etc :)"
|4 Decide | |2 volunteering | |5 is | not |3 your | |2 thing | and |4 give | |3 them | back !
And |4 do | |0 more | |2 research | before |3 you | |4 agree | |0 next | |2 time | ;-)
|4 Take | |6 the | |2 kittens | |1 back | to |6 the | |2 shelter | .
"|1 Maybe | |4 do | |2 volunteer | |2 work | at |6 the | |0 humane | |2 society | , |4 walk | |2 dogs | , |4 groom | |6 the | |2 animals | etc ."

|4 including | |2 fees | and |2 forms |
|3 It | |4 depends | on if |3 you | |1 ever | |4 registered | |6 the | |2 birth | .
"|6 Some | |2 places | |4 do | |6 the | |2 registration | |1 right | at |6 the | |2 hospital | .... in |6 some | |0 smaller | |2 places | , |3 you | |4 need | to |4 register | |3 your | |2 child | 's |2 birth | at |6 the | |2 town | |2 hall | / |2 registrar | 's |2 office | ."
|3 My | |0 first | three |2 children | |5 were | |4 born | in |0 Southern | |7 Ontario | |2 cities | .

"|3 I | |4 had | to |4 call | |6 the | |7 Office | of |6 the | |7 Registrar | |7 General | in |7 Thunder | |7 Bay | , |4 have | |2 copies | of |6 the | |0 delayed | |2 registration | |2 form | |4 mailed | |1 out | to |3 me | , as |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 have | |6 an | |0 online | |2 area | for |3 it | |1 yet | , |4 fill | |3 those | out , |4 send | |3 them | |1 away | , |1 then | |4 apply | for |3 his | |2 birth | |2 certificate | ."

For $ 56 |3 you | |5 can | |1 even | |4 have | |3 it | |4 expedited | and |5 will | |4 get | in three |2 business | |2 days | or |3 your | |2 money | |1 back | .

|3 My | |2 parents | |5 did | n't |4 send | for |3 my | |2 birth | |2 certificate | until |3 I | |5 was | 16 and |4 needed | |3 it | for |2 summer | |2 employment | .
|3 It | |5 was | |6 no | |2 problem | to |4 get | |4 PROVIDED | |6 the | |2 birth | |5 was | |4 registered | in |6 the | |0 first | |2 place | .
|3 I | |4 add | |3 that | |1 in | because |3 there | |5 have | |4 been | |6 some | |2 people | |3 who | |5 have | |4 tried | to |4 claim | |2 citizenship | by |4 sending | for |3 their | |2 birth | |2 certificate | |1 when | |3 they | |5 were | |1 never | |1 really | |4 born | in |7 Canada | or to |0 Canadian | |2 parents | .

"|2 Itinerary | |6 Both | |2 ships | |4 go | to |0 Caribbean | |2 Islands | like |7 Jamaica | , |7 Grand | |7 Cayman | , |7 Cozumel | , |7 St. | |7 Thomas | , |6 the | |7 Bahamas | and |7 St. | |7 Martin | / |7 St. | |7 Maarten | ."

|3 We | |4 loved | |0 most | of |6 the | |2 locations | |3 that | |6 both | of |6 the | |2 ships | |4 visited | and |5 do | n't |4 believe | that |3 this | |5 should | |5 be | |6 a | |0 distinguishing | |2 factor | on |4 deciding | between |6 the | |2 cruise | |2 lines | .
|2 Shows | |6 Each | |2 night | |3 there | |4 are | |6 a | |2 variety | of |2 shows | .
|1 Usually | |3 you | |4 have | |6 the | |0 main | |2 show | and |6 some | |2 type | of |2 entertainment | |1 before | and |1 perhaps | |1 afterward | .
|3 We | |4 felt | that |6 the | |0 main | |2 shows | on |6 the | |7 Mariner | of |6 the | |7 Seas | |5 were | |0 better | .

|2 Dining | |2 Room | |3 We | |4 enjoyed | |6 the | |2 atmosphere | of |6 both | |2 dining | |2 rooms | on |6 the | |7 Liberty | and |7 Mariner | of |6 the | |7 Seas | .

"|3 We | |4 had | |6 a | |1 slightly | |0 better | |2 experience | on |6 the | |7 Liberty | , but |4 feel | that |6 both | |2 crews | |4 did | |6 an | |0 excellent | |2 job | and that |3 this | |5 should | not |5 be | |6 a | |0 distinguishing | |2 factor | on |4 choosing | |6 a | |2 cruise | ."

|3 They | |6 both | |4 had | |2 pools | for |2 kids | and |2 adults | .

|3 We | |5 are | |1 currently | |4 living | |6 a | |2 mile | from |6 the | |2 town | in |6 a | |2 house | |4 surrounded | by |2 fields | but |6 the | |0 new | |2 house | |5 is | beside |6 a | |0 busy | |2 road | .
|3 We | |5 have | |4 had | |6 the | |2 cat | for 10 |2 years | and |5 do | nt |4 want | to |4 leave | |3 it | .
|1 How | |5 could | |3 we | |4 make | |3 it | |4 settle | in |6 a | |0 new | |2 house | .
|3 you | |5 are | not |1 just | |4 moving | |2 house | - |3 your | |2 cat | |5 is | |4 losing | |3 his | |2 territory | .
"|2 territory | |5 is | |1 very | |0 important | to |2 cats | , and |3 they | |5 are | |1 very | |0 nervous | |1 when | |3 they | |4 go | into |6 a | |0 new | |2 place | - |6 a | |0 new | |2 house | |5 could | |5 be | |0 full | of |2 predators | , or |0 unknown | |2 menaces | - well |1 at | |1 least | |3 he | |4 thinks | |1 so | ."
"|3 you | |5 will | |4 need | to |4 give | |3 him | |1 only | |6 a | |0 small | |2 place | to |4 explore | , so |3 he | |5 can | |4 make | |3 it | |3 his | |2 territory | , and |4 feel | |0 safe | |1 there | ."
"|1 then | , |3 he | |5 can | |4 have | |6 a | |2 place | to |4 retreat | to |1 when | |3 he | |4 feels | |0 scared | ."
"|3 you | |5 will | |4 need | to |4 get | |3 his | |2 box | and |2 bowls | , and |6 whatever | |2 blanket | and |2 toys | |5 are | |3 his | , and |4 smell | like |2 home | , and |4 put | |3 him | in |6 a | |2 room | ."
"|6 the | |2 room | |3 you | |4 sleep | in |5 is | |0 best | ( |4 seeing | |3 you | |1 so | |0 relaxed | that |3 you | |5 are | |4 sleeping | |5 will | |4 send | |6 the | |2 message | that |3 everything | |5 is | |0 OK | ) , but |2 others | |5 will | |4 work | |1 just | |1 as | |1 well | ."
"|4 close | |6 the | |2 door | , and |4 keep | |3 him | in |1 there | for |6 a | |2 week | ."
"|3 he | |5 will | |4 feel | |1 much | |0 safer | in |6 that | one |2 room | , than in |6 a | |0 huge | |0 unknown | |2 house | ."
"|3 he | |5 will | |4 explore | |6 the | |2 room | , |4 mark | |3 everything | with |3 his | |2 cheek | , and |4 try | to |4 make | |3 it | |4 feel | like |3 his | |2 territory | ."
"|3 he | |5 will | |4 reassure | |3 himself | that |6 no | |0 other | |2 animal | |5 is | in |1 there | , and that |6 no | |0 other | |2 animal | |5 will | |4 come | |1 in | - |3 he | |5 is | |0 afraid | that |3 he | |5 is | in |3 someone | |0 else | 's |2 territory | |1 when | |3 he | |5 is | in |6 a | |0 new | |2 house | ."
"in |6 a | |2 week | 's |2 time | , |3 he | |5 will | |5 have | |4 made | |3 it | |3 his | , and |5 will | |5 be | |4 getting | |0 more | |0 bored | than |0 afraid | ."
"|4 let | |3 him | out for |6 half | |6 an | |2 hour | , to |4 explore | ."
|1 then | |4 put | |3 him | |1 back | |1 in | .
"|3 he | |5 will | |5 be | |4 freaked | out , |1 so | |4 going | |1 back | to |3 his | |2 territory | |5 will | |4 make | |3 him | |1 much | |0 happier | ."
"|4 extend | |6 the | |2 time | |3 he | |5 is | |1 out | |6 each | |2 day | , but for |6 the | |0 first | |2 month | , |1 always | |4 put | |3 him | in |3 his | |2 room | at |2 night | , so |3 he | |4 feels | |0 safe | to |4 sleep | ."
"|1 soon | |3 he | |5 will | |4 make | |6 the | |0 whole | |2 house | |3 his | , but |3 he | |4 needs | |6 that | one |0 safe | |2 place | to |4 start | from ."
"|4 remember | to |4 visit | with |3 him | while |3 he | |5 is | in |6 the | |2 room | , and |4 tell | |3 him | |1 how | |0 good | |3 he | |4 is | ."
"|4 remember | to |4 give | |3 him | |6 the | |2 time | |3 he | |4 needs | to |4 feel | that |6 the | |2 room | |5 is | |3 his | - |4 rush | |3 it | , and |3 he | |5 will | |5 be | |0 afraid | of |6 the | |0 whole | |2 house | for |6 a | |0 long | |2 time | ."
|3 he | |5 might | |1 even | |4 start | |4 peeing | on |2 things | in |2 fear | .
|0 good | |2 luck | with |3 your | |0 new | |2 house | and with |3 his | |0 new | |2 territory | !
|4 Let | |3 her | |4 explore | |1 when | |3 we | |4 moved | |3 my | |2 cat | |4 had | to |4 explore | |6 the | |0 entire | |2 house | before |3 she | |4 felt | |0 comfortable | .
In |2 time | |1 though | |3 she | / |3 he | |5 will | |4 adjust | . :)
|3 they | |1 just | |4 do | |3 it | on |3 their | |0 own | .
|3 I | |1 just | |4 adopted | |6 a | 2 |2 year | |0 old | |2 male | |0 German | |2 Shepherd | with |0 Major | |0 bad | |2 behaviors | ?
"|0 Last | |2 night | , |3 I | |4 adopted | |6 a | 2 |2 year | |0 old | |0 Male | |0 German | |2 Shepherd | ."
"( |3 He | |5 is | 92 |2 pounds | ) |3 He | |5 does | not |4 listen | to |6 any | |2 commands | , but |3 my | |0 major | |2 problem | |4 is | that |3 he | |5 will | not |4 go | |1 outside | on |2 command | , or |1 even | with |3 me | ."
|3 I | |5 will | |4 walk | |1 outside | and |3 he | |5 will | |4 stand | at |6 the | |2 door | and |4 stare | at |3 me | or |4 run | |1 away | .
|3 My | |0 other | |0 MAJOR | |2 problem | |4 is | that |3 he | |5 will | not |4 get | in |3 his | |2 crate | .
"|3 I | |5 will | |4 get | |6 a | |2 treat | and |4 try | to |4 get | |3 him | in |1 there | |6 that | |2 way | , |3 it | |5 wo | nt |4 work | ."

"If |3 I | |4 come | towards |3 him | , |3 he | |5 will | |4 run | |1 away | ."

and to |1 willingly | |4 go | |1 outside | ... and to |4 come | on |2 command | .

|3 I | |4 have | |6 a | 9 |2 month | |0 old | |0 German | |2 Shepherd | |3 that | |3 I | |4 raised | from |6 a | |2 puppy | .
|3 I | |4 trained | |3 her | |3 myself | .

"Yes , |2 lots | of |2 time | and |2 lots | of |2 patients | ..."
|3 I | |1 just | |5 do | nt |4 know | |1 how | to |4 do | |3 it | with |6 a | |4 grown | |2 dog | .
|3 She | |4 tosses | |3 me | around like |3 it | |5 s | |3 nothing | !
"... but |1 basically | , |3 what | |3 I | |4 do | |5 is | |6 the | |0 same | |2 thing | |3 I | |4 did | with |3 my | |2 puppy | ... |2 lots | of |2 patience | , |2 lots | of |2 time | , |2 lots | of |2 praise | , |2 lots | of |2 treats | , and |2 lots | of |2 repition | .... Right ?"
|4 Is | |3 there | |6 any | |2 tricks | |3 I | |5 could | |4 use | ?
|1 Maybe | |4 get | |6 a | |2 book | on |2 training | .
|3 You | |4 have | to |5 be | in |2 command | at |6 all | |2 times | .
|3 There | |4 are | |2 ways | to |4 get | |3 your | |0 new | |2 dog | |0 used | to |6 the | |2 crate | or |4 going | |1 out | .
|3 I | |5 would | |4 start | with |6 a | |2 leash | .
|4 Put | |6 the | |2 leash | on |6 the | |2 dog | and |1 just | |4 walk | around |6 the | |2 crate | |6 a | |0 few | |2 times | .
|1 Then | |4 take | |6 the | |2 leash | off and |4 do | |3 nothing | |0 else | but |3 that | .
|1 Later | |4 do | |3 it | |1 again | .
"|1 When | |6 the | |2 dog | |5 is | |0 ok | with |3 this | , |1 then | |4 open | |6 the | |2 door | and |4 walk | around |6 the | |2 crate | , |4 leave | |6 the | |2 door | |0 open | |6 all | |6 the | |2 time | ."
|4 Put | |3 something | |0 fun | |1 inside | .
|4 Let | |3 your | |2 dog | |4 go | |1 in | |1 when | |3 he | |4 wants | to for |6 no | |2 reason | .
|5 Do | not |4 shut | |6 the | |2 door | .
|4 Let | |3 him | |4 walk | |1 in | and |1 out | for |6 a | |0 few | |2 days | .
At |6 some | |2 point | |3 he | |5 will | |4 feel | |0 ok | with |3 this | and |3 you | |5 can | |1 then | |4 close | |6 the | |2 door | but not for |1 long | |1 at | |1 all | .
|4 Open | |6 the | |2 door | and |4 let | |3 him | out and |4 see | |1 how | |3 he | |4 acts | .
"If |3 you | |4 push | |3 it | , |3 it | |5 will | |1 never | |4 work | ."
"With |4 going | |1 outside | , |4 put | |6 the | |2 leash | on and |1 just | |4 take | |3 him | for |6 a | |2 walk | ."
|3 He | |5 will | |4 learn | to |1 really | |4 like | |3 this | .
|2 Potty | |1 outside | |5 will | |4 come | at |6 some | |2 point | .
|4 Try | |2 obedience | |2 classes | .
"|4 Have | |2 patience | with |3 him | , |3 you | |1 just | |4 got | |3 him | and |3 who | |4 knows | |1 how | |3 he | |5 was | |4 treated | before |3 you | |4 brought | |3 him | |1 home | ."

To |4 answer | |3 your | |2 questions | in |2 order | :
"1 ) |3 It | |5 is | not |0 normal | for |2 dogs | to |5 be | |4 vomiting | , |1 much | |1 less | to |4 have | |2 blood | in |3 it | ."
"|1 However | , if |3 they | |5 have | |5 been | |4 vomiting | |0 numerous | |2 times | , |1 then | |6 the | |2 blood | |5 could | |5 be | due to |2 irritation | of |6 the | |2 stomach | and |2 intestines | ."
"|3 He | |5 could | |1 also | |4 have | |7 Parvovirus | , |6 a | |2 GI | |0 foreign | |2 body | , or |6 any | |2 number | of |2 things | ."
|5 Did | |3 your | |2 vet | |4 take | |2 radiographs | ( |2 x | - |2 rays | ) ?
2 ) |3 Your | |2 vet | |5 would | not |4 prescribe | |3 them | if |3 they | |5 did | n't |4 think | |3 it | |5 would | |5 be | |0 helpful | .
"3 ) If |3 he | |4 shows | |6 no | |2 interest | in |2 water | , |1 then | |4 take | |3 him | |1 back | to |3 your | |2 vet | ."
|3 It | |5 could | |5 be | due to |2 nausea | or |6 any | |2 number | of |2 things | .
|3 He | |5 could | |4 become | |0 severly | |0 dehydrated | ( |1 especially | if |3 he | |4 continues | to |4 vomit | and |4 have | |2 diarrhea | ) .
"From |1 there | |3 you | |4 end | up with |2 electrolyte | |2 imbalances | , |3 which | |5 can | |4 lead | to |2 heart | and |2 kidney | |2 problems | ."
"And |5 being | |0 dehydrated | , |4 vomiting | , and |4 having | |2 diarrhea | |1 just | |5 does | n't |4 feel | |0 good | ."
4 ) |4 Call | |3 your | |2 vet | .
"|3 They | |5 should | |5 have | |4 discussed | |6 a | |0 bland | |2 diet | with |3 you | , |4 including | |6 the | |2 frequency | of |2 feeding | and |1 how | |0 much | to |4 feed | at |6 each | |2 sitting | ."
"|3 It | |4 sounds | like |3 your | |2 dog | |5 may | |4 benefit | from |5 being | |4 hospitalized | , and |4 put | on |2 IV | |2 fluids | to |4 help | |3 his | |2 hydration | , |4 administer | |6 the | |2 antibiotics | |2 IV | , and to |4 ensure | that |3 he | |4 starts | to |4 recover | ."
|3 You | |5 should | |1 ABSOLUTELY | |4 call | |3 your | |2 veterinarian | back |1 immediately | to |4 clarify | |3 anything | |3 you | |4 have | |2 questions | about .

|4 Boiled | |0 WHITE | |2 rice | and |4 boiled | |2 chicken | |2 breast | .
|0 Bland | |2 food | .
|6 NO | |2 SPICES | !
"|3 My | |2 vet | |4 told | |3 me | |1 when | |6 a | |2 dog | |5 is | |4 vomiting | |6 a | |2 lot | , |3 it | |5 could | |5 be | |6 a | |2 sign | of |2 obstruction | ."
|5 Did | |3 they | |4 do | |6 any | |2 x | - |2 rays | ?
|3 I | |5 do | n't |4 know | if |4 vomiting | |2 blood | |5 is | |0 common | with |6 this | |2 ailment | .

"|1 However | , |3 I | |5 've | |4 read | on |6 the | |2 internet | that |6 the | |0 French | |2 dating | |2 etiquette | |5 is | |1 totally | |0 different | ."
"For |3 them | , |2 dating | |5 would | |1 normally | |4 be | |4 meeting | in |2 groups | or |2 parties | , |1 then | |4 pairing | off ."

"|3 She | |1 also | |4 seems | to |4 hate | |3 it | |1 whenever | |3 I | |4 ask | |3 her | out on |6 a | |2 date | , to |6 the | |2 point | |3 she | |4 said | |4 stop | !"
|3 My | |2 mind | |4 thinks | |3 she | |4 has | |6 no | |2 interest | in |3 me | and |1 just | |4 stringing | |3 me | |1 along | .
But |6 the | |2 articles | |3 I | |4 read | |4 seemed | to |4 say | |6 the | |0 contrary | .
|5 Have | |3 I | |1 just | |4 fallen | |2 victim | in |6 a | |0 cultural | |2 trap | ?
|3 What | |3 you | |5 have | |4 read | in |6 the | |2 internet | |5 is | |1 fairly | |0 accurate | but |1 of | |1 course | |3 it | |5 does | not |4 fit | |6 all | |2 scenarios | .
"|3 You | |5 are | not |0 French | for |6 a | |2 start | , |1 so | |6 the | "" |2 rules | "" or "" |2 customs | "" |5 may | not |4 apply | to |3 you | |1 when | |3 it | |4 comes | to |4 entering | into |6 a | |2 relationship | between |2 people | from |0 different | |2 backgrounds | ."
From |3 what | |3 you | |4 say | |6 the | |2 messages | |4 given | by |6 this | |2 girl | |5 are | |1 quite | |0 clear | .
|3 She | |5 is | not |4 stringing | |3 you | |1 along | since |3 she | |5 is | |1 actually | |4 discouraging | |3 you | and |5 is | |0 honest | |0 enough | to |4 tell | |3 you | to |4 stop | |4 asking | |3 her | out .
|3 She | |5 is | |1 just | |5 being | |0 friendly | in |0 public | because |3 she | |5 does | not |4 want | to |4 offend | |3 you | and |3 she | |4 treats | |3 you | like |6 any | |0 other | |2 friend | .
"|3 You | |4 said | |3 you | |4 liked | |3 her | and |3 she | |4 accepted | |3 it | as |6 a | |2 truth | and |1 perhaps | as |6 a | |2 compliment | , but |3 it | |5 does | not |4 mean | |3 she | |4 fancies | |3 you | or |4 wants | to |4 pair | off with |3 you | ."
"At |2 parties | |3 she | |5 does | not |4 want | to |5 be | |4 considered | in |6 any | |2 way | |4 attached | to |3 you | , |3 which | |5 is | |0 consistent | ."
"|4 Take | |6 the | |2 messages | for |3 what | |3 they | |5 are | : |3 she | |4 has | |6 no | |2 objection | in |3 you | |5 being | |2 pals | at |2 uni | , but |3 she | |5 does | not |4 want | to |4 take | |2 matters | |1 further | ."

|7 Christiane | |4 gave | |3 you | |6 a | |0 good | |2 answer | .
|3 You | |5 have | |4 fallen | in |6 a | |0 cultural | |2 misunderstanding | .
"|3 What | |3 I | |4 have | to |4 add | |4 is | that |3 it | |5 is | |0 normal | in |7 France | to |4 have | |4 mixed | |2 gender | |2 groups | of |2 friends | , |3 there | |4 's | |3 nothing | |0 unusual | in |2 boys | and |2 girls | |5 being | |1 only | |2 friends | , |3 which | |5 is | |1 obviously | |3 what | |6 this | |2 girl | |4 wants | from |3 you | ."

If |3 she | |5 is | |0 nicer | |1 when | |3 you | |5 are | |0 alone | |3 I | |5 'd | |4 say | |3 it | |4 is | because in |0 public | |2 view | |3 she | |5 is | |4 making | |0 sure | that |2 people | |5 do | not |4 think | that |3 you | |5 might | |5 be | |3 her | |2 boyfriend | .
|3 You | |5 do | |4 find | |6 the | ' |4 get | |6 the | |2 number | |4 hop | in |2 bed | with |3 her | ' but |5 be | |0 aware | that |3 they | |1 usually | |4 have | |6 a | |2 reputation | as |2 sluts | .

|3 he | |5 has | n't |4 eaten | in |6 an | |0 entire | |2 month | .
|3 i | |5 've | |1 only | |4 tried | to |4 feed | |3 him | one at |6 a | |2 time | .
"|3 he | |5 's | |1 just | |6 a | |0 tiny | |2 baby | , about |6 the | |2 width | of |6 a | |2 pencil | ."
|5 do | |2 babies | |1 this | |0 small | |4 hibernate | ?
|1 When | |3 you | |4 feed | |3 him | |1 how | |0 many | |2 pinkies | |5 do | |3 you | |4 feed | |3 him | ?
If |3 you | |4 feed | |3 him | |1 too | |0 many | |3 he | |5 could | |1 just | not |5 be | |0 hungry | .
If |3 he | |5 does | n't |4 seem | |0 interested | in |3 them | |1 at | |1 all | |3 I | |5 would | |4 say | |3 he | |5 's | |1 just | not |0 hungry | .
|3 My | |2 boyfriend | |4 has | one and |1 when | |3 she | |5 's | |0 hungry | |3 she | |4 attacks | |6 the | |2 pinkie | |1 right | |1 away | .
|3 They | |5 can | |4 smell | |3 it | |1 so | |3 i | |5 'm | |0 sure | |3 he | |4 knows | |3 what | |3 it | |5 is | and |1 just | |5 do | n't |4 want | |3 it | .
|4 Remember | |2 snakes | |5 can | |4 go | |6 a | |2 while | without |4 eating | .
"In |6 the | |2 winter | , |3 they | |5 will | |1 usually | |4 go | |1 deep | |1 underground | and |4 enter | |6 a | |2 hibernation | - |0 like | |2 state | |4 called | |2 brumation | , |3 which | |5 is | |4 characterized | by |6 a | |0 slowed | |2 metabolism | and |4 reduced | |2 activity | ."
"|2 King | |2 snakes | |1 sometimes | |4 stop | |4 eating | , |1 particularly | during |6 the | |0 cooler | |2 part | of |6 the | |2 year | ."
|3 They | |4 have | |6 a | |0 natural | |2 instinct | to |4 hibernate | .
"If |6 the | |2 snake | |5 is | not |0 pregnant | or |4 shedding | , and |3 its | |2 enclosure | |5 is | |1 properly | |4 equipped | , |6 a | |2 loss | of |2 appetite | |1 probably | |4 signals | |6 a | |2 beginning | of |2 hibernation | ."
"|2 Hibernation | |5 is | |0 natural | , and |6 a | |2 necessity | for |2 snakes | |3 that | |5 are | |4 going | to |5 be | |4 bred | ."
|6 Another | |2 thing | |3 that | |5 can | |4 cause | |6 a | |2 king | |2 snake | to |4 stop | |4 eating | |5 is | |2 shedding | .
"|3 You | |5 can | |4 tell | |1 when | |3 your | |2 king | |2 snake | |5 is | |0 about | to |4 shed | , because |3 its | |2 eyes | |5 will | |4 get | |0 milky | |4 looking | ."
"|3 Its | |2 body | |5 will | |5 be | |0 dull | |4 looking | , |1 too | ."
In |6 a | |0 few | |2 days | |6 the | |2 snake | |5 will | |4 begin | to |4 shed | |3 its | |2 skin | .
"For |2 example | , |6 some | |2 snakes | |5 will | |1 routinely | |4 go | off |3 their | |2 food | in both |6 the | |2 summer | and |2 winter | , |4 feeding | |1 mainly | in |2 spring | and |2 fall | ."
|3 It | |5 's | |0 natural | and |1 so | |1 long | as |3 you | |5 do | n't |4 see | |6 any | |0 serious | |2 deterioration | in |3 their | |2 health | |5 is | |3 nothing | to |4 worry | about .
"|3 You | |4 see | , |6 some | |2 snakes | for |6 no | |0 obvious | |2 reason | |5 will | |1 simply | |4 go | off |3 their | |2 food | ."
|3 They | |5 're | |0 fit | and |0 healthy | and |3 their | |2 care | |5 is | |0 suitable | .

|3 What | |5 was | |6 the | |2 goal | for |7 North | |7 Vietnam | in |6 the | |7 Tet | |7 offensive | ?
|1 When | |7 Johnson | |4 deployed | |2 troops | in 1964 |3 he | |5 was | |4 advised | by |6 the | |0 military | |3 it | |5 would | |4 take | |6 a | |2 half | - million |2 troops | |1 about | ten |2 years | to |4 pacify | |7 South | |7 Vietnam | .
|3 He | |4 refused | to |4 believe | |3 them | and |4 ordered | |6 the | |2 military | to |4 win | |6 the | |2 war | within two to three |2 years | ( before |6 the | |0 next | |2 election | in 1968 ) .
|3 He | |5 did | not |4 give | |3 them | |6 the | |2 number | of |2 troops | |3 they | |4 requested | .
"|3 This | |4 left | |7 Westmoreland | with |0 few | |2 options | , |1 so | |3 he | |4 adapted | |6 a | |4 Search | and |4 Destroy | |2 strategy | |1 instead | of |6 a | |4 Clear | and |4 Defend | |2 strategy | |3 which | |5 is | , in |6 the | |0 long | |2 run | , |6 the | |0 preferred | |2 method | of |4 pacifying | |6 an | |2 insurgency | ."
"|2 Thing | |4 is | , |3 it | |4 worked | ."
"|6 The | |7 ARVN | |5 was | not |4 having | |6 a | |0 big | |2 problem | with |6 the | |0 Local | |7 VC | ( |6 the | |2 guerilla | |2 movement | ) , |3 they | |5 were | |5 being | |4 challenged | by |6 the | |0 Main | |2 Force | |7 VC | ( |3 which | |5 was | |0 light | |2 infantry | ) and |6 the | |7 North | |7 Vietnamese | |7 Army | ( |7 NVA | ) ."
"|1 When | |6 the | |7 Americans | |4 swept | |1 in | with |3 their | |4 Search | and |4 Destroy | |2 operations | |6 the | |7 Communists | |1 quickly | |4 leaned | |3 they | |5 could | not |4 stand | up to |6 the | |7 US | |2 firepower | , and |6 these | |0 regular | |2 troops | |5 were | |4 forced | to |4 flee | |6 the | |2 country | and |4 take | |0 sanctuary | across |6 the | |2 borders | in |7 Laos | and |7 Cambodia | ."
"|6 All | |6 those | |0 sunny | |2 reports | about |6 the | |2 progress | in |7 Vietnam | |5 were | |0 correct | , |6 the | |7 Communists | |5 WERE | |5 being | |4 defeated | ."
"|1 However | , |7 Johnson | |5 would | not |4 let | |6 the | |2 military | |4 cross | |6 the | |2 borders | and |4 clean | out |6 the | |7 Communist | |2 bases | ."
"|3 He | |5 was | |4 warned | that |3 they | |5 were | |4 building | up |6 a | |0 huge | |2 Army | and |5 would | |1 eventually | |4 launch | |6 an | |2 attack | , but |3 he | |4 ignored | |3 his | |0 military | |2 advisers | ."
|6 The | |7 Communists | |4 agreed | .
|3 They | |5 could | not |4 defeat | |6 the | |7 Americans | .
"|1 However | , |3 what | |3 they | |4 hoped | to |4 do | during |6 the | |7 Tet | |7 Offensive | |4 was | to |4 sneak | past |6 the | |7 Americans | and |4 attack | |6 the | |7 ARVN | in |6 the | |0 urban | |2 areas | |1 where | |3 they | |5 were | |4 deployed | |4 doing | |0 successful | |4 Clear | and |4 Defend | |2 operations | ."
"|6 The | |7 Communists | |4 thought | |3 they | |5 could | |4 defeat | |6 the | |7 ARVN | , |4 cause | |6 the | |2 fall | of |6 the | |0 South | |0 Vietnamese | |2 government | , and |6 the | |2 people | |5 would | |1 than | |4 rally | to |6 the | |0 Communist | |2 cause | and |4 leave | |6 the | |7 Americans | |4 stranded | in |6 a | |2 sea | of |0 angry | |2 peasants | ."
|3 THAT | |5 WAS | |6 THE | |2 PLAN | .
|3 What | |4 happened | ?
|6 The | |7 Americans | |4 detected | |6 the | |2 attempt | to |4 infiltrate | |6 the | |0 urban | |2 areas | and |5 were | |1 already | |4 redeploying | |2 troops | from |6 the | |0 rural | |2 areas | .
|6 The | |7 ARVN | |4 rushed | |1 back | from |2 holiday | |2 leave | and |4 counterattacked | .
Within 24 |2 hours | |6 every | |7 Communist | |2 assault | |5 had | |5 been | |4 defeated | except in |6 the | |0 ancient | |2 capital | of |7 Hue | .
|6 The | |2 government | |5 did | NOT |4 fall | .
And |6 the | |0 South | |0 Vietnamese | |2 people | ?
"|1 When | |4 give | |6 the | |0 ultimate | |2 choice | , |3 they | |4 rallied | …"
TO |6 THE | |0 SOUTH | |0 VIETNAMESE | |2 GOVERNMENT | ….
|7 Tet | |5 was | |6 a | |0 huge | |0 military | and |0 political | |2 disaster | for |6 the | |7 Communists | .
|3 They | |5 were | |4 chased | |1 back | into |7 Laos | and |7 Cambodia | with |6 the | |7 ARVN | in |0 hot | |2 pursuit | .
"|6 The | |2 people | |4 rejected | |3 their | |2 attempt | to |4 topple | |6 the | |2 government | , and for |6 all | |2 intents | and |2 purposes | |6 the | |7 US | |2 military | ( and |6 the | |7 ARVN | ) |4 handed | |7 Johnson | |6 the | |2 victory | |3 he | |5 had | |4 ordered | |3 them | to |4 achieve | within |6 the | |2 time | - |2 frame | |3 he | |4 ordered | |3 it | ."
|6 All | |3 he | |4 had | to |4 do | for |6 a | |0 complete | |2 victory | |4 was | |4 allow | |6 the | |2 military | to |4 go | into |7 Laos | and |7 Cambodia | and |4 finish | off |6 the | |0 shattered | |7 Communist | |2 forces | .
But |7 Johnson | |5 was | |1 so | |0 obtuse | |3 he | |5 did | n’t |4 understand | |3 he | |4 had | |6 a | |2 victory | |1 when | |3 it | |5 was | |4 handed | to |3 him | on |6 a | |0 silver | |2 platter | .
"|1 Instead | |3 he | |4 pulled | |6 the | |0 military | off , |4 stopped | |6 the | |2 bombing | of |7 North | |7 Vietnam | , |4 withdrew | from |6 the | |0 presidential | |2 race | , and |4 spent | |6 the | |2 rest | of |3 his | |2 term | in |2 office | |4 trying | to |4 surrender | to |7 North | |7 Vietnam | ."
|3 They | |4 screwed | up by |1 not | |4 accepting | |3 his | |2 surrender | |1 when | |3 he | |4 offered | |3 it | .
"|6 The | |0 American | |2 people | |5 were | NOT |4 having | |6 any | of |3 it | , and |4 elected | |7 Richard | |7 Nixon | to |4 fix | |6 the | |2 mess | |7 LBJ | |5 had | |4 made | ( not to |4 surrender | like |6 the | |0 antiwar | |2 movement | |5 was | |4 demanding | ) ."
In |6 the | |2 end | |7 Nixon | |4 kept | |3 his | |2 promise | for “ … |2 peace | with |2 honor | …. ”
But |3 that | |5 ’s | |6 another | |2 question | .
"To |4 emancipate | |6 the | |2 south | , but |3 it | |5 was | |6 a | |0 serious | |2 failure | ."
To |4 make | |6 the | |2 war | |0 unpalatable | to |6 the | |0 American | |2 public | .
"In |3 that | , |3 they | |1 pretty | |1 much | |4 succeeded | ."
"Before |7 Tet | , |6 the | |2 war | |5 was | |0 unpopular | but |0 tolerable | to |6 the | |2 majority | of |7 Americans | in that |6 the | |2 loss | of |0 American | |2 lives | |5 was | |4 seen | as |6 the | |2 cost | of |4 subduing | |6 the | |7 VC | and |7 NVA | ."
|7 Tet | |4 made | |3 it | |0 clear | that |6 the | |2 war | |5 was | |6 a | |0 long | |2 way | from |5 being | |1 over | if |6 the | |7 Americans | |4 thought | |3 they | |5 could | |4 preserve | |6 the | |7 South | and that |6 the | |7 North | |5 was | |1 perfectly | |0 willing | to |4 suffer | |0 great | |2 losses | to |4 continue | |3 their | |2 fight | .
|3 There | |4 is | |6 a | |1 very | |0 good | |2 book | on |6 the | |2 subject | |3 that | |5 was | |4 written | by |7 General | |7 Vo | |7 Nguyen | |7 Giap | .

|3 I | |1 just | |4 bought | |6 a | |2 baby | one |2 yesterday | .
|3 I | |4 have | |6 a | |2 basking | |2 spot | |2 lamp | |3 that | |4 says | |3 it | |5 is | |6 a | |0 double | |2 reflector | |3 that | |4 focuses | 35 % |0 more | |0 light | / |2 heat | and |4 provides | |0 beneficial | |2 UVA | |2 rays | |0 important | to |6 the | |0 psycholical | |0 well | - |2 being | of |3 him | .
"|3 My | |2 question | |4 is | |5 does | |3 that | |4 mean | |3 it | |4 gives | |3 him | |1 not | |1 only | |6 the | |2 heat | , but |6 the | "" |2 sun | |2 rays | "" |3 he | |4 needs | ?"

"|6 The | |2 lady | at |7 pet | |7 smart | |4 said | 4 |2 hours | , but on |2 places | on |6 the | |2 net | |3 it | |4 says | 10 to 12 |2 hours | ."
"|3 He | |5 's | |4 getting | |0 used | to |3 his | |0 new | |2 home | , but |5 has | n't |4 eatin | |1 yet | ."
|3 I | |4 have | |0 bearded | |2 dragon | |2 juvenile | |2 food | and |4 freeze | - |4 dried | |2 crickets | .
|6 Any | |2 advice | |5 would | |5 be | |1 greatly | |4 appreciated | .
|4 Thank | |3 you | for |3 your | |2 time | .
"|4 Let | |3 me | |4 try | to |4 break | |3 this | down |1 as | |1 simply | as |3 I | |5 can | : |0 diurnal | ( |0 active | during |6 the | |2 day | |2 time | ) |2 reptiles | like |6 the | |0 bearded | |2 dragon | |4 require | 3 |2 types | of "" |2 light | , "" |2 UVA | , |2 UVB | , and |2 heat | ."
"|6 Any | |2 white | |2 light | |4 emitting | |2 light | |2 source | |5 will | |4 emit | |2 UVA | , |4 including | |2 heat | |2 bulbs | , |3 that | |5 's | |6 the | |0 easy | |2 one | to |4 provide | for ."
|2 UVB | on |6 the | |0 other | |2 hand | |5 can | |1 only | |5 be | |4 reproduced | by |6 a | |0 fluorescent | |2 source | .
"|2 UVB | |5 will | |1 always | |5 be | |6 a | |0 separate | |2 bulb | from |6 the | |2 heat | |2 lamp | , unless |3 you | |4 use | |6 a | |2 MVB | ( |2 mercury | |2 vapor | |2 bulb | ) |3 which | |5 is | |6 the | |0 only | |2 reptile | |2 use | |2 bulb | |3 that | |5 will | |4 emit | both |2 UVB | and |2 heat | from one |2 bulb | ."
|3 I | |1 highly | |4 recommend | that |3 you | |5 do | not |4 use | |0 coiled | / |0 compact | |2 UVB | |2 bulbs | as |3 they | |5 are | |4 known | to |4 cause | |0 severe | |2 eye | |2 damage | and / or |2 blindness | in |2 reptiles | |1 not | to |4 mention | |3 they | |4 have | |2 trouble | |4 maintaining | |2 UVB | |2 output | over |2 time | .
"|6 The | |0 long | |2 tube | |2 UVB | |2 bulbs | |5 are | |0 best | , like |7 Zoomed | 's |7 Repsitun | |2 model | : http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ |4 Remember | to |4 replace | |2 UVB | |2 bulbs | |4 according | to |6 the | |2 manufacturer | s |2 recommendation | after |6 which | |2 time | |6 the | |2 bulb | |5 will | |1 no | |1 longer | |4 produce | |2 UVB | |1 even | if |0 visible | |2 light | |1 still | |4 is | ."

http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/caresheet/?page=1
mm |3 it | |4 depends | on |6 the | |2 size | of |3 his | |2 tank | or |2 cage | or |6 whatever | |3 you | |4 have | |3 him | in .. |1 atleast | |1 as | |1 far | as |3 i | |5 'm | |0 concerned | .
"if |3 there | |4 are | |0 shady | |2 areas | |3 he | |5 can | |4 move | to ( for |2 example | |6 a | 3 x 5 x 4 |2 tank | with |2 light | on one |2 side | ) |1 then | |3 you | |5 can | |4 leave | |3 it | |0 on | |6 a | |0 full | 12 - 14 |2 hours | , if |3 it | |5 s | |6 a | |0 small | |2 tank | and |3 he | |5 ca | n't |4 escape | |6 the | |2 light | |1 then | 4 - 6 |1 at | |1 most | at |6 a | |2 time | |1 though | |1 quite | |1 possibly | 4 - 6 |2 hours | at |6 a | |2 time | |1 twice | |6 a | |2 day | ."
|6 either | |2 way | |3 you | |1 also | |4 need | to |4 keep | |6 an | |2 eye | on |6 the | |2 temperature | if |3 you | |5 are | |4 using | |6 a | |2 dry | |2 fish | |2 tank | as |7 UV | |2 lights | in |3 my | |2 experience | |4 up | |6 the | |2 temperature | |1 significantly | and without |0 proper | |2 ventilation | |3 it | |5 can | |4 become | |6 an | |0 oven | .

"Yes , |3 it | |4 gives | |3 him | |6 the | "" |2 sun | |2 rays | "" |0 necessary | , |3 that | |4 's | |3 what | |7 UVA | |5 is | ."

"|1 Also | , |7 Beardies | |1 often | |5 do | not |4 eat | |2 food | |3 that | |5 is | not |4 moving | , |1 so | |3 it | |4 s | |3 anyone | 's |2 guess | whether or |1 not | |3 he | |5 'll | |4 touch | |6 the | |4 freeze | - |4 dried | |2 crickets | or |6 the | |4 processed | |2 food | ."

"Hi |1 there | ,"
Please |4 choose | |6 the | |2 parakeet | ...
|1 Here | |5 s | |3 my | |2 reason | .....
|3 I | |4 did | |6 the | |0 same | |2 thing | |3 that | |3 you | |4 did | for |7 christmas | .
|3 I | |4 ended | up |4 getting | |6 a | |2 pair | of |2 zebra | |2 finches | for |7 christmas | .
At |1 first | |3 it | |5 was | |1 all | |0 cool | and |6 all | .
|3 They | |5 were | |4 chirping | and |4 doing | |3 their | every |0 day | |2 business | .
After |6 a | |2 couple | of |2 weeks | |3 I | |4 got | |0 tired | of |3 them | .
|3 They | |5 are | |1 quite | |0 messy | and |3 you | |5 can | not |4 hold | or |4 pet | |3 them | .
|3 I | |5 ve | |4 tried | to |4 tame | |3 them | and |3 they | |1 just | |5 would | not |5 get | |4 tamed | .
|3 They | |5 do | nt |4 want | to |5 be | |4 held | or |4 touched | .
|3 I | |4 want | |6 a | |2 bird | |3 that | |3 I | |5 can | |4 hold | and |4 do | |2 tricks | .
|3 I | |1 still | |4 have | |3 them | and |3 they | |5 are | |4 doing | |1 well | .
|6 A | |2 couple | of |2 months | after |3 I | |4 got | |2 parakeets | / |2 budgies | .
|3 They | |5 are | |0 adorable | |3 they | |4 have | |0 beautiful | |2 colors | and |2 personality | .
|3 I | |4 love | |3 them | .
|1 First | of |6 all | |3 they | |5 are | |1 very | |0 tame | .
|3 I | |4 tamed | |3 them | in 4 |2 days | .
|3 They | |5 can | |4 do | |2 tricks | and |3 they | |5 are | nt |0 messy | .
|6 The | |0 whole | |2 family | |4 loves | |3 them | .
|3 My | |2 parents | |1 even | |4 plays | with |3 them | .
|3 They | |5 are | |6 a | |0 big | |2 part | of |3 our | |2 family | .
|3 I | |4 hope | |3 this | |4 helps | |3 you | with |3 your | |2 decision | .
|3 They | |5 are | |1 both | |1 about | |6 the | |0 same | |2 noise | |2 level | .
|1 When | |4 choosing | |6 a | |2 parakeet | |4 look | for |6 a | |0 young | |2 one | .
"( |6 the | |0 younger | |6 the | |0 eaiser | to |4 tame | ) |4 Look | for |0 clean | |0 smooth | |2 feathers | , |2 beak | , and |0 clean | |2 vent | |2 feathers | ( |6 the | |2 feathers | around |6 the | |2 butt | .. |0 dirty | |2 vent | |2 feathers | |4 means | |6 the | |2 bird | |5 is | not |0 healthy | ) |4 Look | for |6 a | |0 dark | |2 eye | with |6 no | |2 circles | ( |6 the | |0 older | |2 ones | |4 have | |6 a | |2 circle | |2 ring | in |3 their | |2 eyes | ) ."
|4 Look | for |6 a | |2 lot | of |2 stripes | in |3 their | |2 head | |3 that | |4 starts | from |6 the | |2 beak | and |4 goes | |1 back | to |6 the | |2 back | fo |6 the | |2 bird | .
|6 the | |2 stripes | |5 are | like |2 hair | |6 the | |0 less | |2 stipes | |6 the | |0 older | .
( |4 think | of |6 a | |4 balding | |2 man | lol ) |4 Look | for |0 clean | |2 feathers | .
If |3 you | |4 want | |6 a | |2 boy | |6 the | |2 cere | ( |6 the | |2 nostrils | |2 piece | above |6 the | |2 beak | ) |5 must | |5 be | |0 blue | .
|6 The | |2 girl | |4 has | either |0 pink | or |0 brown | .
|3 I | |5 would | |4 recommend | that |3 you | |4 get | two |2 parakeets | .
"But |4 get | either one |2 male | and one |2 female | , or two |2 males | ."
|5 Do | not |4 get | two |2 females | .
"|3 They | |1 sometimes | |5 do | nt |4 get | |1 along | ( |3 you | |4 know | |1 how | |6 some | |2 girls | |5 are | lol hahahaahh but for |0 real | |1 though | , two |2 girls | |4 tend | to |4 fight | |6 a | |2 lot | ."
|3 I | |4 have | one |0 yellow | |2 girl | and |6 a | |0 green | and |0 yellow | |2 boy | .
|3 They | |5 are | |6 the | |0 best | !
If |3 you | |4 choose | to |4 get | |6 a | |2 parakeet | |3 this | |5 is | |6 a | |2 trick | |3 that | |3 I | |4 used | to |4 tame | |3 them | .
"|1 However | if |3 you | |4 plan | on |4 getting | one , |1 then | |4 get | |0 more | than one at |6 the | |0 same | |2 time | |3 they | |4 need | |2 company | ."
|3 My | |2 mom | |4 told | |3 me | |1 how | to |4 tame | |3 them | and |3 I | |5 was | |1 very | |0 happy | with |6 the | |2 results | .
|3 It | |4 took | |3 me | 4 |2 days | to |4 get | |6 the | |0 new | |2 one | to |5 be | |0 able | to |4 step | on and |4 eat | out of |3 my | |2 hand | .
|3 These | |5 are | |6 the | |2 steps | |3 I | |4 used | .
|1 Honestly | |3 they | |5 have | |4 worked | for |3 me | |1 twice | with |3 my | |2 parakeets | .
|1 Hopefully | |3 they | |5 will | |4 work | for |3 you | .
"1 ) |1 When | |3 you | |4 get | |6 the | |2 bird | , |4 place | |3 him | or |3 her | or |3 them | in |6 the | |2 cage | ."
|4 Leave | |3 them | in |1 there | with |2 food | and |2 water | and |0 such | for |1 about | 2 |2 hours | .
2 ) |1 Then | |4 place | |3 you | |2 hand | in |6 the | |2 cage | .
|3 I | |4 took | |6 the | |2 cage | and |4 place | |3 it | |1 next | to |6 the | |2 couch | .
"|1 Then | |3 I | |4 sat | on |6 the | |2 couch | , |4 placed | one |2 hand | in |6 the | |2 cage | , |4 holding | |6 a | |2 millet | |2 spray | ."
"( |6 this | |2 way | |3 the | |5 will | |4 associate | |3 your | |2 hand | with |2 food | , and |2 birds | |4 love | |2 food | lol ) |1 Then | |3 I | |4 turned | on |6 the | |2 tv | and |4 watch | ."
|6 This | |2 way | |3 they | |5 will | |4 see | that |3 your | |2 hand | |5 is | |0 good | and |3 it | |5 s | not |4 going | to |4 grab | |3 them | or |4 hurt | |3 them | .
|4 Do | |3 this | for |1 about | one |2 hour | .
( |3 you | |5 can | |4 take | |2 breaks | if |3 you | |4 have | too ) and |4 repeat | |6 the | |2 steps | after |1 about | 2 |2 hours | .
"3 ) After |1 about | |2 day | 2 , |3 they | |5 will | |4 start | to |4 eating | |6 the | |2 millet | |2 spray | from |3 your | |2 hand | ."
"( |5 do | not |4 take | away |6 the | |2 food | |2 dish | from |6 the | |2 birds | , |3 they | |5 will | |4 associate | |3 you | as |6 the | |2 person | |3 who | |4 takes | away |3 their | |2 food | ) ...."
"|1 Then | |4 take | |3 your | |2 finger | and |4 place | |3 it | under |3 their | |2 belly | , in |2 front | of |3 their | |2 feet | and |4 say | |1 up | ."
|4 Push | |3 you | |2 finger | to |3 their | |2 feet | |1 gently | and |4 say | |1 up | .
( |6 the | |0 first | |2 couple | of |2 times | |3 they | |5 will | |4 fly | |1 all | over |6 the | |2 cage | but |1 as | |1 long | as |3 you | |5 do | nt |4 jump | |1 back | or |4 screem | |3 they | |5 will | |4 get | |0 used | to |3 you | ) |3 They | |5 will | |4 have | |6 no | |2 choice | but to |4 go | on |3 your | |2 finger | .
"|1 When | |3 they | |4 see | that |3 you | |5 ar | nt |4 harming | |3 them | , |3 the | |5 will | |4 go | up on |3 your | |2 finger | |1 when | |3 you | |4 say | |1 up | ."
4 ) If |3 they | |5 are | not |4 going | |1 up | by |1 now | |3 you | |1 just | |4 got | ta |4 keep | |4 trying | and |4 keep | |4 trying | .
"|5 Do | not |4 hit | , |4 yell | , or |4 harm | |3 them | ."
|3 You | |4 have | |2 patience | .
|5 Do | nt |4 give | up !
"After |6 a | |2 couple | of |2 weeks | |3 mines | |4 knows | |1 when | |3 I | |4 say | |2 shoulder | |3 it | |4 means | ot |4 go | on |3 my | |2 sholder | , |1 when | |3 I | |4 say | |1 up | |3 it | |4 means | to |4 jump | |1 up | on |3 my | |2 finger | , |1 when | |3 I | |4 say | |1 up | and |1 out | |3 it | |4 means | up on |3 my | |2 finger | and out of |6 the | |2 cage | ."
and |1 when | |3 I | |4 say | |4 go | |1 home | |3 it | |4 means | to |4 go | in |6 the | |2 cage | .
|0 Good | |2 luck | !
|3 They | |4 worked | for |3 me | and |3 I | |4 hope | |3 they | |4 worked | for |3 you | !
|3 They | |5 are | |0 awesome | !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And |3 that | |5 s | |3 my | |2 reason | |1 why | |3 you | |5 should | |4 choose | |6 a | |2 parakeet | over |6 a | |2 finch | .
|6 a | |2 parakeet | |5 is | |0 friendlier |
|2 Parakeet | .
|3 They | |5 are | |1 normally | |0 quiet | and |3 it | |5 is | |0 easy | to |4 take | |2 care | of |3 them | .
|3 They | |5 are | |1 also | |0 friendly | .
|3 I | |4 have | |6 a | |2 parakeet | |4 named | |7 Cookie | . :P
|1 When | |5 is | |6 the | |0 best | |2 time | to |4 travel | to |7 Ireland | ?
|3 My | |2 sister | and |3 I | |5 would | |4 like | to |4 go | to |7 Ireland | .
"|3 I | |4 graduate | in |6 the | |2 spring | , and |1 so | |3 we | |5 'd | |4 like | to |4 go | between |1 then | and |2 winter | ."
"|3 We | |5 do | n't |4 want | |1 too | |0 many | |2 tourists | , and since |3 we | |5 'll | |1 both | |5 be | out of |2 school | |3 we | |5 can | |4 go | |1 anytime | between |6 the | |2 middle | of |7 June | to |0 early | |7 November | ."
"|3 We | |5 do | n't |4 want | |3 it | to |5 be | |1 too | |0 cold | ( not |0 sure | |1 when | |1 exactly | |3 there | |2 fall | |5 is | ... or |3 what | |6 the | |2 weather | |5 is | |1 really | like |1 there | during |3 our | |2 autumn | |2 months | ) , but |3 we | |5 do | n't |4 feel | like |3 we | |4 need | to |4 go | |1 right | in |6 the | |2 middle | of |2 summer | |1 either | ."
|3 We | |5 're | |1 both | in |3 our | |0 early | |2 20s | and |1 just | |4 wanting | to |4 explore | |6 the | |0 beautiful | |2 country | while |3 we | |5 're | |1 still | |0 young | and before |3 our | |2 lives | |4 start | to |4 get | |1 even | |0 crazier | !
|5 Can | |3 anyone | |4 give | |3 me | |6 an | |2 idea | of |1 when | |6 the | |0 best | |2 time | for |3 us | to |4 go | to |7 Ireland | |5 would | |5 be | ?
"|2 People | |5 do | not |4 go | to |7 Ireland | on |2 holiday | for |6 the | |2 weather | , |3 it | |5 is | |0 unpredictable | ."
One |2 thing | |3 you | |5 can | |5 be | |0 sure | of about |0 Irish | |2 weather | |4 is | |1 how | |0 little | |3 you | |5 can | |5 be | |0 sure | of .
"|3 It | |5 may | |5 be | |2 shirtsleeves | and |2 sunglasses | in |7 February | , but |2 winter | |2 woollies | in |7 March | and |1 even | during |6 the | |2 summer | ."
And |1 then | |1 there | |4 ’s | |6 the | |2 rain | .
"|7 Ireland | |4 receives | |6 a | |2 lot | of |2 rain | , with |0 certain | |2 areas | |4 getting | |6 a | |2 soaking | |1 as | |0 many | as 270 |2 days | of |6 the | |2 year | ."
|7 County | |7 Kerry | |4 is | |6 the | |1 worst | |4 affected | .
"|6 The | |2 southeast | |5 is | |6 the | |0 driest | , |4 enjoying | |6 a | |1 more | |0 continental | |2 climate | ."
"|6 The | |0 Irish | |2 weather | |4 works | on |6 the | ‘ four |2 seasons | in |6 a | |2 day | ’ |2 principle | , |3 which | |1 basic­ally | |4 means | that |3 you | |5 ca | n’t |4 predict | |6 a | |2 thing | |1 when | |3 it | |4 comes | to |6 the | |2 behaviour | of |6 the | |2 sky | ."
"|6 Some | |0 basic | |2 assumptions | , |1 however | , |5 can | |5 be | |4 made | ."
"In |2 summer | , from |7 May | to |7 July | , |6 the | |2 days | |5 are | |1 reasonably | |0 warm | and – |1 most | |1 importantly | – |1 very | |0 long | : at |6 the | |2 height | of |2 summer | |3 you | |5 wo | n’t |4 need | to |4 turn | on |2 lights | until after 10 |2 pm | ."
"|3 It | |5 is | |1 also | |0 peak | |2 tourist | |2 season | , |3 which | |4 means | |3 there | |4 are | |1 far | |0 more | |2 people | |1 just | |1 about | |1 everywhere | but |6 the | |1 most | |0 remote | |2 corners | of |6 the | |2 island | , and |2 prices | |5 are | at |3 their | |0 highest | ."
"Not |1 surprisingly | , |0 most | of |6 the | |0 yearly | |2 festivals | |4 occur | during |6 these | |2 times | so as to |4 take | |2 advantage | of |6 the | |2 crowds | and |6 the | |1 more | |0 favourable | |2 weather | ."
"|2 Spring | ( |7 February | to |7 April | ) and |7 Autumn | ( |7 August | to |7 October | ) |4 make | |0 good | |2 alternatives | , although |6 the | |2 country | ’s |1 ever | - |4 growing | |2 popularity | as |6 a | |2 tourist | |2 destination | |5 can | |1 often | |4 blur | |6 the | |2 lines | between mid - and |0 high | - |2 season | |2 tourism | ."
"|1 Still | , |3 you | |4 have | |6 a | |0 better | |2 chance | of |6 some | |2 peace | and |2 quiet | , and |6 the | |2 weather | |5 can | |5 be | |1 surprisingly | |0 better | in |7 April | and |7 September | than in |7 mid-July | – |1 again | , |3 it | |5 ’s | |1 all | |2 part | of |6 the | |2 uncertainty | |2 principle | ."
|7 Spring | |2 festivities | |4 include | |6 the | |1 ever | - |0 popular | |7 St | |7 Patrick | ’s |7 Festival | .
"Although |2 temperatures | |5 do | not |1 often | |4 venture | below |2 freezing | , |2 winter | ( |7 December | to |7 February | ) |5 can | |5 be | |0 brutal | , for |0 huge | |2 parts | of |6 the | |2 country | – |6 the | |2 west | and |2 northwest | in |0 particular | ."
"|2 Crowds | |5 are | at |3 their | |0 thinnest | , but |0 many | of |6 the | |2 country | ’s |2 tourist | |2 attractions | and |2 services | |4 close | down in |7 October | and |5 do | n’t |4 reopen | until |7 Easter | , |3 which | |1 paradoxically | |4 leaves | |2 visitors | with |6 a | |1 more | |0 convincing | |2 taste | of |1 how | |7 Ireland | |5 is | |4 experienced | by |0 most | of |6 the | |0 Irish | : |3 it | |5 ’s | |0 cold | , |0 grey | and |0 dark | by 5 |2 pm | , but |3 there | |4 ’s | |1 always | |6 a | |2 pub | to |4 escape | into |1 when | |6 the | |2 rain | |4 starts | |4 sheeting | |1 down | ."
"|6 The | |2 thing | to |4 do | |4 is | to |4 bring | |6 the | |0 right | |2 clothing | with |3 you | , |2 clothes | so |3 you | |5 can | |4 layer | up if |3 it | |5 is | |0 cold | and |4 take | off |2 layers | |1 when | |3 it | |4 warms | up ."
|0 Waterproof | |2 clothing | and |2 footwear | |5 are | |0 essential | plus |6 an | |2 umbrella | ..
"As |6 that | |0 famous | |7 Scotsman | |7 Billy | |7 Connolly | |4 says | "" |3 there | |4 is | |6 no | |0 such | |2 thing | as |0 bad | |2 weather | |1 just | |6 the | |0 wrong | |2 clothes | """
"|0 Afraid | |3 I | |5 can | not |5 be | |1 more | |0 helpful | , |3 it | |5 is | |1 really | |6 a | |2 case | of |2 pot | |2 luck | , although as |6 the | |2 weather | |5 is | |1 so | |0 changeable | |1 often | |6 a | |0 cold | |0 wet | |2 morning | |5 will | |4 turn | into |6 a | |0 lovely | |0 warm | |0 sunny | |2 afternoon | and |2 evening | or |1 visa | |1 versa | ."
If |3 you | |4 mean | |6 the | |7 Republic | of |7 Ireland | ( |7 Dublin | ) |1 then | |1 anytime | .
|6 The | |2 summer | |1 there | |5 is | |1 much | |1 more | |0 mild | than |0 most | of |6 the | |7 US | ( |5 are | |3 you | |4 coming | from |6 the | |7 US | ? ) .
|3 Their | |2 seasons | |5 are | |6 the | |0 same | as |6 all | |6 the | |2 countries | in |6 the | |0 Northern | |2 Hemisphere | but |3 I | |5 would | |4 suggest | |2 fall | .
|3 It | |5 does | |4 get | |1 pretty | |0 cold | in |7 Ireland | |1 so | |4 going | before |2 winter | |5 is | |3 your | |0 best | |2 bet | .
|7 September | for |2 example | .
|4 Rent | |6 a | |2 car | and |4 spend | |6 a | |2 couple | |2 days | |1 outside | of |7 Dublin | |4 seeing | |6 the | |2 countryside | and |3 you | |5 will | |4 have | |6 the | |2 trip | of |6 a | |2 lifetime | .
"To |4 explore | |6 the | |0 beautiful | |2 countryside | |3 you | |5 will | |4 need | to |5 be | |0 old | |1 enough | to |4 hire | |6 a | |2 car | because |0 public | |2 transport | |5 is | |0 expensive | & |1 only | |4 goes | |1 as | |1 far | as |6 the | |0 main | |2 towns | / |2 cities | , |0 most | |0 rural | |2 places | |5 do | n't |4 have | |6 a | |2 bus | or |2 train | |2 service | ."

By |2 definition | |0 most | |2 tourists | |5 will | |4 go | to |6 the | |0 best | |2 places | |1 so | |3 you | |5 might | |4 have | to |4 put | up with |6 a | |0 few | |2 tourists | along |6 the | |2 way | .
|0 Best | |2 weather | |6 the | |0 past | |2 couple | of |2 years | |5 has | |5 been | around |0 late | |7 April | - |0 late | |7 May | but |3 it | |5 can | |4 pour | with |2 rain | for |2 days | on |2 end | at |6 any | |2 time | of |6 the | |2 year | |1 so | |5 be | |0 prepared | with |0 waterproof | |2 jackets | / |2 boots | etc .
"|3 We | |1 only | |4 had | |6 a | |0 few | |0 sunny | |2 days | |6 this | |2 summer | , |1 barely | 24 |7 C | on |6 a | |0 few | |2 occasions | , |1 more | like 14 |7 C | |0 most | |2 days | ."
|3 We | |4 used | |3 our | |2 BBQ | on |1 precisely | 4 |2 occasions | .

"|3 We | |4 had | |2 frosts | in |7 October | |1 so | |3 I | |5 would | n't |4 advise | |4 visiting | |1 late | in |6 the | |2 year | to |5 be | |0 honest | , |2 Spring | |2 time | |5 is | |3 your | |0 best | |2 bet | ."
|3 You | |5 do | |4 realise | |3 it | |5 is | |1 quite | |0 expensive | to |4 visit | |7 Ireland | ?

|4 Eating | |1 out | in |0 particular | |5 is | |1 quite | |0 expensive | |4 compared | to |7 America | |3 I | |4 believe | .

Wow !
"If |3 they | |5 are | |0 able | to |4 take | |2 earthworms | |0 uncut | , |3 that | |5 is | |1 really | |0 impressive | !"
"|3 I | |4 aspire | to |3 your | |2 feeding | |2 regime | , |2 flakes | |1 early | and |3 something | |0 live | |1 later | in |6 the | |2 day | ."
"|2 Worms | ( and |2 Daphnia | ) |5 are | |1 also | |0 rich | in |2 Lipids | , |2 substances | |0 important | in |4 forming | |2 eggs | and |4 growing | |2 young | ."
|3 I | |4 think | that |3 you | |4 understand | that |3 your | |0 largest | and |0 smallest | |0 golden | |2 wonders | |5 are | |2 males | .
If |3 you | |5 would | |4 like | |0 more | on |4 sexing | out |7 Aplocheilus | |7 lineatus | |4 take | |6 a | |2 look | at |6 the | |2 discussion | in |6 the | |0 first | |2 source | |1 below | .
If |3 you | |4 have | |2 plants | in |3 your | |2 tank | .
|3 your | |2 lineatus | |5 are | |1 already | |4 spawning | .
"If |2 conditions | |5 are | |0 favorable | ( 78 - 82 |2 F | ) and |6 the | |2 fish | |4 are | |1 obviously | |1 well | |4 fed | as |3 yours | |4 are | , |3 they | |5 will | |4 spawn | ."
( |3 I | |5 've | |1 even | |4 had | |6 a | |2 pair | of |2 killies | |4 leave | |2 eggs | on |6 a | |4 floating | |2 thermometer | !
If |3 you | |4 wish | to |4 pick | |2 eggs | |4 make | |6 a | |0 acrylic | |2 spawning | |2 mop | .
|4 Check | out |6 the | |0 second | |2 source | .
"|3 I | |4 prefer | |0 darker | |2 colors | because |3 I | |5 can | |4 see | |3 their | |2 eggs | , |1 more | |1 easily | and |6 the | |2 fish | |4 look | |0 better | |1 next | to |3 them | ."
"|4 Use | |6 a | |1 well | |4 rinsed | |2 medicine | |2 vial | , |6 a | |2 cork | , |0 new | |2 fishing | |2 bobber | or |1 even | |6 a | |2 piece | of |0 non-crumbly | |2 styrofoam | to |4 float | |3 them | ."
"|3 There | |4 are | |6 a | |2 couple | |2 ways | |3 one | |5 could | |4 spawn | |2 lineatus | - |2 mop | |4 spawning | & |2 water | |4 incubating | |3 them | for two |2 weeks | , |4 picking | |2 eggs | from |6 a | |2 mop | & |4 putting | |3 them | in |6 a | |2 tray | of |0 treated | , |0 seasoned | |2 water | or |4 setting | up |6 the | |2 parents | in |6 a | |4 planted | |2 tank | & |4 moving | |3 them | so |6 the | |2 fry | |5 can | |4 hatch | |1 out | |1 there | ."
"If |3 you | |4 have | |6 the | |2 room | to |4 separate | |6 the | |2 male | ( s ) & |2 females | ( s ) , & |4 feed | |3 them | |1 well | on |0 live | |2 foods | , ( |4 assuming | that |3 you | |5 are | |4 doing | |0 weekly | 50 % |2 water | |2 changes | ) |1 when | |3 you | |4 put | |3 them | |1 together | |3 they | |5 will | |4 leave | |6 a | |2 lot | |0 more | |2 eggs | ."
"|1 Just | |4 making | up |2 examples | , but if |6 a | |2 pair | |5 is | |1 constantly | |1 together | , |3 they | |5 may | |4 lay | 10 - 15 |2 eggs | |6 a | |2 day | ."
"With |0 extra | |2 blackworms | and |1 maybe | |4 frozen | ( |4 defrosted | , |4 rinsed | ) |4 frozen | |2 foods | |1 earlier | in |6 the | |2 day | , |3 they | |5 may | |4 leave | 30 - 40 |2 eggs | at |6 a | |2 time | ."
"|4 Separated | and |4 feed | |1 extremely | |0 nourishing | |2 stuff | , |3 they | |5 may | |4 produce | |0 more | ."
|4 Separating | |6 a | |2 pair | |6 some | |2 time | before |6 a | |2 show | ( |2 killies | |5 are | |1 usually | |4 shown | & |4 judged | & |1 often | |4 sold | as |2 pairs | ) |5 will | |4 encourage | |3 them | to |4 court | and |4 show | |3 their | |0 best | |2 colors | .
|3 They | |1 also | |4 start | |6 the | |2 day | with |6 no | |2 nicks | or |2 dings | in |3 their | |2 fins | .
|6 The | |2 water | |2 changes | |4 help | with |3 that | |1 too | .
|3 You | |1 also | |5 may | |4 need | to |4 treat | |6 the | |2 incubation | |2 water | .
|6 The | |2 chlorine | and |2 ammonia | ( |2 choramine | ) |5 are | not |0 good | for |6 the | |2 eggs | .
|1 Ironically | |1 sometimes | |3 it | |5 is | |0 wise | to |4 leave | |6 the | |1 newly | |4 picked | |2 eggs | in |0 fresh | |2 tap | |2 water | with |6 some | |2 chlorination | to |4 kill | |0 microscopic | |2 critters | |3 that | |4 ride | |1 in | with |6 the | |2 eggs | .
"|1 THEN | |4 put | |6 the | |2 eggs | in |2 water | |4 treated | |6 a | |2 couple | of |2 days | |1 before | with |6 a | |2 water | |2 treatment | and |4 left | |0 open | to "" |4 breathe | "" ."
|4 Leaving | |6 a | |2 jar | with |6 a | |2 dozen | |0 black | |2 worms | in |3 it | |5 will | |4 sate | |6 the | |2 adult | 's |2 desire | for |2 snacks | and |3 they | |5 are | |1 more | |0 likely | to |4 leave | |2 fry | or |2 eggs | |0 alone | .
If |6 a | |2 pair | |5 is | n't |4 leaving | |2 eggs | ... |4 check | |6 the | |4 following | :
1 . |5 Is | |6 a | |2 tank | |2 mate | ( |0 such | as |6 another | |0 female | |2 killie | or |6 a | |2 Cory | or |0 large | |2 snails | ) |4 rating | |6 the | |2 eggs | ?
2 . |5 Have | |3 we | |4 kept | up with |0 partial | |2 water | |2 changes | ?
3 . |4 Is | |3 there | |1 too | |0 much | |2 mineral | in |6 the | |2 water | ?
|2 Aplo. | |2 lineatus | |4 are | |0 wide | - |4 spread | over |0 southern | |7 India | .
|3 That | |4 indicates | that |3 they | |4 thrive | in |0 different | |2 water | |2 chemistries | .
"|1 Still | if |3 you | |5 can | |4 get | |3 your | |2 pet | |2 shop | to |4 do | |6 a | |2 hardness | or |2 TDS | ( |0 total | |4 Dissolved | |2 Solids | ) |2 test | , |3 that | |5 may | |4 give | |3 you | |6 a | |2 hint | ."
"|4 Winging | |3 it | |6 a | |0 little | |1 here | , |6 a | |2 hardness | of 100 to |1 nearly | 200 |2 PPM | ( |2 parts | per |2 million | ) or 5.8 to 10.6 |2 DH | |5 should | |5 be | |0 fine | for |2 gardneri | ."
|2 TDS | |2 meters | ( |6 the | |0 thrifty | |2 aquarist | 's |2 hardness | |2 meter | |5 can | |5 be | |4 used | if |3 one | |5 has | |4 seen | one of |3 your | |0 municipal | |2 water | |2 department | 's |0 annual | |2 reports | .
"|3 They | |4 include | |6 a | |2 number | of |2 minerals | |1 there | and |3 you | |5 can | |4 figure | out |6 what | |2 percentage | of |3 that | |5 would | |5 be | |3 your | |2 hardness | |2 minerals | ( |2 calcium | , |2 magnesium | and |2 iron | ) ."
|6 A | |2 number | of |2 minerals | |5 are | not of |0 much | |2 consequence | .
|1 However | if |3 there | |4 is | |6 a | |0 high | |2 level | of |2 sodium | |2 chloride | ( |0 common | |2 salt | ) |3 that | |5 can | |4 break | down |6 the | |2 chorion | ( |2 shell | ) around |6 the | |2 egg | and |4 allow | |2 critters | to |4 get | |1 in | and |4 eat | |6 the | |2 yoke | and |2 embryo | . )
|1 Ironically | |1 sometimes | |3 it | |5 is | |0 wise | to |1 newly | |4 picked | |2 eggs | in |0 fresh | |2 tap | |2 water | with |6 some | |2 chlorination | to |4 kill | |0 microscopic | |2 critters | |3 that | |4 ride | |1 in | with |6 the | |2 eggs | .
"|1 THEN | |4 put | |6 the | |2 eggs | in |2 water | |4 treated | |6 a | |2 couple | of |2 days | |1 before | with |6 a | |2 water | |2 treatment | and |4 left | |0 open | to "" |4 breathe | "" ."
"If |3 you | |4 get | |2 eggs | in |6 the | |2 mail | in |6 a | |2 medicine | |2 vial | , |3 that | |5 is | |0 fine | ."
"But |4 get | |6 the | |2 eggs | out , |1 maybe | |4 rinsed | in |0 fresh | |2 tap | |2 water | and |1 then | into |6 the | |2 incubation | |2 water | ."
In |2 time | |6 the | |2 eggs | |5 can | |4 suffocate | in |6 the | |2 shipping | |2 container | .
"After |6 a | |2 number | of |2 people | |4 began | |4 complaining | about "" |2 mystery | |2 deaths | "" among |4 incubating | |2 eggs | , |6 some | of |6 the | |1 more | |0 advanced | |2 killie | |2 people | |4 began | |4 suggesting | that after 7 - 8 |2 days | of |2 incubation | , |3 one | |5 should | |4 do | |6 a | 100 % |2 water | |2 change | - as |6 the | |2 eggs | |4 develop | , |3 they | |5 do | |4 release | |2 waste | |2 material | ."
|6 Another | |2 problem | |4 is | that |1 sometimes | |0 bad | |2 eggs | |5 will | |4 fungus | and |6 the | |2 fungus | |5 will | |4 spread | |1 out | and |4 kill | |6 all | |6 the | |2 eggs | .
"|6 Some | |2 people | |4 put | in |6 a | |1 very | |0 dilute | |7 Acriflaven | |2 solution | to |4 slow | down |6 the | |2 fungus | , so |3 one | |5 can | |4 take | |0 white | |2 eggs | out with |6 a | |2 pipette | or |2 eyedropper | ."
|2 Other | |5 will | |4 add | |6 a | |2 drop | of |7 Methylene | |0 blue | .
"If |6 an | |2 egg | |4 turns | |0 blue | , |3 it | |5 had | |4 died | and |1 then | |4 became | |0 dyed | as |6 the | |0 outer | |2 membrane | |4 broke | down ."
|4 Get | |3 those | |1 out | |1 ASAP | |1 too | .
|4 Hope | |3 there | |4 is | |0 useful | |2 grist | for |6 the | |2 mill | |1 here | .

|3 You | |5 will | |1 never | |5 be | |1 so | |0 spoiled | in |3 your | |2 life | as |3 you | |5 are | on |6 a | |7 Disney | |2 Cruise | .
"If |3 you | |4 stay | with |3 your | |2 dining | |2 schedule | , |6 every | |2 night | |5 is | |2 dinner | and |6 a | |2 show | ."
|6 The | |0 real | |2 payoff | |5 is | that |3 you | |5 will | |4 have | |6 the | |0 same | |2 waiter | for |6 the | |0 entire | |2 cruise | .
|3 Our | |2 waiter | |1 quickly | |4 grasped | |6 the | |2 fact | that |3 I | |4 like | |2 Ginger | |2 ale | and |1 rather | |0 spicy | |2 foods | while |3 my | |2 wife | 's |2 taste | |4 ran | to |2 lemonade | and |1 less | |0 spicy | |2 fare | .
"Since |3 they | |4 knew | |3 our | |2 preferences | , |3 we | |1 almost | |1 always | |4 went | |1 along | with |3 their | |2 menu | |2 suggestions | and |5 were | |1 never | |0 sorry | |3 we | |4 did | ."
|1 Obviously | |3 they | |4 had | |6 a | |0 full | |2 beverage | |2 list | |4 including | |2 alcohol | for |2 adults | |3 who | |4 wanted | |3 it | .
"If |3 you | |5 should | |4 miss | |6 a | |2 meal | , |3 you | |1 also | |4 missed | |6 a | |0 great | |2 show | ."
but |2 food | |5 is | |1 always | |0 available | and |3 it | |5 is | |1 consistently | |0 good | .
|3 I | |4 think | |3 I | |4 gained | three |2 pounds | in |3 my | |2 week | |0 long | |2 cruise | .
"|3 This | |5 is | about |3 my | |2 farrier | , |2 girls | ."
|3 That | |4 's | |1 why | |3 I | |5 'm | |4 posting | |1 here | !
|2 Help | ?
"|3 I | |4 posted | |3 this | in |2 singles | and |2 dating | |1 too | , |1 so | |3 I | |5 've | |1 just | |4 copied | and |4 pasted | ."
"Well , |3 I | |5 'll | |4 try | to |4 make | |3 this | |0 short | ."
"|3 I | |5 have | |4 known | |6 this | |2 guy | for |6 a | |0 long | |2 time | , but |3 we | |5 've | |1 never | |5 been | |0 good | |2 friends | or |3 anything | ."
|3 He | |5 is | |3 my | |2 farrier | ( |4 shoes | |3 my | |2 horse | s |2 feet | ) |1 so | |3 I | |5 am | |1 technically | |6 a | |2 client | if |3 you | |4 want | to |4 view | |3 it | |6 that | |2 way | .
"Well , |1 almost | two |2 weeks | |1 ago | |3 he | |4 came | |1 out | and |4 did | |3 my | |2 horse | s |2 feet | and |5 was | |1 SO | |0 flirty | ."
"|3 He | |1 always | |4 hugs | |3 me | |1 when | |3 he | |4 comes | , but |3 he | |4 gave | |3 me | |1 at | |1 least | 5 |0 tight | , |0 long | , |2 back | |4 rubbing | |2 hugs | while |3 he | |5 was | |1 there | ."
|3 We | |5 were | |1 also | |1 just | |4 talking | about |3 my | |2 horse | 's |0 crappy | |2 feet | and |3 he | |4 mentioned | .
""" Well , if |3 you | |1 ever | |1 just | |4 want | to |4 see | |3 me | |3 I | |5 'll | |4 come | |1 out | and |4 look | |3 him | over and |1 then | |3 we | |5 can | |4 grab | |6 a | |2 coffee | |1 after | . """
|3 That | |5 has | |1 NEVER | |4 happened | |1 before | |1 so | |3 I | |5 was | |1 kinda | |4 realizing | at |6 that | |2 point | that |3 he | |5 was | |6 a | |0 little | |0 interested | .
Right ??
"Anyway , |1 so | |3 he | |4 ended | up |4 leaving | one |2 nail | out of |3 my | |2 horse | s |2 foot | ( |3 I | |5 've | |1 never | |4 heard | of |6 a | |2 farrier | |4 doing | |3 this | ) and |4 telling | |3 me | to |4 call | |3 him | in |6 a | |0 few | |2 days | ( |1 first | |3 it | |5 was | |6 a | |2 week | , |1 then | |3 it | |5 was | |6 a | |0 few | |2 days | lol ) and |3 he | |5 'd | |4 come | |1 back | |1 out | and |4 put | |3 it | |1 in | ."
|3 He | |4 told | |3 me | to |4 remember | to |4 call | like 3 |2 times | before |3 he | |4 left | .
"|1 So | , |3 I | |4 waited | |6 a | |2 week | to |4 call | because |3 I | |5 was | |0 busy | and |3 I | |4 wanted | to |4 have | |3 him | |4 come | |1 out | on |6 a | |2 day | |1 when | |3 I | |5 am | |1 more | |0 available | in |2 case | |3 we | |4 were | to |4 hang | out |1 after | ;)"
"Anyway , |1 so | |3 that | |5 was | 2 |2 days | |1 ago | |1 that | |3 I | |4 called | and |4 left | |6 a | |2 message | , but |3 he | |1 still | |5 has | n't |4 called | back |1 yet | ."
|3 I | |5 do | n't |4 know | if |3 I | |5 should | |4 call | |3 him | |1 again | |2 tomorrow | or not ?
"|3 I | |4 know | |6 a | |2 lot | of |2 people | |4 say | to |4 wait | until |3 he | |4 calls | |3 you | , but |3 it | |5 's | |0 different | because |3 I | |5 'm | |6 a | |2 client | and |1 technically | |3 that | |5 's | |6 all | |3 I | |5 am | at |6 this | |2 point | ."
"On |6 the | |0 other | |2 hand | |1 though | , if |3 I | |5 'm | |6 a | |2 client | |3 he | |5 should | |1 really | |5 of | |4 called | back by |1 now | because |3 you | |5 do | n't |4 leave | |6 a | |2 customer | |4 hanging | ."
|3 He | |5 did | n't |4 have | |3 my | |2 number | |1 either | because |3 this | |5 was | |6 the | |0 first | |2 time | |3 I | |5 've | |4 called | |3 HIM | |1 instead | of |3 his | |2 dad | .
|3 It | |5 's | |6 a | |2 father | and |2 son | |2 business | .
"Anyway , |3 I | |5 would | |4 appreciate | |6 ANY | |2 insight | on |3 this | |1 at | |1 all | ."
|4 Thank | |3 you | for |2 reading | if |3 you | |4 did | ! :)
"Ok , well |1 as | |1 far | as |3 him | |5 being | |6 a | |0 bad | |2 farrier | for |4 leaving | |6 a | |2 nail | |1 out | - |3 That | |5 is | not |6 the | |2 case | , |3 they | |5 are | |1 extremely | |1 well | |4 known | |2 farriers | in |6 the | |2 area | ."
|3 I | |5 would | |5 be | |6 a | |2 lot | |1 more | |0 concerned | if |6 the | |2 shoe | |4 fell | |1 off | because |3 it | |5 was | |4 missing | one |0 lousy | |2 nail | .
"|6 The | |2 reason | |3 he | |4 said | |3 he | |5 did | n't |4 put | |6 that | |2 nail | |1 in | |4 was | because |3 he | "" |5 did | n't |4 want | to |4 risk | |3 it | "" with |3 my | |2 horse | 's |0 horrible | |2 feet | ."
|3 This | |5 is | |1 about | |6 the | |0 fourth | |2 time | |3 they | |5 've | |4 done | |3 my | |2 horse | 's |2 feet | because |3 I | |1 just | |4 switched | |1 back | to |3 them | .
|6 The | |0 only | |2 reason | |3 I | |4 switched | |1 away | from |3 them | in |6 the | |0 first | |2 place | |4 is | because |3 my | |0 good | |2 friend | |3 who | |4 apprenticed | with |3 them | |5 was | |4 starting | out on |3 his | |0 own | .
"|1 However | , |3 he | |4 left | |3 my | |2 horse | without |6 a | |2 shoe | for TWO |2 WEEKS | ( |1 now | |3 that | |4 's | |3 what | |3 I | |4 call | |6 a | |0 crap | |2 farrier | ) ."
"|3 Which | , |3 I | |5 might | |4 add | |5 is | |6 the | |0 same | |2 foot | |3 that | |4 keeps | |4 crumbling | with |6 the | |2 nails | ."
"|1 So | , |1 obviously | |3 I | |4 switched | |1 back | to |6 these | |2 guys | ."
"Ok , |4 calm | down , |3 it | |4 's | not like |3 he | |5 's | |6 some | |2 stranger | |3 that | |4 came | |1 up | and |4 groped | |3 me | lol ."
|3 I | |5 've | |4 known | |6 the | |2 guy | for |1 about | 10 |2 years | .
"|3 I | |5 am | 21 , |1 so | yeah |3 we | |5 were | |1 both | |2 kids | |1 when | |3 we | |4 knew | |6 each | |0 other | !"
|3 He | |5 is | |6 a | |0 few | |2 years | |0 older | than |3 me | .
"And yes , |3 I | |5 do | |4 like | |3 him | ."
"To |4 answer | |7 Barry | |7 White | , yes |3 that | |5 did | |4 occur | to |3 me | :) |3 I | |4 hope | |3 that | |5 is | |6 all | |3 he | |5 's | |4 waiting | for ."
"On |6 the | |0 other | |2 hand | , |3 he | |5 could | |1 very | |1 easily | |1 just | |4 call | |3 me | and |4 say | hey |3 I | |5 'm | |0 busy | |1 right | |1 now | , |3 I | |5 'll | |4 call | |3 you | |1 when | |3 I | |5 can | |4 come | |1 out | ."
"And |1 as | |1 far | as |4 scheduled | |2 visits | |4 go | , |3 I | |4 have | |6 no | |2 idea | ."
|3 I | |5 've | |1 never | |4 done | |3 that | |1 before | |1 though | |1 either | .
"|3 It | |4 's | |1 always | |1 just | "" Okay , |3 they're | |2 feet | |4 need | to |5 be | |4 done | , |1 better | |4 call | |6 the | |2 farrier | . """
And |3 they | |1 usually | |4 come | |1 out | within |6 a | |0 few | |2 days | .
|3 He | |5 will | |4 call | |3 you | back |3 I | |5 m | |0 sure | !
|4 Sounds | like |3 He | |1 really | |4 likes | |3 you | ..
But |3 you | |4 need | to |4 ask | |3 yourself | |5 do | |3 you | |4 feel | |6 the | |0 same | |2 way | ?
|5 would | |3 You | |4 like | |4 going | for * |2 coffee | * with |3 him | ?
or |5 is | |3 he | Not |3 your | |2 type | ?
Or |5 are | |3 you | |0 undecided | ?

|3 I | |4 think | |3 he | |4 left | |6 the | |2 Nail | out of |6 the | |2 shoe | as |6 a | |2 excuse | to |4 come | |1 back | and |4 see | |3 you | hey |3 he | |5 may | |5 be | |3 your | |7 Prince | |7 charming | ..
|2 Edit | ... |3 I | |1 really | |5 do | nt |4 think | |3 Your | |2 horse | |5 Is | in |2 danger | Of |5 being | |4 hurt | With one |2 Nail | |4 missing | ..
|3 I | |5 have | |4 seen | |2 horses | |4 Loose | |2 Nails | On |3 there | |0 Own | And |4 do | |1 just | |1 fine | with ONE |2 nail | |4 gone | |1 Now | if |3 he | |5 had | |4 left | |1 out | 2 or 3 |3 I | |5 would | |5 be | |4 wondering | |1 to | ...
|3 I | |1 really | |5 do | |4 belive | |3 he | |4 left | |6 the | |2 nail | |1 out | becuse of |6 the | |2 horse | s |2 Hoof | |2 condition | and |3 It | |5 s | |6 a | |4 added | |2 bonus | |3 he | |5 would | |4 get | to |4 see | |3 her | |1 again |

|1 sort | |1 a | |4 wonder | |3 what | |3 it | |5 would | |5 have | |5 been | like ?
But |3 That | |5 was | |2 Years | |1 ago | .
|3 He | |4 had | |6 this | |2 Habit | of |4 telling | |3 you | |3 Everything | ..

Well 6 |2 weeks | |1 Later | |1 when | |3 he | |4 came | |1 back | |1 out | |3 He | |5 was | |1 again | |4 working | on |3 my | |2 mare | s |0 front | |7 Foot | and |3 I | |4 looked | |1 Down | and Yeah |3 he | |4 had | |2 Wholes | In |3 his | |2 pants | In |6 the | |0 wrong | |2 places | |3 I | |4 bust | out |4 Laughing | and |3 He | |5 was | like |3 what | ???

|3 that | |5 was | |6 a | |0 strange | |2 way | to |4 flirt | .. but |3 i | |4 guss | |3 it | |5 was | |3 his | |2 way | ...
But like |3 i | |4 said | |3 nothing | |1 ever | |4 came | of |3 It | .. |6 the | |0 next | |2 time | |3 I | |4 saw | |3 him | |3 He | |5 had | |4 told | |3 Me | |3 he | |4 had | To |5 get | |4 married | to |6 a | |2 girl | |3 Who | |3 he | |4 worked | with becuse |3 he | |4 knocked | |3 Her | Up ..
|3 I | |5 was | |0 heartbroken | .. but |1 then | |4 realized | |3 He | |5 was | not |6 the | |2 Guy | for |3 me | ..
"Wow |3 he | |5 does | |4 sound | |0 interested | in |3 you | , |3 my | |2 farrier | |1 never | |4 gives | |3 me | |2 hugs | like |3 that | ( |1 probably | |6 a | |0 good | |2 thing | as |3 he | |4 has | |6 a | |2 wife | and 2 |2 kids | ) anyway , |3 I | |4 find | that |3 they | |5 can | |5 be | |1 very | |0 busy | |1 so | |3 I | |5 would | |4 wait | |6 a | |2 week | |1 lo9nger | and if |1 still | |6 no | |2 reply | |4 give | |3 him | |6 a | |2 call | but |5 do | n’t |4 leave | |6 a | |2 message | so |3 you | |5 do | n’t |4 have | to |1 necessarily | |4 wait | for |3 him | to |4 call | ."
"From |6 the | |2 point | of |2 view | of |6 a | |2 business | , and |2 client | / |2 operator | |2 relationships | , |3 he | |5 's | |4 doing | |6 a | |1 really | |0 shitty | |2 job | ."
|4 Leaving | |2 nails | |1 out | so |3 you | |5 'll | |4 call | and |4 have | |3 him | |4 come | |1 back | |1 out | |1 later | ?
"|0 Cute | or not , |3 I | |5 'd | |4 call | |6 a | |0 different | |2 bloke | because |3 he | |5 's | |4 doing | |6 a | |0 sub-par | |2 job | at |3 something | |3 he | |4 needs | to |5 be | |4 doing | |3 his | |0 best | at , whether |3 he | |5 's | |4 flirting | or |4 trying | to |4 ask | |3 you | |1 out | or not , |3 he | |5 ought | to |4 put | |2 quality | |1 first | ."
"|3 This | |5 is | , |1 after | |1 all | , |3 his | |2 business | , and if |3 he | |4 wants | |3 you | to |4 remain | |6 a | |2 customer | |1 why | on |2 earth | |5 is | |3 he | |4 doing | |0 shoddy | |2 work | ?"
"|2 EPM | , |3 Anyone | |4 Dealt | with |3 it | ?"
|5 Might | |5 be | |3 something | |0 different | ?
|3 I | |4 have | |6 the | |2 opportunity | to |4 pick | up |6 a | |1 super | |0 nice | 6 |2 year | |2 old | for |0 free | .
"|3 He | |5 's | not |0 lame | , but |3 he | |5 's | |5 been | |4 having | |2 issues | ."
|1 Here | |5 's | |3 what | |6 the | |2 owner | |5 has | |4 said | :
|3 I | |4 have | |6 a | 5 |2 year | |2 old | |3 that | |4 lost | |6 all | of |3 his | |2 cheek | |2 muscle | on |6 the | |0 right | |2 side | about 3 - 4 |2 months | |1 ago | .
"|3 I | |4 chalked | |3 it | up to |0 possible | |0 nerve | |2 damage | , because |3 this | |5 is | |3 what | |6 the | |2 vet | |4 thought | and |6 the | |0 other | |2 cheek | |2 muscle | |5 was | |0 fine | and |3 he | |4 had | |6 no | |2 theeth | |2 problems | ."
|1 So | |3 I | |4 sent | |3 him | to |6 the | |2 trainers | |6 the | |2 first | of |7 September | to |5 be | |4 started | on |6 the | |2 barrels | .
|3 I | |4 got | |3 him | |1 back | |6 the | |2 first | of |6 the | |2 month | and |3 he | |5 had | |4 lost | |6 some | |2 weight | but |4 attributed | |3 that | to |5 be | |4 worked | |2 everyday | ( |3 I | |4 expected | |3 him | to |4 drop | |6 some | ) .
|3 He | |5 is | |1 now | |4 losing | |6 the | |2 cheek | |2 muscle | on |6 the | |0 left | |2 side | of |3 his | |2 face | and |4 seems | to |5 be | |4 dropping | |2 weight | by |6 the | |2 day | .
|4 Had | |3 him | to |6 a | |2 dentist | |2 yesterday | and |3 there | |4 is | |6 no | |2 teeth | |2 problems | .
"|3 He | |5 can | |4 eat | |6 all | |3 his | |2 feed | and |5 does | n't |4 drop | |6 any | , but |5 can | not |4 eat | |2 hay | from |2 lack | of |2 muscle | to |4 chew | |3 it | ."
|3 He | |5 is | |0 gant | |4 looking | in |3 his | |2 flank | |2 area | and |5 is | |4 losing | |2 topline | |2 muscle | .
|6 The | |0 only | |0 neurological | |2 sign | |6 that | |3 he | |4 shows | |4 is | that |3 he | |1 barely | |4 drags | |3 his | |2 toes | and |1 sometimes | |4 has | |0 trouble | with |3 his | |0 right | |2 lead | .
|6 The | |2 horse | |3 I | |5 had | |4 posted | about |6 a | |2 couple | |2 weeks | |1 ago | with |6 the | |4 atrophied | |2 cheek | |2 muscles | |5 is | down to |3 his | |0 last | |2 resort | for |2 life | .
|3 I | |5 CAN | NOT |4 afford | to |4 treat | |3 whatever | |5 is | |0 wrong | with |3 him | .
"NO , |3 I | |5 have | not |4 done | |6 an | |2 EPM | |2 test | but |5 have | |4 done | |6 an | |0 extensive | |2 blood | |2 panel | and |3 my | |2 vet | |4 did | |6 a | |0 neurological | |0 physical | |2 exam | ."
|3 We | |4 elected | to not |4 do | |6 the | |2 EPM | |2 test | because |3 there | |4 was | |6 NO | |0 neurological | |2 signs | .
"|3 He | |5 is | |1 still | |4 showing | |6 no | |2 signs | |0 other | than |6 the | |2 weight | |2 loss | , and |6 some | |2 muscle | |2 atrophy | ."
|3 He | |4 eats | |6 all | of |3 his | |2 grain | but |3 it | |1 just | |4 takes | |3 him | |6 a | |2 while | to |4 get | |3 it | |4 chewed | because of |6 the | |2 lack | of |2 muscle | in |3 his | |2 jaws | .
|1 So | |3 I | |5 might | |4 get | |6 the | |2 horse | and |4 see | |3 what | |3 I | |5 can | |4 do | .
"|3 I | |5 will | |5 be | |4 getting | with |3 my | |2 vet | |1 first | and if |3 I | |5 do | |4 get | |3 him | , |4 have | |6 the | |0 spinal | |2 fluid | |2 test | |4 done | for |2 EPM | and |6 a | |2 titer | |2 test | ."
|5 Will | |5 be | |4 getting | |6 a | |2 copy | of |6 the | |2 blood | |2 results | |6 the | |2 owner | |5 has | |1 already | |4 ran | |1 as | |1 well | .
|3 My | |0 other | |2 theory | |5 would | |5 be | |2 wobblers | .
|3 I | |5 'll | |5 be | |4 having | |3 my | |0 equine | |2 chiro | / |2 acupuncturist | |1 out | to |4 do | |6 some | |2 work | |1 as | |1 well | if |3 I | |5 do | |4 get | |3 him | ....
|1 So | |6 any | |2 ideas | ?
|4 Think | |3 I | |5 should | |4 do | |3 it | ?
"|7 Arby | ,"
|2 Horse | |5 is | out of |2 state | and not |0 local | .
|2 Owner | |5 is | |0 willing | to |4 meet | |3 me | half |1 way | with |3 him | .
|3 I | |5 will | |5 be | |4 calling | |3 my | |2 vet | and |2 chiro | about |3 him | .
"|0 Worse | |4 comes | to |0 worse | , |3 I | |5 'm | out of |6 the | $ $ and |4 have | to |4 put | |3 him | down |1 anyway | or |4 have | |6 a | |0 pretty | |2 pasture | |2 ornament | ."
|3 He | |5 's | |1 still | |0 rideable | |1 currently | and not |4 having | |0 many | |2 issues | under |2 saddle | .
|3 This | |5 is | |6 a | |2 horse | |3 that | |3 I | |1 otherwise | |5 would | n't |5 be | |0 able | to |4 afford | and |1 even | if |3 I | |4 spend | 2 K and |2 treatment | |3 I | |4 come | |1 out | ahead of |3 his | |2 purchase | |2 price | .
"|3 I | |4 posted | |3 what | |6 the | |2 owner | |5 as | |4 said | in |2 paragraph | 2 & 3 , |3 that | |5 is | not |3 me | to |4 clarify | ."
|3 She | |5 is | |6 the | |2 one | |3 that | |5 ca | n't |4 afford | to |4 do | |3 anything | |0 else | for |3 him | in |2 case | |3 he | |5 does | n't |4 recover | |1 fully | .
|3 He | |5 can | |4 eat | |2 grain | and |3 I | |1 already | |4 have | |6 a | |2 feed | |2 regimen | in |3 my | |2 head | for |6 the | |2 guy | since |3 he | |5 ca | n't |4 eat | |0 regular | |2 hay | .
|3 I | |5 do | n't |4 think | |3 it | |5 will | |5 be | |0 hard | to |4 keep | |3 his | |2 weight | |1 up | |1 so | |1 long | as |3 he | |5 can | |4 eat | |6 the | |2 grain | .
|3 I | |5 am | not |4 going | to |4 go | |4 pick | up |6 a | |2 horse | |3 I | |5 ca | n't |4 afford | .
|3 I | |5 am | |0 willing | to |4 pull | |6 the | |2 EPM | |2 test | and |4 treat | .

|7 July | |5 is | |1 when | |3 he | |4 started | to |4 exhibit | |0 slight | |2 symptoms | and |6 the | |2 owner | and |2 vet | |1 originally | |4 thought | |3 it | |5 was | |1 just | |6 some | |2 nerve | |2 damage | from |3 something | in |6 the | |2 pasture | with |6 no | |0 visible | |2 injury | .
"|3 He | |5 's | |1 only | |4 exhibited | |2 weight | |2 loss | and |6 some | |2 muscle | |2 atrophy | , with |6 the | |0 slight | |2 toe | |2 drag | and |6 a | |2 bit | of |2 trouble | with |6 the | |0 right | |2 lead | ( |3 which | |5 could | or |5 could | n't |5 be | |4 related | ) ."
|6 The | |2 horse | |5 is | not in |2 pain | .

|6 The | |2 horse | |5 is | not in |2 pain | .
|3 He | |5 's | not |4 starving | .
"|3 He | |5 's | |4 dropping | |2 weight | , but |1 most | of |3 that | |4 came | from |5 being | at |6 the | |2 trainer | s and |5 being | |4 ridden | |1 hard | for 60 |2 days | ."
|3 He | |5 's | not |4 putting | |3 it | |1 back | |1 on | .
|3 I | |4 know | that |3 I | |4 have | |6 the | |2 possibility | of |4 treating | |3 him | and |1 still | |4 having | to |4 put | |3 him | down .
At |6 the | |0 same | |2 time | |3 I | |5 do | |4 know | |2 people | |3 who | |5 have | |4 had | |2 horses | |4 come | |1 back | |1 successfully | after |2 EPM | .
|3 I | |4 know | |3 this | |5 is | |4 going | to |5 be | |0 expensive | .
|3 I | |5 'm | |0 willing | to |4 give | |3 it | |6 a | |2 shot | .
"|7 Gallop | , |3 I | |5 've | |1 already | |4 read | |6 that | |0 whole | |2 site | and |5 been | |4 reading | through |2 research | |2 articles | from |6 the | |2 research | |2 colleges | |1 as | |1 well | ."
"|4 Looked | at |2 studies | , |2 treatment | |2 options | and |0 such | ."
|3 I | |5 will | |4 have | |6 the | |2 EPM | |2 test | |4 done | before |4 treating | .
|6 The | |2 chiro | / |2 acupuncturist | |5 will | |5 be | |1 there | to |4 evaluate | |6 the | |2 horse | for |2 wobblers | |3 which | |5 is | |1 often | |4 caused | by |0 spinal | |2 compression | and |5 can | |5 be | |4 confused | with |2 EPM | .
If |3 that | |5 is | |6 the | |2 case | |1 then | |2 acupuncture | |5 is | n't |4 going | to |4 hurt | |3 him | .
|3 It | |5 's | |1 actually | one of |6 the | |0 alternative | |2 therapies | for |2 EPM |
|3 I | |4 think | |3 it | |5 is | |1 wonderfully | |0 responsible | that |3 you | |5 are | |4 going | into |6 this | |2 rescue | |2 eyes | |0 open | and |5 are | |4 getting | |6 the | |2 opinions | of |0 qualified | |2 professionals | ( and |6 a | |2 bunch | of |2 Yahoos | ) before |3 you | |4 decide | to |4 take | |6 this | |2 horse | on .
|3 I | |5 do | |4 think | |6 some | |7 Y!A | |2 users | |4 need | to |4 work | on |3 their | |2 reading | |2 comprehension | as |3 I | |5 ca | n't |4 comprehend | |1 how | |4 taking | |6 a | |2 horse | in as |6 a | |2 rescue | and |4 getting | |3 it | |0 qualified | |0 medical | |2 treatment | |5 is | |2 abuse | .
|0 Worst | |2 case | |2 scenario | |3 you | |4 fall | in |2 love | and after |4 spending | |2 thousands | of |2 dollars | |3 you | |4 have | to |4 put | |6 the | |2 horse | down .
|5 Is | |3 that | |3 something | |3 you | |5 are | up for ?
If |1 so | |4 go | for |3 it | and |3 I | |5 'll | |4 give | |3 you | |6 all | |6 the | |0 moral | |2 support | |3 I | |5 can | as |3 you | |4 figure | out |3 what | |5 is | |1 up | .
"|3 It | |5 is | |0 heartbreaking | to |4 try | to |4 bring | |6 a | |2 horse | back and |1 then | |4 have | to |4 put | |3 it | down , but |6 some | |2 horses | |5 are | |0 worth | |6 the | |2 risk | ."
If |3 you | |4 feel | |6 this | |2 guy | |5 is | |0 worth | |3 it | |1 then | |3 I | |4 hope | |3 your | |2 vet | |5 can | |4 figure | |2 things | out .
As to |2 EPM | like |7 Shee | |4 said | |5 being | in |7 MI | |3 we | |5 've | |4 had | to |4 deal | with |3 it | .
|1 Pretty | |1 much | |6 every | |0 large | |2 stable | |5 has | |1 here | .
|3 Our | |0 first | |4 diagnosed | |2 EPM | |2 horse | |4 was | |1 back | |1 when | |3 there | |4 was | |6 no | |2 treatment | in |6 the | |7 US | and |1 only | |6 an | |0 experimental | |2 chicken | |2 feed | |2 additive | in |7 Canada | .
|3 We | |4 hauled | |6 the | |2 horse | to |7 Windsor | and |4 got | |3 him | |4 treated | |1 there | .
|6 That | |2 horse | |4 returned | to |2 racing | and |3 we | |5 did | n't |4 notice | |0 much | |2 difference | .
"|3 We | |5 've | |4 had | |6 a | |0 few | since |1 then | , but |2 none | since |3 our | |2 race | |2 horses | |4 began | |4 wintering | in |7 Florida | ."
"|3 I | |4 have | |6 no | |2 idea | if |3 that | |5 is | |0 related | or |2 farmers | |5 are | |4 doing | |6 a | |0 better | |2 job | of |4 clearing | out |2 opossums | |1 now | because |3 they | |4 know | |2 opossums | |5 are | |2 carriers | , but |3 we | |5 have | n't |4 had | |6 an | |2 EPM | |2 horse | in |1 at | |1 least | 10 |2 years | ."
|3 I | |5 can | |4 say | |6 all | of |3 our | |2 EPM | |2 horses | |5 were | |4 treated | |1 early | |1 when | |3 they | |5 were | |4 showing | |0 mild | |2 signs | like |7 Shee | |4 gave | and |1 all | |4 returned | to |2 racing | .
One |2 horse | |1 even | |4 got | |3 his | |2 lifetime | |2 mark | after |5 being | |4 treated | for |2 EPM | .
|3 We | |5 've | |1 always | |4 liked | |0 big | |0 long | |2 trotters | |3 that | |4 do | |1 better | on |2 mile | |2 tracks | then 1 / 2 |2 mile | .
|6 The | |0 only | |2 difference | |3 we | |4 noticed | |4 is | that |6 the | |2 EPM | |2 horses | |4 seemed | to |4 do | |1 worse | on |6 the | |0 smaller | |2 tracks | |1 after | .
|3 It | |5 might | |1 just | |5 be | |2 coincidence | or |6 the | |2 fact | |6 those | |0 great | |0 big | |2 trotters | with |6 those | |1 extremely | |0 long | |2 backs | |4 lost | |6 a | |2 bit | of |0 fine | |2 coordination | to |4 get | |6 those | |0 gangly | |2 bodies | around |6 those | |0 tighter | |2 turns | .
|3 I | |5 do | n't |4 know | .
|7 MSU | |4 does | |6 a | |2 lot | of |2 EPM | |2 studies | because of |1 how | |0 common | |3 it | |5 is | |1 here | .
|3 You | |5 may | |4 want | to |4 see | if |3 you | |5 can | |4 get | in |2 touch | with |3 their | |2 EPM | |2 group | and |4 get | |6 this | |2 guy | in |6 a | |2 study | .
|3 I | |4 know | |3 they | |4 did | |0 lab | |2 work | |4 showing | that |7 Strongid | |7 C | |4 used | |1 daily | |5 could | |4 help | |4 prevent | |2 EPM | .
"|3 I | |4 believe | |3 they | |4 have | |6 a | |0 real | |2 study | |4 testing | |6 the | |0 lab | |2 work | in |0 real | |2 world | |2 situations | |1 now | , but |3 it | |5 may | |5 be | |6 some | |2 time | before |6 those | |2 results | |5 are | |4 released | ."
|6 Another | |2 thought | with |3 this | |5 being | |6 a | |2 mosquito | |2 season | from |2 hell | |5 could | |3 it | |5 be | |7 West | |7 Nile | ?
|7 West | |7 Nile | |5 can | |4 cause | |2 EPM | |0 like | |2 symptoms | and |5 does | n't |1 always | |4 include | |6 a | |2 fever | .
|4 Let | |3 us | |4 know | |3 what | |3 you | |4 decide | to |4 do | .
"|3 You | |4 hate | to |4 see | |0 talent | |5 get | |4 wasted | , but |1 honestly | |3 I | |5 do | n't |4 think | |3 I | |5 could | |4 take | in |6 a | |2 horse | |1 right | |1 now | |6 these | |2 issues | ."
|1 Personally | |3 I | |4 think | |3 you | |5 should | |1 just | |4 keep | on |4 walking | |1 by | .
|3 You | |5 should | |4 have | |3 you | |2 chiro | |1 out | before |3 you | |4 decide | if |3 you | |4 want | |6 this | |2 horse | or not .
"If |3 you | |4 have | |6 a | |0 good | |2 repoire | ( |3 which | |3 I | |5 'm | |0 sure | |3 you | |4 do | ) with |3 them | , |3 they | |5 should | |5 be | |0 honest | on if |6 this | |2 horse | |5 is | |0 fixable | to |6 any | |2 degree | ... not |1 really | |0 sure | |3 what | |3 you | |4 want | to |4 do | with |3 him | ..."
"|1 Even | if |3 you | |5 can | |4 figure | out |3 what | |5 is | |0 wrong | with |6 this | |0 poor | |2 poneh | , |3 there | |4 is | |1 always | |6 the | |2 chance | for |2 remission | and |1 then | |2 relapse | |1 so | |3 you | |5 may | |4 have | to |4 do | |4 deal | |1 with | |1 again | in |6 the | |2 future | ."
"|1 So | |6 all | in |6 all | , |4 put | |6 the | |2 money | up |2 front | before |4 taking | on |6 this | |2 horse | ."
|6 A | |0 few | |4 hundred | out of |2 pocket | |1 now | |5 will | |1 possibly | |4 save | |3 you | |2 thousands | once |6 the | |2 horse | |5 is | in |3 your | |2 name | .
|5 Could | |3 he | |5 have | |4 had | |6 a | |2 blow | to |6 the | |2 head | |4 causing | |6 this | |2 atrophy | ?
Or |6 a | |0 difficult | |2 birth | ?
|5 Was | |3 it | |1 always | like |3 this | ?
Or |5 has | |3 it | |4 occurred | since |2 birth | .
|3 I | |1 also | |4 wonder | if |3 he | |5 might | |5 have | |4 had | |6 a | |0 slight | |2 stroke | ?
|3 I | |4 think | if |3 you | |5 can | not |4 afford | to |4 get | |3 him | |4 treated | that |3 you | |5 should | not |4 consider | |3 him | as |6 a | |2 prospect | .
"|3 Who | |4 knows | |3 what | |6 the | |2 future | |5 might | |4 hold | , and |3 it | |5 might | |5 be | |0 expensive | ?"
|1 Extremely | |0 bad | |2 customer | |2 service |
"|5 Do | not |4 go | to |6 this | |2 salon | , |1 especially | if |3 you | |4 have | to |4 get | |3 your | |2 hair | |4 straightened | ."
|3 They | |4 did | |6 a | |1 very | |0 bad | |2 job | with |3 my | |2 hair | and |5 were | |1 extremely | |0 rude | |1 when | |3 I | |4 went | |1 back | to |4 ask | |3 them | |1 why | |3 it | |5 did | n't |4 work | for |3 my | |2 hair | .

|3 I | |5 can | |4 rent | |6 another | |2 machine | for |1 like | $ 60 |3 that | |5 will | |4 give | |3 it | |6 a | |4 finished | |2 look | .

|3 They | |4 worked | around |6 the | |2 clock | to |4 ensure | that |3 my | |2 puppy | |2 life | |5 was | |4 saved | .
|3 We | |4 have | to |4 leave | |3 him | at |6 the | |2 vet | for 3 |2 days | and |3 I | |5 was | |4 told | to |4 call | for |2 check | |2 ups | |1 as | |1 often | as |3 I | |4 wished | that |1 no | |1 matter | |1 how | |0 many | |2 times | |3 I | |4 called | |3 I | |5 would | not |4 annoy | |3 them | .

|3 I | |5 would | |1 strongly | |4 suggest | |3 you | |4 give | |3 them | |6 the | |2 chance | to |4 prove | to |3 you | that |1 not | |6 all | |2 people | in |6 this | |2 world | |5 are | |0 evil | !
|3 I | |5 will | |1 never | |4 go | to |6 another | |2 vet | |1 as | |1 long | as |3 I | |4 have | |2 animals | .
|3 I | |4 live | |1 nearly | two |2 hours | |1 away | and yet |3 I | |5 will | |1 still | |4 make | |6 the | |2 drive | to |4 see | |3 them | !
In |2 fact | |3 I | |4 look | |1 forward | to |4 taking | |3 my | |2 animals | to |6 the | |2 vet | |1 simply | because of |1 how | |3 my | |2 animals | and |3 I | |5 are | |4 treated | .

"In |6 some | |2 cases | |6 the | |2 result | |5 is | because of |2 understaffing | , in |6 some | |2 cases | |6 the | |2 staff | |1 just | |5 does | n't |4 care | / |4 know | |1 better | ."
"|3 They | |5 must | |1 also | |4 get | |3 something | to |4 keep | |2 take | - |2 out | |0 warm | , so |3 it | |5 's | not |2 room | |2 temperature | |1 at | |1 best | |1 when | |3 you | |4 get | |3 it | |1 home | ."

|6 the | |2 staff | |5 is | |1 very | |0 personable | & |1 actually | |4 care | about |6 the | |2 customers | |2 safety | |1 rather | than |4 taking | |3 there | |2 money | .
|3 This | |5 is | |1 however | |6 a | |1 very | |0 busy | |2 shop | but |3 there | |4 are | |2 appointments | |0 available | & |6 the | |2 staff | up |2 front | |5 will | |1 surely | |4 make | |0 sure | |3 you | |4 get | |1 back | in |6 a | |0 timely | |2 manner | .
|3 I | |4 look | at |6 some | of |6 these | |0 other | |2 comments | & |4 laugh | because |2 people | |4 think | that |6 the | |2 world | |4 revolves | around |3 them | !

"|1 Additionally | |3 we | |4 tried | |6 the | |7 Logan | |7 Circle | |2 roll | , |0 spicy | |2 crab | and |2 tuna | |2 roll | , and |0 sweet | |2 potato | |2 tempura | |2 roll | ( $ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3.75 |1 respectively | ) ."

|6 The | |0 bottom | |2 line | |4 is | that |6 the | |2 food | |5 is | n't |0 great | and |5 is | |1 relatively | |0 high | - |0 priced | .

|5 Do | n't |4 Expect | |2 Sleep | or |2 Courtesy |

|3 I | |4 called | |6 the | |0 front | |2 desk | and |4 got | |6 no | |2 answer | .

"|3 He | |1 finally | |4 admitted | that |1 only | |6 the | 4 |2 ADA | |2 room | |2 alarms | |5 had | |4 sounded | , |1 so | |1 only | 4 |2 guests | |5 were | |4 effected | ( |6 no | |0 big | |2 deal | to |3 him | ) ."

"|6 This | |2 hotel | |5 is | |0 adequate | |0 enough | , but |3 there | |4 is | |6 an | |0 obvious | |2 problem | with |6 the | |2 staff | and |2 management | ."
|5 Do | not |4 go | |1 there | if |3 you | |4 expect | to |4 sleep | through |6 the | |2 night | .
"|0 Poor | |2 Service | , |2 Lack | of |2 Passion | : |5 Do | NOT |4 go |"
"|3 I | |4 began | |4 seeing | |7 Dr. | |7 Romanick | |1 back | in 2000 and |5 have | |4 seen | |6 a | |0 significant | |2 decline | in |6 the | |2 quality | of |2 care | , |2 patient | - |2 doctor | |2 communication | , and |1 just | |6 the | |0 overall | |2 level | of |2 services | ."
"|6 The | |0 poor | |2 quality | |4 starts | at |6 the | |2 receptionist | |2 desk | , |1 where | |6 the | |2 staff | |5 is | |1 very | |0 impatient | and |4 lack | |6 the | |2 efficiency | |3 I | |1 once | |4 loved | about |6 the | |2 office | ."
"|3 It | |4 took | |3 them | |1 nearly | two |2 months | to |4 complete | |6 a | |0 simple | |2 task | , and |0 countless | |2 calls | from |3 my | |2 part | due to |3 their | |2 lack | of |2 response | and |2 passion | ( not that |3 it | |5 's | |6 a | |2 requirement | for |6 the | |2 job | , but |3 it | |4 helps | to |1 at | |1 least | |4 pretend | to |5 be | |0 helpful | ) ."
"|1 Also | , |3 I | |5 was | |4 promised | to |4 have | |3 my | |2 test | |2 results | |4 emailed | to |3 me | , but |3 it | |1 never | |4 happened | , and after |6 a | |0 few | |2 attempts | to |4 get | |7 Dr. | |7 Romanick | on |6 the | |2 phone | to |4 brief | |3 me | on |3 my | |2 condition | , |3 I | |1 finally | |4 gave | up and |4 went | to |6 a | |0 different | |2 doctor | ."

|1 When | |6 the | |2 guys | |4 arrived | ( 2 |2 hours | |1 later | than |4 agreed | ) |3 they | |4 told | that |3 you | |4 have | to |4 pay | |6 all | |6 the | |2 tolls | |3 they | |4 payed | |4 coming | from |7 Brooklyn | and |0 extra | $ 100 for |3 them | to |4 drive | |1 back | from |3 your | |2 destination | .

"|4 Guess | |3 what | , |5 was | not in |6 the | |0 initial | |2 agreement | |1 as | |1 well | ."

|1 So | |3 I | |1 still | |5 can | |4 recomend | |3 them | but |4 prepare | |4 pay | |1 twice | |1 as | |0 much | as |3 they | |4 tell | |3 you | |1 initially | .
"One |0 more | |2 thing | , |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 take | |6 any | |2 credit | |2 cards | or |2 checks | ."

"|3 I | |5 will | |1 probably | |4 stay | |1 here | |1 again | because |3 it | |5 s | |0 cheap | and |3 I | |5 ca | nt |4 afford | |6 a | |0 better | |2 hotel | , but |5 do | not |4 look | |1 forward | to |3 it | and |5 would | |1 definitely | not |4 recommend | |6 this | |2 hotel | for |2 families | or |0 single | |0 female | |2 travellers | ."
|5 Was | |1 there | |6 this | |0 past | |2 weekend | and |6 the | |2 guy | behind |6 the | |2 counter | |4 yelled | at |3 me | and |3 my | |2 son | because |3 we | |4 believed | |3 he | |4 left | |6 the | |2 grandma | |2 slice | in |6 the | |2 oven | |6 a | |0 little | |1 too | |1 long | and |6 the | |2 cheese | |5 got | |1 all | |4 dried | out and |6 the | |2 slice | |4 tasted | |1 more | like |6 a | |2 cracker | .
"|3 He | |4 preceded | to |4 grab | |6 the | |2 slice | off |6 the | |2 countertop | and |4 throw | |3 it | into |6 the | |2 trash | while |4 yelling | at |3 me | |4 saying | , "" |3 you | |5 do | not |4 order | |3 what | |3 you | |5 do | not |4 know | about "" and "" |3 you | |5 do | n't |4 know | |1 how | |2 pizza | |5 is | |4 made | "" ."
|3 It | |5 was | |1 very | |0 upsetting | to |4 see | |6 this | |2 kind | of |2 behavior | |1 especially | in |2 front | of |3 my | four |2 year | |0 old | .
"|3 He | |5 was | in |6 the | |2 process | of |4 making | |3 me | |6 a | |2 pie | and |1 when | |3 I | |4 got | |1 home | , |6 the | |2 pie | |5 was | |6 the | |0 worst | |3 I | |5 have | |1 ever | |4 seen | ."
"|2 Cheese | |5 was | |4 falling | |1 off | , |1 so | |0 oily | and |0 greasy | ."
"|3 I | |4 think | |3 he | |4 did | |3 it | on |2 purpose | because of |3 my | |0 simple | |2 request | for |6 another | |2 slice | of |2 grandma | |3 that | |5 was | n't |1 so | |1 well | - |0 done | ( |1 actually | , |0 burnt | ) ."
|3 I | |5 will | |1 never | |4 go | |1 back | to |6 this | |2 place | and |3 I | |5 am | |4 reporting | |3 them | to |6 the | |0 better | |2 business | |2 bureau | for |0 such | |0 horrible | |2 customer | |2 relations | and |1 basically | |4 sabotaging | |3 my | |2 pizza | and |4 taking | |3 my | $ 25 .

"|0 Long | |2 Lines | , |0 Silly | |2 Rules | , |0 Rude | |2 Staff | , |0 Ok | |2 Food |"
|6 The | |0 first | |2 thing | |3 you | |4 notice | |1 when | |3 you | |4 arrive | on |2 location | |4 is | that |6 the | |2 waiting | |2 line | |1 literally | |4 goes | out |6 the | |2 door | and |4 spills | into |6 the | |2 parking | |2 lot | .
"|6 A | |2 restaurant | with |6 this | |0 many | |2 patrons | |0 willing | to |4 stand | in |2 line | |1 just | to |4 order | |2 tacos | |5 must | |5 be | |0 good | , right ?"
"|3 I | |4 mean | , |3 that | |5 's | |6 the | |2 way | |3 it | |4 works | at |2 amusement | |2 parks | : |6 the | |0 longest | |2 lines | |5 are | at |6 the | |0 best | |2 rides | ."

"|6 The | |2 staff | |4 taking | |3 your | |2 order | and "" |4 waiting | "" on |3 you | |5 are | |1 very | |0 indifferent | and |4 have | |6 no | |2 sense | of |2 costumer | |2 service | |1 at | |1 all | ."
|3 I | |5 have | |4 gotten | |0 better | |2 results | |4 talking | to |7 COMCAST | |2 customer | |2 service | than with |6 these | |2 folks | .
"And |5 do | n't |1 even | |4 think | about |4 asking | to |4 speak | to |6 the | |2 manager | because |6 this | |2 guy | |5 is | , and |4 pardon | |3 my | |7 French | , |6 a | |2 jerk | ."
"If |3 you | |5 have | |4 gotten | through |2 ordering | , |4 dealing | with |6 the | |0 rude | |2 staff | and if |3 you | |4 followed | |6 the | |0 dumb | |2 rules | , |3 you | |5 are | |1 finally | |4 presented | with |3 what | |3 you | |4 came | for .. |6 some | |2 tacos | |3 that | |5 are | "" |0 ok | , "" but |1 definitely | |1 not | |0 worth | |4 putting | up with |6 all | |6 the | |2 hassle | ."
|4 Save | |3 yourself | |6 the | |2 trouble | and |4 skip | |6 this | |2 place | all |1 together | .
|3 I | |4 suggest | |3 you | |4 go | |1 up | to |4 Raging | |7 Taco | & |4 Raging | |7 Burrito | |6 a | |2 couple | of |2 blocks | up |6 the | |2 street | or |1 even | |7 Taco | |7 Mac | .

|3 I | |1 rrly | |4 seek | |6 the | |2 cehf | out to |4 introduce | |3 myself | -- but |6 the | |0 second | |2 time | |3 we | |4 went | -- |3 i | |4 made | |6 a | |2 point | of |4 asking | |3 our | |2 wait | |2 person | to |4 introduce | |3 my | |2 friend | and |3 myself | to |6 the | |2 chef | to |4 tell | |3 him | |1 just | |1 how | |0 good | |3 our | |2 meals | |5 were | .

- |7 R. | |7 Morris | .
|3 I | |4 think | that |3 the | |5 re | |1 pretty | |0 good | .
"|1 First | of |6 all | , if |3 you | |4 call | for |6 an | |2 appointment | |3 they | |5 wo | n't |4 tell | |3 you | to |4 call | |1 back | |6 a | |2 month | |1 later | so |3 you | |5 can | |1 then | |4 make | one ."

|3 I | |4 feel | that |6 the | |2 way | |6 some | |2 doctor | s |2 offices | |4 work | around |1 here | |5 is | |6 a | |0 little | |2 bit | |0 absurd | |1 so | |3 I | |5 'm | |0 happy | that |6 these | |2 guys | |5 do | n't |4 do | |6 those | two |2 things | in |0 particlular | .
|1 Usually | |3 you | |5 can | |5 be | |4 seen | |6 the | |0 same | |2 week | or |1 maybe | |6 the | |4 following | |2 week | .
|6 The | |2 doctor | |5 did | |4 tell | |3 me | that |3 my | |0 male | |2 pattern | |2 baldness | |5 is | due to |3 my | |2 mother | s |2 father | because |6 the | |2 gene | |5 is | |1 exclusively | |4 passed | on through |0 maternal | |2 line | but |3 that | |5 's | |6 a | |0 common | |2 misconception | ( http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm ) .

|3 This | |5 can | |4 tend | to |5 be | |6 a | |0 stressful | |2 experience | in |3 itself | |4 let | |1 alone | |4 adding | |4 crossing | |2 boarders | for |6 the | |0 first | |2 time | .
|3 I | |5 was | |1 very | |0 pleased | to |4 find | |3 my | |2 accommodations | and |6 the | |2 hotel | |2 staff | to |5 be | |6 a | |1 very | |0 calming | and |0 comforting | |2 part | of |3 my | |2 trip | .

|3 I | |5 was | |1 just | |1 in | |0 last | |2 night | and |4 had | |6 a | |2 chance | to |4 dine | in |3 their | |0 new | |2 dining | |2 room | .
|0 AMAZING | !
|3 I | |4 frequent | |6 this | |2 resturant | on |6 a | |0 weekly | |2 basis | but |1 usally | |1 only | for |2 lunch | .
"Well |3 I | |5 was | in for |6 a | |2 treat | |1 when | |3 I | |5 was | |4 greeted | by |6 the | |0 friendly | |2 girls | at |6 the | |2 counter | |3 who | |4 asked | if |3 my | |2 wife | and |3 I | |5 would | |4 like | to |4 sit | in |3 their | "" |0 new | "" |2 dining | |2 room | ."
|1 Right | |1 away | |3 they | |4 told | |3 us | that |3 it | |5 was | |6 the | |0 same | |0 great | |2 food | with |6 the | |0 same | |2 prices | |1 so | |1 off | |3 we | |4 went | .
|3 We | |5 were | |4 greeted | |1 again | and |4 sat | |1 promptly | .
"After |4 looking | at |6 the | |2 menu | and |4 seeing | |6 the | |0 new | |2 menu | |2 items | |3 they | |4 had | , |3 we | |4 knew | |3 we | |5 were | in for |6 a | |2 treat | !"
|3 I | |4 had | |6 the | |2 Chicken | |2 Parmesan | |2 Dinner | and |3 my | |2 wife | |4 had | |6 the | |2 Shrimp | |2 Scampi | |2 Dinner | .
|0 AMAZING | !
|6 The | |2 portions | |5 were | |0 generous | |1 enough | that |3 we | |1 even | |4 took | |6 some | |1 home | !
|3 I | |4 have | to |4 say | |6 the | |2 value | of |6 this | |2 place | |1 always | |4 amazes | |3 me | .
"|3 It | |5 's | |0 nice | to |4 see | that |1 even | in |6 the | |2 economy | |3 we | |5 can | |4 eat | |6 a | |2 place | |3 that | |4 has | |0 upscale | |2 service | , |0 amazing | |2 atmosphere | , and |0 Incredible | |2 food | , but not |4 break | |6 the | |2 bank | while |4 enjoying | |3 it | !"
|0 Bottom | |2 line | |4 is | that |1 when | |3 it | |5 's | |6 a | |0 small | |1 privatly | |4 owned | |2 resturant | like |3 this | |4 is | |3 you | |5 can | |4 tell | that |6 the | |2 owners | and |2 employees | |4 take | |2 pride | in |3 their | |2 product | and |2 service | .
|1 Well | |4 Done | !
|0 Great | |2 work | and |0 honest | |2 establishment | !
"|3 I | |1 typically | |4 have | |2 work | |4 done | on |3 my | |7 Jeep | at |6 the | |2 dealership | , but |3 it | |5 is | 6 |2 years | |0 old | |1 now | and |5 getting | |4 charged | |2 dealership | |2 prices | |1 just | |5 did | n't |4 seem | |2 cost | |0 effective | |1 anymore | ."
|3 I | |5 had | |4 tried | out |0 few | |2 place | around |6 the | |2 area | and |5 had | |5 been | |4 ripped | off |6 a | |0 few | |2 times | .
|3 I | |5 had | |4 hear | |0 great | |2 things | about |7 Phet | and |7 G&G | |7 Automotive | |1 so | |3 I | |4 decided | to |4 give | |3 him | |6 a | |2 try | .
|6 The | |2 service | |5 was | |0 excellent | and |0 personable | .
|3 He | |4 checked | out |3 what | |3 I | |4 needed | to |4 have | |4 done | |4 told | |3 me | |3 what | |4 needed | |5 be | |4 fixed | before |3 he | |4 did | |6 any | |2 work | and |4 did | |0 great | |2 repair | |2 work | .
"|6 The | |2 price | |5 was | |1 actually | |0 lower | than |3 what | |3 I | |5 had | |4 anticipated | and |4 used | to |4 compared | to |0 other | |2 places | , plus |3 he | |4 showed | |3 me | |6 the | |2 work | |3 he | |4 did | |1 when | |3 I | |4 came | |1 in | to |4 pick | up |6 the | |2 car | ."
"|1 Also | , |6 a | |2 week | after |6 the | |2 work | , |7 Phet | |4 called | |3 me | up to |4 see | |1 how | |3 my | |2 car | |5 was | |4 running | and to |4 let | |3 me | |4 know | that |3 they | |5 had | |1 accidentally | |4 overcharged | |3 me | for |2 part | of |6 the | |2 work | and |4 wanted | to |4 give | |3 me | |6 a | |2 refund | for |6 that | |2 amount | ."
|3 That | |5 is | |1 just | |0 unheard | |1 of | |6 these | |2 days | !
"|3 I | |4 grew | up in |6 a | |0 small | |2 town | |1 where | |3 you | |4 knew | and |4 trusted | |3 your | |2 mechanic | and |5 was | |1 really | |0 cynical | about |2 city | |2 auto | |2 repair | |2 shops | since |3 I | |4 moved | |1 here | , but |7 Phet | |5 has | |4 shown | that |3 there | |1 really | |4 are | |0 honest | |1 hard | |4 working | |2 mechanics | |1 around | ."
|3 He | |5 is | |3 my | |2 mechanic | |4 going | |1 forward | !
"|3 Our | |2 company | |5 is | |6 a | |0 high | |2 end | |2 designer | |2 handbag | and |2 fashion | |2 accessories | |2 company | , |1 thus | |3 we | |5 are | |1 certainly | |6 a | |2 niche | |2 market | ."
"|3 We | |5 had | |5 been | |4 evaluating | |2 SEO | |2 providers | for |6 quite | |6 some | |2 time | and |1 finally | |4 decided | to |4 take | |6 the | |2 plunge | with |7 Stuart | , and |7 Ulistic | ."
|3 We | |4 made | |6 the | |2 decision | for |6 a | |2 couple | of |2 reasons | .
1 . |0 Social | |2 Media | .
"|3 We | |5 were | |0 familiar | with |2 Search | |2 Engine | |2 Optimization | |2 strategies | , but |4 new | |3 nothing | about |0 Social | |2 Media | - |3 we | |1 just | |4 heard | that |3 it | |5 was | |6 the | |0 next | |0 big | |2 thing | ."
2 . |3 We | |1 really | |4 liked | |6 the | |2 fact | that |7 Stuart | |4 sets | |4 defined | |2 objectives | and |3 we | |4 meet | |1 once | |6 a | |2 month | to |4 go | over |3 our | |0 Key | |2 Performance | |2 Indicators | .
|1 How | |5 has | |3 it | |4 gone | |1 so | |1 far | ?
"Well |3 we | |5 have | |5 been | |4 working | with |7 Ulistic | for 1.5 |2 months | , and |4 have | 100 |2 people | |4 following | |3 our | |2 site | on |7 Facebook | , and |3 our | |2 web | |2 site | , www.designofashion.com |5 has | |4 seen | |6 a | 3 |2 fold | |2 increase | in |2 traffic | , |3 which | |5 is | |1 significantly | |4 beating | |3 our | |2 expectations | - |2 SEO | |5 is | |6 a | |2 process | |3 that | |4 takes | |2 time | and to |4 get | |2 results | |1 this | |1 quickly | |5 is | |0 exceptional | ."
"|3 We | |5 are | |1 absolutely | |0 confident | that |7 Stuart | 's |0 ethical | and |4 focused | |2 strategies | |5 will | |4 see | |6 these | |2 trends | |4 continue | to |4 grow | , and |3 our | |2 business | |5 will | |4 reap | |6 the | |2 rewards | of |6 this | |2 program | ."

"|6 The | |2 staff | |5 was | |0 friendly | , |1 especially | |6 the | |0 front | |2 desk | |0 female | |2 supervisor | , and |4 seemed | to |4 want | to |4 help | , but |1 too | |0 many | |0 unusual | |2 things | |4 happened | to |4 make | |3 us | |4 want | to |4 stay | |1 there | |1 again | ."
|5 Be | |0 Careful | Of |3 Who | |3 Your | |2 Sales | |2 Guy | |5 Is |
|3 I | |4 think | |6 this | |2 place | |5 is | |1 probably | |1 really | |0 great | |1 especially | |4 judging | by |6 the | |2 reviews | on |1 here | .
|3 My | |2 experience | |5 was | |0 awful | |1 though | .
|3 It | |6 ALL | |4 had | to |4 do | with |6 the | |2 sales | |2 guy | |3 which | |5 was | |6 a | |0 young | 22 |2 year | |0 old | |3 who | |5 had | |1 admittedly | |1 only | |5 been | |4 working | for 2 |2 weeks | .

"|1 Essentially | , |3 I | |4 told | |3 him | |3 I | |5 did | n't |4 trust | |3 him | cause |3 he | |5 was | |6 a | |2 car | |2 salesman | , but |3 he | |4 got | |1 so | |1 incredibly | |0 offended | at |6 that | |2 statement | that |3 he | |4 had | to |4 go | |4 cry | to |6 another | |2 salesman | and |4 compose | |3 himself | before |4 coming | |1 back | ."

"After |3 that | , |3 I | |1 just | |4 tried | to |4 ignore | |3 his | |2 lack | of |2 professionalism | and |2 test | |4 drive | |6 the | |2 car | ."

|3 This | |5 is | by |1 far | |6 the | |0 worst | |0 chinese | |2 food | |3 I | |5 have | |1 ever | |4 had | .
|6 The | |2 service | |4 stunk | .
"|3 I | |4 called | in |3 my | |2 order | and upon |4 arriving | to |4 pick | |3 it | up , |3 they | |4 got | |3 my | |2 order | |4 confused | with |3 someone | |0 else | s ."
|3 They | |4 helped | |1 about | three |0 other | |2 people | before |3 they | |4 offered | to |4 help | |3 me | |1 again | .
|3 They | |1 also | |4 got | |3 my | |2 friend | s |2 order | |4 mixed | up and |4 wanted | to |4 charger | |3 her | $ 10 |0 more | than |3 what | |3 she | |5 had | |4 wanted | .
|3 She | |4 asked | for |6 the | |2 dinner | |2 combo | and |3 they | |4 gave | |3 her | two |2 dinner | |2 plates | |1 instead | .
|3 We | |5 were | |4 standing | in |6 the | |2 store | for 20 |2 minutes | to |1 simply | |4 pick | up |6 an | |2 order | .
|1 Not | to |4 mention | that |6 the | |2 wait | |2 staff | |5 was | |1 about | |1 as | |0 pleasant | as |4 dealing | with |6 an | |0 angry | |2 bull | .
|3 They | |5 were | |0 abrasive | and |0 rude | - |1 when | |3 they | |5 were | |6 the | |2 ones | |3 who | |4 messed | |3 everything | up .
|3 We | |4 had | to |4 throw | out |1 about | 80 |2 percent | of |3 our | |2 meals | because |6 the | |2 food | |4 tasted | |1 so | |0 horrible | .
"|3 I | |5 do | nt |4 know | |1 how | |3 it | |5 is | |0 possible | to |4 make | |2 orange | |2 chicken | , |2 sesame | |2 chicken | and |2 kung | |2 pao | |2 chicken | |1 as | |1 well | as |2 cheese | |2 puffs | |4 taste | |1 THAT | |0 bad | but |7 China | |7 Delight | |4 accomplished | |3 that | ."
|6 The | |0 only | |2 thing | |3 that | |5 was | |0 edible | |5 was | |6 the | |4 steamed | |2 rice | and |6 the | |2 vegetable | |2 lo | |2 mein | |5 was | |1 barely | |0 tolerable | .

|7 Lucky | |7 Panda | in |7 Willis | |5 is | |6 a | billion |2 times | |0 better | in |2 service | and |2 quality | of |6 the | |2 meal | .
|3 I | |4 have | |6 no | |2 idea | |1 how | |7 China | |7 Delight | |4 won | |2 number | 1 |0 Chinese | |2 restaurant | in |7 Montgomery | - |3 There | |4 needs | to |5 be | |6 a | |2 recount | on |6 that | |2 vote | .
|0 Terrible | |2 Service |
One of |6 the | |0 worst | |2 experiences | |3 I | |5 've | |1 ever | |4 had | with |6 a | |2 auto | |2 repair | |2 shop | .
|3 We | |4 took | |3 our | |2 vehicle | |1 in | for |6 a | |2 repair | to |6 the | |2 air | |2 conditioning | .
"|1 Approx | 4 |2 months | |1 later | , |6 the | |2 compressor | |4 went | out ."
"|3 We | |4 took | |3 it | |1 back | |1 in | to |4 have | |3 it | |4 repaired | |1 again | , and |0 less | than |6 a | |2 week | |1 later | |6 the | |0 second | |2 compressor | |4 went | out ."
"|3 We | |4 went | |1 in | for |6 a | |0 third | |2 visit | and |3 they | |4 fixed | |3 it | |1 again | , but |6 this | |2 time | |1 when | |3 we | |4 picked | up |6 the | |2 car | , |6 the | |2 radio | and |2 clock | |5 did | not |4 work | ."
"|1 So | for |6 the | |0 4th | |2 time | in 5 |2 months | and |6 the | |0 third | |2 time | in 2 |2 weeks | , |3 we | |4 brought | |6 the | |2 car | |1 back | |1 again | ."
"|1 When | |3 we | |4 expressed | |3 our | |2 discontent | to |6 the | |2 manager | ( |3 that | |5 's | |0 right | , |6 the | |2 manager | ) , |5 did | |3 he | |4 say | |3 he | |5 would | |4 return | |6 some | |2 money | , |5 did | |3 he | |4 say | |3 he | |5 would | |4 give | |6 a | |2 discount | on |3 our | |0 next | |2 visit | , |5 did | |3 he | |1 just | |4 say | "" |3 I | |5 'm | |0 sorry | "" ."
"Nope , |2 none | of |6 the | |0 above | ."
|3 He | |4 stood | |1 there | and |4 told | |3 us | |1 how | |3 he | |5 was | n't at |2 fault | .
"|3 It | |5 was | |6 the | |2 fault | of |6 the | |2 parts | |2 supplier | , and |5 can | |3 we | |4 imagine | |1 how | |3 he | |4 felt | |4 having | to |4 put | |6 another | 2 |2 hours | of |2 work | in |6 the | |2 car | ."
And |3 what | |5 did | |3 we | |4 expect | ... that |3 he | |2 bench | |4 test | |6 every | |2 part | .
"At |6 no | |2 time | during |6 the | |2 conversation | |5 did | |6 the | |2 words | , "" |3 I | |5 'm | |0 sorry | "" |1 ever | |4 come | out of |3 his | |2 mouth | ."
"|3 I | , nor |3 anyone | |0 else | in |3 my | |2 family | , |5 will | |1 ever | |4 go | to |7 Sun | |7 Devil | |7 Auto | |1 again | ."
"Well , unless |1 of | |1 course | |6 the | |0 third | |2 compressor | |3 he | |4 put | in |6 the | |2 car | |4 goes | out ."
|5 Do | not |4 use | |6 this | |2 company | !
|3 I | |4 dropped | off |6 a | |2 sheet | |2 metal | |2 piece | |3 that | |3 I | |4 needed | |4 copied | due to th |3 it | |5 was | |4 needing | to |5 be | |4 replaced | .
|3 I | |4 asked | if |3 they | |5 could | |4 copy | |6 the | |2 piece | |3 I | |4 dropped | off .
|3 They | |4 said | |3 it | |5 would | |5 be | |4 made | |1 exactly | like |6 the | one |3 I | |4 needed | to |4 replace | .
|3 I | |4 picked | |3 it | up |1 when | |3 it | |5 was | |0 finished | and |5 was | |4 charge | 30.00 .
|1 When | |3 I | |4 got | to |6 the | |2 job | and |4 tried | to |4 insert | |6 the | |0 new | |2 piece | of |0 metal | |3 IT | |5 WOULD | NOT |4 FIT | !!
|3 I | |4 took | |6 the | |0 original | |2 piece | of |2 metal | and |4 rigged | |3 it | to |4 make | |4 due | since |3 I | |4 had | to |4 complete | |6 the | |2 job | .
|3 I | |4 took | |6 the | |2 receipt | and |6 the | |2 metal | |3 that | |5 did | not |4 fit | and |4 asked | |7 Pomper | for |3 my | |2 money | |1 back | .
|6 The | |2 girl | at |6 the | |2 desk | |5 was | |1 sooo | |0 rude | |3 I | |5 could | not |4 believe | |3 it | !
|3 She | |4 told | |3 me | |3 she | |5 could | not |4 use | |6 the | |2 piece | |3 I | |5 was | |4 returning | and |6 the | |2 company | |5 would | |1 only | |4 put | |3 it | in |6 the | |2 trash | |1 so | |3 I | |5 could | not |4 return | |3 it | .
|3 I | |4 explained | |3 I | |5 did | not |4 get | |3 what | |3 I | |4 paid | for .
|3 She | |4 asked | |3 me | to |4 bring | |6 the | |0 original | |2 piece | |1 back | and |3 I | |4 told | |3 her | |3 I | |4 had | to |4 use | |3 it | on |6 the | |2 job | .
|3 She | |4 told | |3 me | |3 that | |5 was | |1 to | |0 bad | |3 she | |5 would | |4 do | |3 nothing | to |4 help | |3 me | since |3 she | |5 could | not |4 use | or |4 resell | |6 the | |2 piece | .
|3 I | |4 said | |3 I | |5 was | |4 going | to |4 trash | |3 it | |1 also | and |5 could | |3 I | |1 at | |1 least | |4 have | |6 a | |2 credit | .
With |6 a | |2 smirk | on |3 her | |2 face | |3 she | |4 told | |3 me | |6 NO | |2 MONEY | |5 IS | |5 BEING | |4 RETURNED | and |3 THAT | |5 IS | |6 THE | |2 WAY | |3 IT | |4 WAS | .
|5 DO | NOT |4 USE | |6 THIS | |2 COMPANY | .
|3 There | |4 are | |1 to | |0 many | |2 people | |3 that | |4 need | |3 our | |2 business | to |4 have | to |4 put | up with |6 this | |0 unfair | |2 treatment | !!!!!
|3 I | |5 would | |1 NEVER | |4 recommend | |6 this | |2 gym | to |3 anyone | and |1 unfortunately | |3 this | |5 is | |4 based | |1 solely | on |6 the | |2 owner | 's |0 own | |2 unprofessionalism | .
|1 When | |3 I | |1 originally | |4 joined | in |7 January | |3 I | |1 only | |5 did | |1 so | because |3 I | |5 was | |4 told | |3 I | |5 would | |5 be | |0 able | to |4 cancel | |6 the | 12 |2 month | |2 membership | if |3 I | |5 was | to |4 move | |1 away | .
|3 I | |4 signed | up with one of |6 the | |2 staff | |3 who | |5 was | |1 very | |0 pleasant | and |0 professional | .
|1 Actually | |4 working | out |1 there | |5 was | |0 good | - |6 the | |2 machines | |5 are | |0 nice | and |6 the | |2 classes | |5 are | |0 fun | .
|6 The | |2 locker | |2 room | |5 is | |1 certainly | |4 lacking | - |3 I | |5 would | |1 never | |4 shower | or |4 change | |1 there | .
|3 They | |4 need | to |4 update | |6 the | |2 locker | |2 rooms | |1 ASAP | .
|1 Back | to |3 my | |0 poor | |2 rating | - |3 I | |5 was | |4 excepted | to |0 medical | |2 school | and |4 went | |1 in | to |4 cancel | |3 my | |2 membership | as |3 I | |5 was | |4 told | |3 I | |5 could | |4 do | since |3 I | |5 was | |4 moving | |1 away | .
"|6 The | |2 owner | |5 was | |1 VERY | |0 rude | , |4 accused | |3 me | of |1 not | |4 reading | |3 my | |2 contract | , and |1 basically | |4 told | |3 me | to |4 shut | up |1 when | |3 I | |5 was | |4 trying | to |4 ask | |2 questions | to |1 further | |4 understand | |6 the | |2 process | of |4 canceling | |3 my | |2 membership | ."
|3 I | |5 was | |0 able | to |4 cancel | |3 it | but |1 only | after |4 paying | |6 a | $ 50 |2 fee | ( |3 which | |6 the | |2 staff | |2 person | |3 who | |4 signed | |3 me | up |4 stated | |3 I | |5 would | not |4 have | to |4 pay | if |3 I | |4 had | |2 proof | of |2 moving | ) and |5 being | |4 spoken | to in |6 a | |1 very | |0 belittling | |2 manner | .
|3 I | |5 would | |4 understand | if |3 I | |5 was | |5 being | |4 treated | |6 this | |2 way | by |6 a | |2 staff | |2 member | but |6 the | |2 club | 's |0 actual | |2 OWNER | ?!
|0 Bad | for |2 business | .
|3 I | |5 was | |0 appalled | .
|3 I | |5 will | |1 never | |4 recommend | |6 this | |2 gym | to |6 any | |2 woman | .
|6 The | |2 equipment | and |2 classes | |5 are | n't |0 good | |0 enough | to |4 deal | with |6 the | |2 rudeness | from |6 the | |2 staff | !!!
|3 There | |4 are | |0 better | |2 places | on |6 the | |2 Cape | - |7 FITNESS | |7 500 | !
|6 The | |2 Salon | |2 Experience | from |7 Hell |
|3 I | |4 feel | |0 obligated | to |4 share | |6 this | |2 story | .
|1 Right | out of |2 college | |3 I | |4 called | |6 the | |2 salon | and |4 explained | |3 my | |2 situation | .
"|1 Just | |4 graduated | , |1 just | |4 moved | , not |0 rich | , and |4 starting | |0 new | |2 job | |1 soon | ."
"|3 I | |1 never | |4 got | |6 a | |2 price | |2 quote | over |6 the | |2 phone | and |3 they | |4 take | |3 your | |2 cc | |2 info | |1 just | to |4 make | |6 the | |2 appointment | because if |3 you | |5 do | n't |4 show | up , |3 they | |5 'll | |4 charge | |3 you | ."
|3 I | |4 had | |6 this | |0 ridiculous | |2 celebrity | |2 stylist | from |7 LA | |4 named | |7 Derrick | .
"After |3 he | |1 already | |4 put | |2 product | on |3 my | |2 hair | |3 he | |4 said | "" |3 I | |5 should | |4 warn | |3 you | , |3 I | |5 'm | |0 expensive | . """
"|3 What | |5 was | |3 I | |4 supposed | to |4 do | , |4 say | |3 I | |5 ca | n't |4 afford | |3 you | and |4 walk | |1 out | with |2 crap | |1 all | over |3 my | |2 hair | ."
|3 I | |4 wanted | to |5 be | |1 very | |0 blonde | and |1 instead | |3 he | |4 pulled | |3 my | |2 root | |2 color | throughout |3 my | |0 whole | |2 hair | |3 which | |5 is | |6 a | |0 gross | |2 mousey | |2 brown | .
"|6 The | |0 other | |2 stylists | around |3 me | |4 kept | |4 pressuring | |3 me | |4 saying | |3 he | |5 's | |1 so | |0 wonderful | , |3 you | |5 're | |4 going | to |4 love | |3 your | |2 hair | ."
$ 400 |1 later | |3 my | |2 jaw | |4 dropped | |1 when | |6 the | |2 receptionist | |4 told | |3 me | |6 the | |2 total | .
"|7 Derrick | |4 did | |6 a | |0 terrible | |2 job | , |5 was | |6 a | |0 complete | |2 jerk | |6 the | |0 entire | |2 time | , and |3 I | |4 had | |6 no | |2 warning | as to |6 the | |2 price | ."
|3 I | |4 cried | |6 the | |0 entire | |2 way | |1 home | .
"|3 He | |1 then | "" |4 fixed | "" |3 it | for |0 free | but |3 it | |1 still | |4 looked | like |2 crap | ."
|3 I | |5 will | |1 never | |4 go | |1 back | .
|3 It | |5 was | |6 the | |2 salon | |2 experience | from |1 absolutely | |7 Hell | .
|3 He | |1 also | |4 told | |3 me | that |3 he | |4 worked | on |6 the | |2 cast | of |7 will | and |7 grace | and that |3 they | |5 were | |1 all | |2 jerks | .
|3 That | |5 's | |3 my | |0 favorite | |2 show | of |6 all | |2 time | .
|3 I | |5 'm | |1 pretty | |0 sure | for |6 the | |2 cast | that |3 it | |5 was | |6 the | |0 other | |2 way | |1 around | .
|1 Maybe | |3 he | |5 did | n't |4 do | |6 a | |0 good | |2 job | and |3 they | |4 told | |3 him | |1 so | .
|0 Absolute | |2 Nightmare | !
|4 STAY | |1 AWAY | !
|1 Very | |0 unhappy | ...
"|4 Working | with |7 Rod | |7 Jacobsen | |5 was | |3 my | |0 first | |2 experience | |4 working | with |6 a | |2 CPA | , |1 so | |3 I | |5 did | not |4 know | |3 what | to |4 expect | ."
|3 That | |4 said | - |3 he | |4 seemed | to |5 be | |4 doing | |1 well | |1 enough | .
"|1 However | , |1 then | |3 I | |4 asked | to |4 amend | |3 my | |2 return | to |4 apply | |6 a | |2 credit | |3 I | |5 had | |1 just | |4 become | |0 eligible | for ."
"|3 I | |4 expected | to |4 pay | for |6 this | |2 service | , but |4 imagine | |3 my | |2 surprise | |1 when | |3 I | |4 received | |6 a | |2 bill | for |0 MORE | than |3 what | |3 I | |4 paid | to |4 have | |6 the | |0 original | |2 return | |4 prepared | ."
"|4 Asked | |1 why | , |7 Rod | |1 simply | |4 told | |3 me | that |3 he | |4 had | to |4 research | |1 how | to |4 do | |6 the | |2 amendment | ( |3 it | |5 was | |6 an | |2 amended | to |4 show | that |3 I | |5 had | |4 purchased | |6 a | |2 home | - |3 nothing | out of |6 the | |0 ordinary | , |3 one | |5 would | |4 think | ) and |3 that | |4 took | |2 time | to |4 figure | out ."
"Well , |3 that | |5 was | |2 strike | one ."
"|3 I | |5 was | n't |4 going | to |4 use | |3 them | |1 again | , but |3 I | |5 was | |4 going | to |4 leave | |3 it | at |3 that | ."
"|1 However | , |1 now | that |3 I | |5 have | |4 come | to |4 realize | that |3 I | |5 am | |4 going | to |4 owe | |6 the | |7 IRS | $ 6,000 + despite |4 doing | |1 exactly | |3 what | |7 Rod | |4 told | |3 me | to |4 do | , |3 I | |4 feel | |3 I | |4 have | to |4 voice | |3 my | |2 opinion | ."
"|0 Last | |2 year | , after |6 all | |5 was | |4 said | and |4 done | , |3 I | |4 asked | |7 Rod | whether |3 my | |2 payment | |2 structure | |5 would | |4 leave | |3 me | with |6 no | / |0 little | |2 tax | |2 liability | at |6 the | |2 end | of |6 the | |2 year | ."
|3 He | |4 said | yes .
"Well , |1 again | , |3 I | |5 am | |1 now | |4 faced | with |6 a | |2 tax | |2 bill | of $ 6,000 + , |6 all | |0 due | on |7 April | 15 , 2010 and |6 all | |3 that | |7 Rod | |4 has | to |4 say | to |6 the | |2 matter | |4 is | ' well , |3 you | |5 wo | n't |4 have | to |4 pay | |6 a | |2 penalty | .

"|3 I | |5 may | not |4 have | to |4 pay | |6 a | |2 penalty | , |1 yet | , but |3 this | |5 is | NOT |3 what | |3 I | |4 had | in |2 mind | |1 when | |4 hired | |6 these | |2 guys | ."
"In |6 the | |2 words | of |3 my | |0 new | |2 accountant | , |3 THEY | |4 LET | |3 ME | DOWN !"
"|2 Bit | |0 sketchy | , |0 sporadic | |2 delivery | |2 times |"
|3 I | |4 bought | |1 about | |2 half | of |6 the | |2 furniture | |3 I | |4 own | from |6 this | |2 place | .
|1 Why | ?
Because |3 they | |4 cut | |3 me | |0 good | |2 deals | if |3 I | |4 paid | in |2 cash | .
"|0 Sketchy | , |0 right | ?"
Well |3 they | |4 came | |1 through | and |4 delivered | |1 almost | |6 all | of |3 my | |2 items | within |6 a | |0 few | |2 days | .
( |3 They | |1 even | |4 got | |3 me | |6 a | |2 couch | |1 pretty | |1 quickly | . )
"|6 The | |2 guy | |3 who | |5 was | |4 cutting | |3 me | |6 the | |2 deals | and |4 getting | |3 me | |6 the | |2 furniture | |1 quickly | , |7 Ahmed | , |5 was | |0 nice | and |1 mostly | |0 professional | , except |6 the | |2 semi-sketchiness | ."
"|1 Then | one |2 day | , |7 Ahmed | |4 left | |6 the | |2 country | , |1 not | to |4 return | for |2 months | , WITHOUT |4 informing | |3 me | ."
|3 He | |1 also | |4 neglected | to |4 tell | |6 the | |0 other | |2 person | |4 working | at |6 the | |2 store | about |6 a | |2 dining | |2 room | |2 table | |3 that | |3 I | |5 had | |4 ordered | and |3 that | |5 was | |4 supposed | to |5 be | |4 coming | |1 in | .
|6 The | |0 other | |2 person | |4 working | at |6 the | |2 store | |5 did | n't |4 know | that |3 I | |1 still | |4 had | |6 this | |2 table | |4 coming | .
"|3 I | |5 had | |4 paid | in |2 cash | , and |3 he | |4 said | |3 he | |4 had | |6 no | |2 receipt | / |2 record | of |3 my | |2 purchase | ."
"|3 I | |4 came | |1 back | with |6 the | |2 receipt | |7 Ahmed | |5 had | |4 provided | upon |3 my | |2 purchase | , and |6 the | |2 guy | |4 took | |1 forever | to |4 copy | |3 it | but |4 said | that |3 he | |5 would | |4 take | |2 care | of |6 the | |2 situation | ."
|3 I | |4 waited | .
And |4 waited | .
|3 He | |1 never | |1 once | |4 contacted | |3 us | .
|3 I | |5 've | |4 had | to |4 pester | |6 this | |0 new | |2 guy | |0 several | |2 times | to |4 ask | |1 when | |3 my | |2 table | |5 will | |4 arrive | .

"On |7 August | |2 21st | , 2009 |3 I | |4 ordered | |2 furniture | from |7 Hickory | |7 Furniture | |7 Mart | and |4 contracted | for |7 HDS | to |4 deliver | |3 it | ."
After seventeen |2 days | |6 the | |2 delivery | |2 van | |4 showed | up at |3 my | |2 home | minus two |2 pieces | .
|3 I | |5 was | |1 later | |4 told | |3 they | |5 had | |5 been | |4 left | at |6 the | |2 warehouse | and |6 some | |2 future | |2 date | |3 they | |5 would | |5 be | |4 delivered | .
|6 No | one |5 will | |4 give | |3 me | |6 a | |2 date | .
"|3 I | |4 spent | $ 2300 on |6 the | |2 bedroom | |2 suite | , |3 which | |5 was | |0 complete | and |0 excellent | |2 condition | on |6 the | |2 showroom | |2 floor | ."
Upon |2 delivery | |3 it | |5 was | |0 clear | |6 the | |0 entire | |2 set | |5 was | |4 damaged | : |6 a | |2 piece | of |2 wood | |5 was | |0 broke | on |6 the | |2 headboard | ; |6 the | |2 chest | of |2 drawers | |5 was | |4 missing | |6 all | four |2 pieces | |0 necessary | to |4 attach | |6 the | |2 legs | ; |6 the | |2 dresser | |0 back | |2 legs | |5 were | |4 pushed | in |4 causing | |6 the | |2 dresser | to |4 lean | into |6 the | |2 wall | ; and |6 a | |2 nighstand | |5 was | |4 missing | |6 a | |2 drawer | .

|0 Excellent | |2 Driving | |2 School |

|3 I | |4 had | to |4 cancel | |3 my | |0 initial | |2 lesson | 4 |2 times | and on |6 the | |0 5th | |2 attempt | |6 the | |2 management | |5 was | |0 quick | |1 enough | to |4 associate | |3 my | |2 cancellations | with |3 my | |2 fear | and |1 finally | |4 encouraged | |3 me | into |4 taking | |3 my | |0 initial | |2 lesson | .

|2 Review | on |2 House | of |7 Joy | |7 Chinese | |7 Restaurant |
|3 My | |2 family | and |3 I | |4 moved | to |7 San | |7 Antonio | |6 a | |2 year | |1 ago | and |5 have | |4 tried | |1 almost | |6 all | of |6 the | |0 Chinese | |2 Restaurants | because |3 we | |4 love | |0 Chinese | |2 food | .
Well |3 it | |4 took | |3 us | |6 a | |2 while | to |4 find | one |3 that | |3 we | |4 liked | .
But |3 we | |5 do | n't |1 just | |4 like | |2 House | of |7 Joy | |3 WE | |4 LOVE | |3 IT | .
|3 Everything | |3 we | |5 have | |4 gotten | |1 there | |5 has | |5 been | |1 more | |0 authentic | and |1 better | |4 tasting | than |6 any | |0 other | |0 Chinese | |2 restaurant | in |6 the | |7 San | |7 Antonio | |2 area | |3 we | |5 have | |5 been | to -- and |4 trust | |3 me | |3 we | |5 have | |5 been | to |6 a | |2 lot | of |3 them | .
|3 We | |1 just | |4 happen | to |4 stumble | across |6 this | |0 little | |2 restaurant | one |2 day | |1 when | |3 we | |4 had | to |4 visit | |6 the | |7 Bexar | |7 County | |7 Tax | |7 Office | off of |7 Bandera | |7 Road | .
|3 We | |4 stopped | |1 in | and |4 got | |6 some | |2 take | |2 out | and |5 can | not |4 stop | |4 going | |1 back | .
|3 They | |4 have | |6 the | |0 best | |7 Egg | |7 Drop | |7 Soup | |3 I | |5 have | |1 ever | |4 tasted | .
|3 We | |1 also | |4 love | |3 their | |2 Egg | |2 Rolls | and |2 Spring | |2 Rolls | .
And |6 every | |2 entree | |3 we | |5 have | |4 ordered | |5 is | |0 perfect | .
|3 Everything | |5 is | |1 always | |4 cooked | |1 fresh | and |4 tastes | |0 fresh | .
|3 Their | |2 prices | |5 are | |1 extremely | |0 reasonable | for |6 the | |2 amount | of |2 food | |3 you | |4 receive | .
|6 The | |2 staff | |5 is | |1 also | |1 just | |1 so | |0 pleasant | to |4 deal | with .
|3 They | |5 are | |1 also | |0 quick | at |4 getting | |3 your | |2 order | |1 out | to |3 you | .
|3 You | |5 do | n't |4 have | to |4 sit | and |4 wait | |1 around | |1 forever | like |0 most | |2 places | !!
|1 So | |3 anyone | |4 looking | for |6 an | |0 Excellent | |2 night | |1 out | for |0 Chinese | or |1 maybe | |1 just | |2 lunch | |5 should | |4 stop | |1 in | and |4 try | |3 it | because |3 I | |4 promise | |3 you | 2 |2 things | --- |3 You | |5 wo | n't |4 regret | |3 it | !!
and |3 you | |5 will | |4 go | |1 back | for |0 more | !!!

|3 We | |5 are | from |7 Virginia | and |1 just | |4 moved | |1 here | |6 a | |2 year | |1 ago | .
|1 So | |6 that | |2 comment | |5 is | |1 completely | |0 false | .
Because |3 we | |4 think | |3 IT | |5 'S | |6 THE | |0 BEST | !!!
and |3 we | |5 do | n't |4 know | |3 them | except for |4 eating | |1 there | .
|7 Dr. | |7 Strzalka | at |7 Flagship | |7 CVTS | |5 is | not |6 a | |0 good | |2 doctor |
"|3 I | |5 am | not |0 sure | about |6 the | |2 quality | of |6 the | |0 other | |2 doctors | |1 there | , but |3 i | |5 do | |4 know | from |0 personal | |2 experience | that |7 Dr. | |7 Christopher | |7 T. | |7 Strzalka | |5 is | not |6 a | |2 man | of |3 his | |2 word | , and |5 is | |1 also | |1 very | |0 CRUEL | AND |0 UNCARING | !!"
|3 He | |5 was | |4 going | to |4 operate | and |4 replace | |3 my | |0 bicuspid | |0 aortic | |2 valve | due to |0 critical | |0 aortic | |2 stenosis | .
"|3 I | |4 had | |6 a | |2 surgery | |2 date | of |7 July | 17 , 2008 ."
"|1 Then | |3 he | |4 renigged | |1 when | |3 he | |4 read | |3 my | |7 Health | |7 Care | |7 Proxy | , |1 even | though |3 i | |4 agreed | to |5 be | on |6 the | |2 ventilator | for 2 |2 months | |4 following | |2 surgery | ( as |3 he | |5 had | |1 twice | |4 stated | |3 i | |5 must | |4 agree | to ) ."
"|3 He | |1 later | |4 said | that by 2 |2 months | |3 he | "" |4 meant | |1 at | |1 least | two |2 months | "" ."
Two |2 months | and |1 at | |1 least | two |2 months | |5 are | |1 totally | |0 different | |2 things | .
"|3 He | |5 did | not |1 even | |4 give | |3 me | |6 the | |2 chance | to |4 say | |3 i | |5 would | |4 stay | on |6 the | |2 ventilator | |1 longer | , |3 which | |3 i | |5 would | |5 have | ."
|6 A | |7 Health | |7 Care | |7 Proxy | |5 is | not |4 written | in |2 stone | and |5 can | |5 be | |4 changed | .
|3 He | |1 also | |1 never | |1 even | |4 said | |3 he | |5 was | |0 sorry | .
|1 Just | |4 said | |3 i | |5 was | |0 inoperable | and |4 walked | out of |6 the | |2 hospital | |2 room | .
"|1 So | , |1 therefore | , |1 now | |3 he | |4 says | |3 i | |5 am | |0 inoperable | ( |1 even | though |3 i | |5 am | not 100 % |0 inoperable | ) , and |3 he | |5 is | |4 letting | |3 me | |4 die | ."
"|3 I | |5 am | |1 just | |0 middle | |0 aged | and |5 do | not |4 want | to |4 die | , but |2 thanks | to |6 this | |2 doctor | |3 i | |4 have | |6 no | |0 other | |2 alternatives | ."
"|3 I | , along with |3 my | |2 friends | , |4 consider | |6 this | |2 doctor | to |5 be | |6 the | |2 cause | of |3 my | |2 death | as |3 he | |5 is | not |1 even | |4 trying | to |4 save | |3 my | |2 life | by |4 operating | ."
"|1 Even | |3 my | |7 PA | |3 i | |4 went | to |6 the | |0 other | |2 day | |4 said | "" |3 it | |5 must | |4 by | |0 comforting | to |5 have | |4 gone | to |6 a | |2 heart | |2 surgeon | like |3 him | |3 who | |5 will | |4 do | |3 nothing | for |3 you | "" ."
|3 He | |4 said | |3 it | |1 sarcastically | .
"If |3 you | |4 want | |6 a | |2 doctor | |3 who | |5 will | |4 lie | to |3 you | and |4 say | |3 he | |5 will | |4 operate | and |1 then | |4 change | |3 his | |2 mind | , and not |4 know | |3 what | |3 he | |5 is | |4 talking | about |1 when | |3 he | |4 recommends | |2 procedures | at |0 other | |2 hospitals | and |4 says | |3 they | |4 are | |3 what | |3 you | |4 need | , |1 when | |3 they | |5 will | not |4 work | for |3 you | , |4 go | to |6 this | |2 doctor | ... |3 he | |5 is | |6 the | |2 one | for |3 you | ."
|3 What | |3 you | |5 can | |4 learn | from |6 the | |0 below | ' |0 bad | |2 experience | ' .
|3 I | |5 would | |4 suggest | |1 not | |4 avoiding | |7 Second | |7 Home | |4 based | on |6 the | ' |0 bad | |2 experience | ' |2 review | .
"|3 I | |5 'd | |1 probably | |5 be | |1 more | |0 inclined | to |4 board | |3 my | two |2 dogs | |1 here | , |4 seeing | that |3 they | |5 do | n't |1 just | |4 take | |6 every | |2 dog | |4 coming | |1 in | ."
"|3 I | |5 've | |4 toured | |6 this | |2 place | and |5 was | |4 impressed | by |1 how | |0 clean | |6 the | |2 place | |5 was | , and |6 all | |6 the | |2 options | for |6 the | |2 dogs | ."
|3 It | |5 's | |0 unfortunate | that |7 bmil | |4 believed | that |3 his | ' |0 perfect | ' |2 dog | |5 was | not |4 given | |6 the | |0 right | |2 opportunity | to |4 prove | |3 himself | .
"But |3 I | |5 've | |4 done | |2 hundreds | of |2 dog | |2 introductions | |3 myself | ( |6 another | |2 place | , |3 I | |5 do | n't |4 work | |1 here | ) , and |2 owners | |5 can | |4 have | |0 unrealistic | |2 expectations | and |2 views | of |3 what | |3 they | |4 see | |1 when | |3 their | |2 dogs | |4 meet | |0 other | |2 dogs | ."
|2 Workers | |3 who | |4 do | |6 these | |2 introductions | |4 look | at |6 the | |2 interaction | |1 objectively | ; and |3 it | |5 's | |0 good | to |4 see | |3 they | |5 are | |0 able | and |0 willing | to |4 say | no if |3 they | |4 feel | |3 there | |5 would | |4 be | |6 a | |2 problem | .
"|3 It | |4 sounds | ( |4 according | to |3 your | |0 own | |2 statement | ) that |3 they | |4 had | |6 a | |2 roomful | of |2 dogs | , |1 so | |3 they | |5 must | |5 be | |4 doing | |3 something | |1 right | - and |5 are | |4 keeping | |6 those | |2 dogs | |0 safe | from |0 potential | |2 problems | ."
"|3 You | |4 say | |3 you | |4 work | |6 a | |2 lot | , and that |3 you | |4 have | |6 a | |0 young | |2 dog | ; |1 so | |3 I | |4 have | |0 little | |2 doubt | that |3 your | |2 dog | |5 is | |1 just | |4 filled | with |2 energy | to |4 burn | ; and |3 it | |5 is | |0 good | of |3 you | to |4 look | for |6 a | |2 place | to |4 take | |3 him | ."
But not at |6 a | |2 risk | to |0 other | |2 people | 's |2 pets | .
"|3 You | |5 were | |1 clearly | |4 given | |6 another | |2 alternative | by |7 Second | |7 Home | , to |4 board | |3 him | - |3 which | |5 might | |5 have | |4 given | |3 your | |2 dog | |6 a | |2 chance | to |4 come | and |4 go | from |7 Second | |7 Home | |6 a | |2 couple | |2 times | , |4 getting | |0 used | to |6 the | |2 place | and |1 maybe | |4 facilitating | |6 another | |2 attempt | to |4 get | into |2 daycare | |1 later | ."
|6 No | |2 business | |5 is | |4 going | to |4 push | |2 customers | |1 away | without |0 good | |2 reason | ; |1 so | |5 is | n't |3 it | |0 reasonable | to |4 think | |3 they | |5 might | |4 know | |3 what | |3 they | |5 're | |4 doing | ?
"|3 My | |2 dogs | |5 are | |1 far | from |0 perfect | , and one of |3 them | |3 I | |4 believe | |5 would | |5 be | |6 a | |0 little | |0 much | for |2 daycare | |1 here | |3 herself | ( |1 at | |1 least | |1 initially | ) ."
"|5 Be | |6 a | |0 little | |1 more | |0 reasonable | with |3 your | |2 expectations | of |6 a | |2 place | like |3 this | ; and |1 maybe | |5 do | n't |4 jump | to |0 personal | |2 attacks | |4 suggesting | that |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 want | to |4 work | |1 hard | , |1 just | because |3 you | |4 bruised | |3 your | |0 own | |2 ego | ."

YES !
|3 I | |5 WAS | |4 calling | about one |2 board | !!
|3 I | |5 'm | |1 very | |0 frustrated | at |6 this | |2 point | - |3 it | |5 would | |4 take | |6 all | of 10 |2 min | for |3 them | to |4 come | |1 by | and |4 replace | |6 the | one |2 board | |3 that | |5 is | |4 cracked | ( |6 the | |2 crack | |5 is | |0 deep | |1 enough | to |4 stick | |6 a | |2 penny | in |3 it | and |3 it | |4 goes | |1 clear | |1 through | ) yet |3 they | |5 do | not |4 want | to |4 take | |6 the | |2 time | to |4 bother | with |3 what | |1 once | |5 WAS | |6 a | |0 happy | |2 customer | and |5 has | |1 now | |4 become | |6 a | |0 dissatisfied | |2 customer | .

"|2 Lots | of |2 rules | , |2 phantom | |2 innkeeper | , |0 last | |2 minute | |2 price | |5 was | |0 worth | |3 it | ."
"|3 I | |4 called | |6 the | "" 207 "" |2 number | and |4 listened | to |6 the | |0 same | |2 recording | |2 loop | 3 |2 times | before |3 I | |4 gave | up ."
|3 I | |1 then | |4 called | |6 the | 800 |2 number | ( |3 which | |5 was | |4 answered | ) and |4 inquired | about |0 last | |2 minute | |2 rates | .
"|3 They | |4 had | |6 a | |2 room | with |6 a | $ 99 |2 rate | , |3 which | |3 I | |4 booked | ."
"|6 The | |2 room | |5 was | |4 supposed | to |5 be | on |6 the | |0 2nd | |2 floor | , but |3 they | |4 put | |3 us | on |6 the | |0 3rd | ."

|4 Quit | with |6 the | |2 overstatements | !
"|6 The | |0 worst | |2 thing | |3 that | |5 can | |4 happen | for |6 any | |2 restaurant | like |7 Zahav | |4 is | to |4 have | |1 too | |0 many | |2 people | |4 write | |0 hyperbolic | |2 reviews | |4 making | |2 claims | that "" |3 everyone | "" |5 is | |4 going | to "" |4 love | "" |6 the | |2 food | , |2 decor | and |2 service | ."

"|3 It | |5 's | |6 an | |1 entirely | |1 up | and |1 down | |2 experience | , |1 however | ."
"|1 Now | , |6 the | |0 best | of |6 that | |0 unique | |2 food | |4 comes | at |6 the | |0 very | |2 beginning | of |6 the | |2 meal | ."
|6 The | |2 salatim | |2 salads | |5 are | |6 the | |0 smallest | |2 plates | |3 I | |5 've | |1 ever | |4 seen | |4 placed | in |2 front | of |3 me | ( |3 you | |5 would | |1 most | |1 likely | |4 think | |3 they | |5 were | |2 condiments | if |3 it | |5 were | n't |4 explained | to |3 you | ) .

"|3 That | |5 being | |4 said | , |6 the | |2 laffa | and |2 hummus | |5 are | out of |6 this | |2 world | ."
"|1 Then | |1 again | , for |6 the | three of |3 us | |3 who | |4 dined | |1 together | , two |2 pieces | of |2 flatbread | |4 left | |3 us | |4 fighting | for |0 more | , and |4 licking | |6 the | |2 hummus | from |3 our | |2 fingers | ( and yes , |6 those | two |2 pieces | of |2 flatbread | |5 did | |4 represent | |6 a | three - |2 person | |2 order | ) ."
|2 Dinner | |5 was | |1 also | |6 an | |0 up | - and - |0 down | |2 experience | .

"|2 Dessert | |4 was | ... hmmm , |3 that | |5 's | |0 interesting | , |3 I | |5 do | n't |1 even | |4 remember | |2 dessert | ."
|3 I | |4 guess | |3 that | |4 tells | |3 you | |6 a | |2 lot | .

"|2 Service | |5 was | |0 average | , but |3 nothing | |0 special | , and |2 restaurants | |3 that | |5 are | |4 supposed | to |5 be | |0 excellent | |5 should | |4 do | |6 a | |0 better | |2 job | of |4 training | |3 their | |2 waitstaff | to |5 be | |0 communicative | and |0 friendly | , |1 not | |1 merely | |0 capable | ."

At |3 my | |2 appointment | |6 the | |2 girl | |4 helping | |3 me | |5 was | |0 unable | to |1 adequately | |4 lace | up |6 some | of |6 the | |2 dresses | .
|3 They | |4 felt | like |3 they | |5 were | |4 going | to |4 fall | |1 off | of |3 me | and |3 it | |5 was | |1 very | |0 difficult | to |4 see | |3 what | |3 I | |5 would | |1 actually | |4 look | like |4 were | |3 I | to |4 purchase | |6 some | of |6 these | |2 dresses | .

"|3 They | either : a ) |5 do | n't |4 want | to |4 give | |3 it | to |3 me | because |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 want | |3 me | |4 purchasing | |6 the | |2 dress | |1 elsewhere | or b ) |5 are | |4 recreating | |6 the | |2 dresses | |3 themselves | ( ie |4 STEALING | |0 other | |2 designers | ' |2 dress | |2 designs | and "" |4 filling | |6 the | |2 orders | "" by |3 their | |0 own | |2 seamstresses | ) ."

|3 I | |4 brought | |3 my | |2 car | |1 in | on |6 a | |7 Sunday | to |4 replace | |6 a | |4 shredded | |2 tire | .
"|3 I | |4 waited | |1 about | 20 |2 minutes | in |6 the | |2 store | |2 part | before |3 anyone | |5 was | |0 able | to |4 assist | |3 me | and |5 was | |1 then | |4 told | to |4 pull | |3 my | |2 car | into |6 the | |2 shop | ( |3 that | |5 is | |1 apparently | |3 what | |3 you | |5 are | |4 supposed | to |4 do | , but |6 the | |0 big | |2 signs | |4 pointing | |3 you | |6 that | |2 way | |5 are | for |6 some | |2 reason | |4 kept | inside |6 the | |2 garage | , |1 so | |3 you | |5 do | n't |4 see | |3 them | |4 drving | |1 up | , and |3 they | |1 purposely | |4 block | |6 the | |2 front | |2 pull | - |2 up | |3 that | |6 all | |0 other | |7 Sear's | |4 use | ) ."

"|3 He | |4 said | |3 it | |5 was | |6 the | |0 same | |2 tire | , and |4 verified | |3 this | , after |4 checking | both |6 the | |0 actual | |2 tire | on |3 my | |2 car | and |3 my | |2 service | |2 papers | from |1 earlier | in |6 the | |2 week | ."

Ok -- fine .

"|3 They | |4 promised | |3 it | |5 'd | |5 be | |4 done | within |6 an | |2 hour | , |1 so | |3 I | |4 waited | in |6 the | |2 lobby | ."

|1 Of | |1 course | |3 I | |5 could | n't |4 make | |3 it | |1 back | in |2 time | ( and |3 they | |1 apparently | |5 could | not |4 stay | 5 |0 extra | |2 minutes | to |4 wait | for |3 me | ) .
"|6 The | |0 next | |2 day | , |6 no | |2 one | |5 could | |4 find | |3 my | |2 wheel | |2 lock | and |6 that | |0 particular | |2 technician | |5 was | not |1 in | ."
"|1 Of | |1 course | , |3 they | |5 could | n't |4 call | |3 him | |1 either | to |4 ask | about |3 it | because |1 apparently | |3 they | |5 do | n't |4 keep | |3 their | |2 employees | ' |2 phone | |2 numbers | ( riiight ) , |1 so | |3 I | |5 would | |4 have | to |4 return | on |7 Monday | ( |4 driving | for 3 |2 days | |1 now | with |6 no | |2 wheel | |2 lock | |5 should | |3 I | |4 get | |6 a | |2 flat | ) ."
