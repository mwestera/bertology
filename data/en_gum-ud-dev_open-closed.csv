"|1 In | |1 2015 | , |1 an | |0 initiative | |1 was | |0 started | to |0 set | |1 up | |1 a | |0 Dutch | |0 speaking | |0 DH+Lib | |0 community | |1 in | |1 the | |0 Netherlands | |1 and | |0 Belgium | , |0 based | |1 on | |1 the | |0 example | |1 of | |1 the | |0 American | |0 communal | |0 space | |1 of | |0 librarians | , |0 archivists | , |0 LIS | |0 graduate | |0 students | , |1 and | |0 information | |0 specialists | to |0 discuss | |0 topics | ‘ Where |1 the | |0 Digital | |0 Humanities | |1 and | |0 Libraries | |0 meet | ’ ."
|1 At | |1 the | |0 initial | |0 meeting | it |0 became | |0 apparent | that |0 most | |0 participants | |0 were | |0 there | to |0 learn | |0 more | |1 about | |0 digital | |0 humanities | |1 and | |0 were | not ( |0 yet | ) |1 in | |1 the | |0 situation | where they |1 were | |0 able | to |0 offer | |0 expertise | |1 on | |1 the | |0 subject | .
"|1 On | |1 the | |0 administrative | |0 level | , |1 the | |0 directors | |1 of | |1 the | |0 libraries | |0 participating | |1 in | |1 the | |0 consortium | |1 of | |0 Dutch | |0 academic | |0 libraries | ( |0 UKB | ) |0 also | |0 expressed | |1 the | |0 wish | that |0 librarians | |0 become | |0 more | |0 fluent | |1 in | |0 DH | ."
"|1 A | |0 year | |0 later | , |1 the | |0 National | |0 Library | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Netherlands | ( Koninklijke Bibliotheek ) , |1 and | |1 the | |0 University | |0 Library | |1 of | |1 the | Vrije Universiteit |0 Amsterdam | |0 again | |0 concluded | that |0 librarians | |1 at | their |0 institutes | who |0 wanted | to |1 get | |0 involved | |1 in | |0 DH | |0 needed | |0 more | |0 training | to |0 adequately | |0 support | |0 researchers | |1 and | |0 students | |1 in | |1 this | |0 field | ."
|0 Therefore | |1 both | |0 institutes | |0 joined | |0 forces | to |0 develop | |1 a | |0 set | |1 of | |0 clinics | |1 on | |0 DH | |1 for | |0 librarians | .
|1 The | |1 two | |0 institutes | |1 were | |0 later | |0 joined | |1 by | |1 the | |0 Leiden | |0 University | |0 Libraries | .
"We |0 see | this |1 as | |1 the | |0 ideal | |0 opportunity | to |0 provide | |1 these | |0 educative | |0 sessions | not |0 only | |1 to | our |0 own | |0 librarians | , |1 but | |0 also | |1 to | |1 the | |0 academic | |0 librarians | |1 of | |0 other | |0 Dutch | |0 research | |0 libraries | ."
"|1 In | |0 essence | , we |0 want | to |0 teach | our |0 country | ’s |0 librarians | |1 the | |0 ins | |1 and | |0 outs | |1 of | |0 DH | in |0 order | |1 for | them to |0 take | |1 up | their |0 natural | |0 role | of |0 facilitating | |1 and | |0 supporting | |0 research | |1 and | |0 ideally | |0 become | |1 the | |0 research | |0 partner | |0 needed | |1 in | |0 DH | |0 projects | ."
"|1 The | |0 aim | |1 of | |1 these | |0 clinics | |1 is | to |0 provide | |0 basic | |0 methodological | |0 competencies | |1 and | |0 technical | |0 skills | |1 in | |0 DH | , |1 for | |1 a | |0 diverse | |0 group | |1 of | |0 librarians | , |0 consisting | |1 of | both |0 subject | |1 and | |0 technical | |0 librarians | |1 with | |0 basic | |0 technical | |0 skills | ."
"|1 The | |0 content | |1 of | |1 these | |0 sessions | |1 should | |0 enable | them to |0 provide | |0 services | |1 to | |0 researchers | |1 and | |0 students | , |0 identify | |0 remaining | |0 gaps | |1 in | |0 knowledge | |1 or | |0 skills | that they |1 could | |0 address | |1 by | |0 self-directed | |0 learning | |1 and | ( |0 perhaps | ) to |0 automate | their |0 daily | |0 library | |0 work | ."
"We |1 are | not |0 setting | |1 out | to |0 turn | them |1 into | |0 programmers | |1 or | |0 data | |0 crunchers | , |1 but | |0 want | to |0 boost | their |0 knowledge | |0 level | |1 to | where they |0 feel | |0 comfortable | |0 providing | |0 information | |1 about | |0 DH | |0 projects | , |0 follow | |1 the | |0 literature | |1 and | |0 research | , |0 follow | |0 online | |0 tutorials | |1 and | |0 hopefully | |0 take | |1 up | |1 the | |0 challenge | of |0 finishing | |1 this | |0 professional | |0 development | by |0 engaging | |1 with | |1 the | |0 DH | |0 community | ."
"In |0 order | to |0 design | |1 this | |0 curriculum | we |0 follow | |1 a | |1 four | |0 step | |0 approach | |1 with | |1 a | |0 Working | |0 Out | |0 Loud | - |0 principle | ( |0 Williams | , |1 2010 | ) :"
"|0 Desk | |0 research | |1 about | what |1 being | |1 a | |0 DH | |0 librarian | |0 entails | ( e.g. |0 Hartsell-Gundy | et al. , |1 2015 | ; |0 Mulligan | , |1 2016 | ; |0 also | |0 see | |1 the | |0 Zotero | |0 library | |1 of | |1 the | |0 LIBER | |0 Digital | |0 Humanities | |0 working | |0 group | ) ;"

"With these |1 in | |0 hand | , we |1 will | |0 design | |1 the | |0 curriculum | |1 of | |0 clinics | , |0 based | |1 on | |1 the | |0 method | |1 of | ' |0 constructive | |0 alignment | ' ( |0 Biggs | et al. , |1 2011 | ) , to |0 make | |0 sure | that |1 the | |0 intended | |0 learning | |0 objectives | |1 and | |1 the | |0 teaching | / |0 learning | |0 activities | |0 stay | |0 aligned | ."
"Our |0 plan | |1 is | to |0 organize | |1 a | |0 maximum | |1 of | |1 6 | |0 clinics | , each |1 one | |0 full | |0 day | ."
"|1 Each | |0 day | |0 starts | |1 with | |1 one | |1 or | |0 more | |0 lectures | |1 by | |0 researchers | , that |0 address | |1 the | |0 conceptual | |0 knowledge | |0 needed | ."
"|1 The | |0 afternoon | |0 sessions | |1 will | |1 be | |0 devoted | |1 to | |1 the | |0 hands-on | |0 training | |1 of | |0 skills | , |0 following | |1 the | |0 Library | |0 Carpentry | |0 model | |0 as | |0 closely | |1 as | |0 possible | ."
"By |0 having | |0 researchers | |0 provide | |1 the | |0 lecture | |0 sessions | , we |0 hope | to |0 fuel | |1 the | |0 enthusiasm | |1 of | |1 the | |0 librarians | |1 with | |1 the | |0 inspiration | |1 of | |0 direct | |0 contact | |1 with | |0 researchers | |1 and | to |0 provide | |0 access | |1 to | |1 a | |0 network | |1 within | |1 and | |1 across | |0 universities | ."
"|1 With | |1 these | |0 clinics | , we |0 hope | to |0 initiate | |1 a | |0 stream | |1 of | |0 DH | |0 activities | |1 in | |0 Dutch | |0 universities | , |0 making | |0 access | |1 to | |0 support | |0 easier | |1 for | |0 new | |0 digital | |0 scholars | ."
"|1 The | |0 poster | |1 at | |0 DH2017 | |1 will | |0 present | |1 the | |0 curriculum | , its |0 position | |1 in | |1 the | |0 international | |0 context | |1 and | |0 offer | |1 the | |0 lessons | |0 learned | |1 from | |1 both | |1 the | |0 design | |0 process | |1 and | |1 the | |0 first | |0 clinics | ."

"|0 Joshua | |0 Abraham | |0 Norton | ( c. |1 1818 | |1 – | |0 January | |1 8 | , |1 1880 | ) , |0 known | |1 as | |0 Emperor | |0 Norton | , |1 was | |1 a | |0 citizen | |1 of | |0 San | |0 Francisco | , |0 California | , who |1 in | |1 1859 | |0 proclaimed | himself "" |0 Norton | |0 I | , |0 Emperor | |1 of | |1 the | |0 United | |0 States | "" ."
"He |0 later | |0 expanded | his |0 pretense | by |0 claiming | to |1 be | "" |0 Protector | |1 of | |0 Mexico | "" |0 as | |0 well | ."
"|0 Born | |1 in | |0 England | , |0 Norton | |0 spent | |0 most | |1 of | his |0 early | |0 life | |1 in | |0 South | |0 Africa | ."
"|1 After | |1 the | |0 death | |1 of | his |0 mother | |1 in | |1 1846 | |1 and | his |0 father | |1 in | |1 1848 | , he |0 sailed | |0 west | , |0 arriving | |1 in | |0 San | |0 Francisco | |0 possibly | |1 in | |0 November | |1 1849 | ."
"|0 Norton | |0 initially | |0 made | |1 a | |0 living | |1 as | |1 a | |0 businessman | , |1 but | he |0 lost | his |0 fortune | |0 investing | |1 in | |0 Peruvian | |0 rice | ."

"He |0 had | |1 no | |0 political | |0 power | , |1 and | his |0 influence | |0 extended | |0 only | |0 so | |0 far | as he |1 was | |0 humored | |1 by | those |1 around | him ;"
"|0 nevertheless | , he |1 was | |0 treated | |0 deferentially | |1 in | |0 San | |0 Francisco | , |1 and | |0 currency | |0 issued | |1 in | his |0 name | |1 was | |0 honored | |1 in | |1 the | |0 establishments | he |0 frequented | ."
"Though some |0 considered | him |0 insane | |1 or | |0 eccentric | , |0 citizens | |1 of | |0 San | |0 Francisco | |0 celebrated | his |0 regal | |0 presence | |1 and | his |0 proclamations | , |0 such | |1 as | his |0 order | that |1 the | |0 United | |0 States | |0 Congress | |1 be | |0 dissolved | |1 by | |0 force | |1 and | his |0 numerous | |0 decrees | |0 calling | for |1 a | |0 bridge | |0 connecting | |0 San | |0 Francisco | |1 to | |0 Oakland | , |1 and | |1 a | |0 corresponding | |0 tunnel | to |1 be | |0 built | |1 under | |0 San | |0 Francisco | |0 Bay | ."
"|0 Long | |1 after | his |0 death | , |0 similar | |0 structures | |1 were | |0 built | |1 in | |1 the | |0 form | |1 of | |1 the | |0 San | |0 Francisco | – |0 Oakland | |0 Bay | |0 Bridge | |1 and | |1 the | |0 Transbay | |0 Tube | , |1 and | there |1 have | |0 been | |0 campaigns | to |0 rename | |1 the | |0 bridge | "" |1 The | |0 Emperor | |0 Norton | |0 Bridge | "" ."
"|1 On | |0 January | |1 8 | , |1 1880 | , |0 Norton | |0 collapsed | |1 at | |1 the | |0 corner | |1 of | |0 California | |1 and | |0 Dupont | ( |0 now | |0 Grant | ) |0 streets | |1 and | |0 died | before he |1 could | |1 be | |0 given | |0 medical | |0 treatment | ."
"|0 Nearly | |1 30,000 | |0 people | |0 packed | |1 the | |0 streets | |1 of | |0 San | |0 Francisco | to |0 pay | him |0 homage | |1 at | his |0 funeral | ."

My |0 father | |1 and | I |1 were | |0 going | |1 to | |0 mass | — my |0 mother | |1 did | not |0 go | ; she |1 was | |0 Protestant | .

"When I |1 was | |1 a | |0 little | |0 girl | , he |0 did | that |0 often | , |1 and | |0 called | me |0 Muscles | ."

"I |1 could | not |0 help | |0 arching | my |0 back | |1 a | |0 little | , I |0 wanted | to |0 push | |1 against | his |0 hand | |1 like | |1 a | |0 cat | |1 but | |1 the | |0 instinct | that |0 comes | with |1 being | |1 thirteen | , |1 the | |0 half-understood | |0 caution | that |0 makes | |1 a | |0 girl | |0 timid | , |1 or | |0 wild | , |1 the | |0 shyness | |0 told | me to |0 just | |0 walk | ."

|0 Something | |0 else | |0 clicked | |1 and | I |0 tried | to |0 see | what it |0 was | |1 but | |1 could | n’t |0 see | |0 anything | .

|1 In | |1 fifteen | |0 minutes | we |1 would | |1 be | |0 home | |1 and | my |0 mother | |1 would | |0 fry | |0 eggs | .

"|0 Yes | , |1 all | |0 tropical | |0 cyclones | |1 are | |0 driven | |1 by | |0 high | |0 heat | |0 content | |0 waters | ."
"|0 Once | |1 a | |0 storm | |0 moves | |1 over | |1 any | |0 appreciably | |0 sized | |0 piece | |1 of | |0 land | , |1 the | |0 moisture | |0 source | |1 is | |0 removed | |1 and | |1 the | |0 storm | |0 begins | to |0 dissipate | ."
"|0 As | |1 of | |1 the | |0 last | |0 advisory | , |0 T | |0 C | |0 Phailin | |0 has | |0 winds | |1 of | |1 190 | |0 kilometers | |1 per | |0 hour | |1 and | |1 has | |0 moved | |0 inland | , |0 headed | |1 on | |1 a | |0 northwest | |0 track | ."
That |1 is | |1 a | |0 Category | |1 3 | |0 storm | .
|1 The | |0 forecast | |1 is | |1 for | |1 a | |0 continued | |0 decline | |1 in | |0 strength | |1 to | |1 a | |0 tropical | |0 storm | |1 within | |1 24 | |0 hours | |1 and | |1 a | |0 tropical | |0 depression | |1 within | |1 36 | |0 hours | .
"|0 However | , there |1 will | |1 be | |0 very | |0 heavy | |0 rains | |1 and | |0 flooding | |1 along | its |0 path | ."
"|0 Yes | , it |1 will | |0 loose | |0 strength | |0 steadily | as |0 more | |1 and | |0 more | |1 of | |1 this | |0 swirling | |0 system | |0 moves | from |0 being | |1 over | |0 ocean | to |0 being | |1 over | |0 land | ."
This |0 occurs | |1 for | |1 two | |0 reasons | :
"As it |0 moves | |1 over | |0 land | , it |1 is | |0 cut | |1 off | from |1 the | |0 source | |1 of | |0 energy | |0 driving | |1 the | |0 storm | [ which |1 is | ] |1 the | |0 evaporation | |1 of | |0 water | |1 from | |1 the | |0 warm | |0 sea | |0 surface | ;"
"|0 Increased | |0 friction | - |1 the | |0 ocean | |0 surface | |1 is | |0 much | , |0 much | |0 smoother | |1 than | |1 the | |0 land | |0 surface | ."
"|0 Tropical | |0 cyclones | |1 are | |0 sustained | |1 by | |1 a | |0 form | |1 of | |0 energy | |0 called | |0 latent | |0 heat | , which |1 is | |0 released | |1 by | |0 moisture | |0 evaporated | |1 from | |1 the | |0 ocean | that |0 condenses | to |0 form | |0 rain | ."
"As |0 tropical | |0 cyclones | |0 make | |0 landfall | , |1 this | |0 energy | |0 source | |1 is | |0 cut-off | |1 and | they |0 rapidly | |0 lose | |0 strength | as they |0 move | |1 over | |0 land | ."
"|0 Yes | , |1 the | |0 Cyclone | |1 is | |0 almost | |0 certain | to |0 lose | |0 strength | as it |0 surges | |1 over | |0 land | ."
|0 Cyclones | |0 gather | their |0 strength | through |0 scraping | |0 moisture | |1 and | |0 heat | |1 from | |0 warm | |0 ocean | |0 water | that it |1 is | not |1 the | |0 case | |1 over | |0 land | .
"|1 In | |1 the | |0 mean | |0 time | , |0 much | |0 stronger | |0 friction | |1 over | |0 land | |0 quickly | |0 reduces | their |0 strength | ."
|0 Yes | .
|1 All | |0 tropical | |0 cyclones | |0 lose | |0 strength | once they |0 make | |0 landfall | .
"|0 However | , they |1 can | |0 remain | |0 dangerous | |0 storms | |0 due | to |0 very | |0 heavy | |0 rains | |1 and | |0 subsequent | |0 landslides | , |1 and | |0 river | |0 flooding | ."
|0 Phailin | 's |0 winds | |1 will | |0 rapidly | |0 weaken | as it |0 pushes | |0 inland | .
Once |0 Cyclone | |0 Phailin | |0 comes | |1 on | |0 shore | it |1 will | |0 immediately | |0 begin | to |0 lose | |0 strength | .
"|0 However | , |1 and | this |1 is | |0 important | , it |0 still | |1 will | |0 contain | |0 lots | |1 of | |0 rainfall | |0 making | |0 flooding | |1 an | |0 almost | |0 certainty | ."

"I |1 do | n't |0 have | |0 enough | |0 information | to |0 answer | |1 this | |0 question | , |1 one | |0 way | |1 or | |1 the | |0 other | ."
"|1 From | all |1 the | |0 press | |0 reports | that I |1 have | |0 read | , |1 the | |0 Indian | |0 government | |0 appears | to |1 have | |0 taken | |1 the | |0 threat | |1 of | |0 Cyclone | |0 Phailin | |0 very | |0 seriously | |0 indeed | ."
|1 The | |0 government | |1 has | |1 been | |0 much | |0 more | |0 pro-active | in |0 preparing | |1 for | |1 this | |0 cyclone | than |1 in | |1 the | |0 past | .
|1 The | |0 forecasts | |1 of | |0 cyclone | |0 track | |1 and | |0 intensity | |1 have | |1 been | |0 fairly | |0 accurate | .

"|0 Unfortunately | , |0 extensive | |0 property | |0 damage | |1 is | |0 bound | to |0 occur | |0 even | |1 with | |1 the | |0 best | |0 preparation | ."
