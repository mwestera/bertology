"In 2015 , |6 an | |2 initiative | |5 was | |4 started | to |4 set | up |6 a | |7 Dutch | |4 speaking | |7 DH+Lib | |2 community | in |6 the | |7 Netherlands | and |7 Belgium | , |4 based | on |6 the | |2 example | of |6 the | |0 American | |0 communal | |2 space | of |2 librarians | , |2 archivists | , |7 LIS | |2 graduate | |2 students | , and |2 information | |2 specialists | to |4 discuss | |2 topics | ‘ Where |6 the | |0 Digital | |2 Humanities | and |2 Libraries | |4 meet | ’ ."
At |6 the | |0 initial | |2 meeting | |3 it | |4 became | |0 apparent | that |0 most | |2 participants | |4 were | |1 there | to |4 learn | |0 more | about |0 digital | |2 humanities | and |4 were | not ( |1 yet | ) in |6 the | |2 situation | where |3 they | |5 were | |0 able | to |4 offer | |2 expertise | on |6 the | |2 subject | .
"On |6 the | |0 administrative | |2 level | , |6 the | |2 directors | of |6 the | |2 libraries | |4 participating | in |6 the | |2 consortium | of |0 Dutch | |0 academic | |2 libraries | ( |7 UKB | ) |1 also | |4 expressed | |6 the | |2 wish | that |2 librarians | |4 become | |1 more | |0 fluent | in |7 DH | ."
"|6 A | |2 year | |1 later | , |6 the | |7 National | |7 Library | of |6 the | |7 Netherlands | ( Koninklijke Bibliotheek ) , and |6 the | |7 University | |7 Library | of |6 the | Vrije Universiteit |7 Amsterdam | |1 again | |4 concluded | that |2 librarians | at |3 their | |2 institutes | |3 who | |4 wanted | to |5 get | |4 involved | in |7 DH | |4 needed | |0 more | |2 training | to |1 adequately | |4 support | |2 researchers | and |2 students | in |6 this | |2 field | ."
|1 Therefore | |6 both | |2 institutes | |4 joined | |2 forces | to |4 develop | |6 a | |2 set | of |2 clinics | on |7 DH | for |2 librarians | .
|6 The | two |2 institutes | |5 were | |1 later | |4 joined | by |6 the | |7 Leiden | |7 University | |7 Libraries | .
"|3 We | |4 see | |3 this | as |6 the | |0 ideal | |2 opportunity | to |4 provide | |6 these | |0 educative | |2 sessions | not |1 only | to |3 our | |0 own | |2 librarians | , but |1 also | to |6 the | |0 academic | |2 librarians | of |0 other | |0 Dutch | |2 research | |2 libraries | ."
"In |2 essence | , |3 we | |4 want | to |4 teach | |3 our | |2 country | ’s |2 librarians | |6 the | |2 ins | and |2 outs | of |7 DH | in |2 order | for |3 them | to |4 take | up |3 their | |0 natural | |2 role | of |4 facilitating | and |4 supporting | |2 research | and |1 ideally | |4 become | |6 the | |2 research | |2 partner | |4 needed | in |7 DH | |2 projects | ."
"|6 The | |2 aim | of |6 these | |2 clinics | |5 is | to |4 provide | |0 basic | |0 methodological | |2 competencies | and |0 technical | |2 skills | in |7 DH | , for |6 a | |0 diverse | |2 group | of |2 librarians | , |4 consisting | of |3 both | |2 subject | and |0 technical | |2 librarians | with |0 basic | |0 technical | |2 skills | ."
"|6 The | |2 content | of |6 these | |2 sessions | |5 should | |4 enable | |3 them | to |4 provide | |2 services | to |2 researchers | and |2 students | , |4 identify | |4 remaining | |2 gaps | in |2 knowledge | or |2 skills | |3 that | |3 they | |5 could | |4 address | by |0 self-directed | |2 learning | and ( |1 perhaps | ) to |4 automate | |3 their | |0 daily | |2 library | |2 work | ."
"|3 We | |5 are | not |4 setting | out to |4 turn | |3 them | into |2 programmers | or |2 data | |2 crunchers | , but |4 want | to |4 boost | |3 their | |2 knowledge | |2 level | to where |3 they | |4 feel | |0 comfortable | |4 providing | |2 information | about |7 DH | |2 projects | , |4 follow | |6 the | |2 literature | and |2 research | , |4 follow | |0 online | |2 tutorials | and |1 hopefully | |4 take | up |6 the | |2 challenge | of |4 finishing | |6 this | |0 professional | |2 development | by |4 engaging | with |6 the | |7 DH | |2 community | ."
"In |2 order | to |4 design | |6 this | |2 curriculum | |3 we | |4 follow | |6 a | four |2 step | |2 approach | with |6 a | |7 Working | |7 Out | |7 Loud | - |2 principle | ( |7 Williams | , 2010 ) :"
"|2 Desk | |2 research | about |3 what | |5 being | |6 a | |7 DH | |2 librarian | |4 entails | ( e.g. |7 Hartsell-Gundy | et al. , 2015 ; |7 Mulligan | , 2016 ; |1 also | |4 see | |6 the | |7 Zotero | |2 library | of |6 the | |7 LIBER | |7 Digital | |7 Humanities | |4 working | |2 group | ) ;"
"|4 Identify | |0 possible | |2 subjects | , |4 based | on |2 experience | , |6 a | |2 comparison | of |4 existing | |2 teaching | |2 material | |4 related | to |7 DH | ( e.g. |6 The | |7 Programming | |7 Historian | , |6 the | |7 Digital | |7 Scholarship | |7 Training | |7 Programme | at |6 the | |7 British | |7 Library | and |7 Columbia | |7 University | 's |7 Developing | |7 Librarian | |2 project | ) and |6 the | |7 TaDiRAH | |2 taxonomy | of |2 research | |2 activities | ;"
"|4 Get | |2 feedback | from |2 researchers | on |0 possible | |2 subjects | , |4 based | on |6 the | |2 knowledge | and |2 skills | |3 they | |4 feel | |2 librarians | |4 need | ;"
"|4 Get | |2 feedback | from |2 librarians | on |0 possible | |2 subjects | , |4 based | on |1 already | |4 known | |2 gaps | in |3 their | |2 knowledge | and |2 skills | ."
"With |3 these | in |2 hand | , |3 we | |5 will | |4 design | |6 the | |2 curriculum | of |2 clinics | , |4 based | on |6 the | |2 method | of ' |0 constructive | |2 alignment | ' ( |7 Biggs | et al. , 2011 ) , to |4 make | |0 sure | that |6 the | |4 intended | |2 learning | |2 objectives | and |6 the | |2 teaching | / |2 learning | |2 activities | |4 stay | |4 aligned | ."
"|3 Our | |2 plan | |5 is | to |4 organize | |6 a | |2 maximum | of 6 |2 clinics | , |3 each | one |0 full | |2 day | ."
"|6 Each | |2 day | |4 starts | with one or |0 more | |2 lectures | by |2 researchers | , |3 that | |4 address | |6 the | |0 conceptual | |2 knowledge | |4 needed | ."
"|6 The | |2 afternoon | |2 sessions | |5 will | |5 be | |4 devoted | to |6 the | |0 hands-on | |2 training | of |2 skills | , |4 following | |6 the | |7 Library | |7 Carpentry | |2 model | |1 as | |1 closely | as |0 possible | ."
"By |4 having | |2 researchers | |4 provide | |6 the | |2 lecture | |2 sessions | , |3 we | |4 hope | to |4 fuel | |6 the | |2 enthusiasm | of |6 the | |2 librarians | with |6 the | |2 inspiration | of |0 direct | |2 contact | with |2 researchers | and to |4 provide | |2 access | to |6 a | |2 network | within and across |2 universities | ."
"With |6 these | |2 clinics | , |3 we | |4 hope | to |4 initiate | |6 a | |2 stream | of |7 DH | |2 activities | in |0 Dutch | |2 universities | , |4 making | |2 access | to |2 support | |0 easier | for |0 new | |0 digital | |2 scholars | ."
"|6 The | |2 poster | at |7 DH2017 | |5 will | |4 present | |6 the | |2 curriculum | , |3 its | |2 position | in |6 the | |0 international | |2 context | and |4 offer | |6 the | |2 lessons | |4 learned | from both |6 the | |2 design | |2 process | and |6 the | |0 first | |2 clinics | ."
|3 We | |4 welcome | |2 discussion | about |3 our | |2 efforts | and |6 the | |2 possibilities | of |4 applying | |3 this | in |0 other | |2 contexts | .
|7 Emperor | |7 Norton |
"|7 Joshua | |7 Abraham | |7 Norton | ( c. 1818 – |7 January | 8 , 1880 ) , |4 known | as |7 Emperor | |7 Norton | , |5 was | |6 a | |2 citizen | of |7 San | |7 Francisco | , |7 California | , |3 who | in 1859 |4 proclaimed | |3 himself | "" |7 Norton | |7 I | , |7 Emperor | of |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | "" ."
"|3 He | |1 later | |4 expanded | |3 his | |2 pretense | by |4 claiming | to |5 be | "" |7 Protector | of |7 Mexico | "" |1 as | |1 well | ."
"|4 Born | in |7 England | , |7 Norton | |4 spent | |0 most | of |3 his | |0 early | |2 life | in |7 South | |7 Africa | ."
"After |6 the | |2 death | of |3 his | |2 mother | in 1846 and |3 his | |2 father | in 1848 , |3 he | |4 sailed | |1 west | , |4 arriving | in |7 San | |7 Francisco | |1 possibly | in |7 November | 1849 ."
"|7 Norton | |1 initially | |4 made | |6 a | |2 living | as |6 a | |2 businessman | , but |3 he | |4 lost | |3 his | |2 fortune | |4 investing | in |0 Peruvian | |2 rice | ."
"After |3 he | |4 lost | |6 a | |2 lawsuit | in |3 which | |3 he | |4 tried | to |4 void | |3 his | |2 rice | |2 contract | , |7 Norton | 's |0 public | |2 prominence | |4 faded | ."
"|3 He | |4 reemerged | in |7 September | 1859 , |4 laying | |2 claim | to |6 the | |2 position | of |7 Emperor | of |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | ."
"|3 He | |4 had | |6 no | |0 political | |2 power | , and |3 his | |2 influence | |4 extended | |1 only | |1 so | |1 far | as |3 he | |5 was | |4 humored | by |3 those | around |3 him | ;"
"|1 nevertheless | , |3 he | |5 was | |4 treated | |1 deferentially | in |7 San | |7 Francisco | , and |2 currency | |4 issued | in |3 his | |2 name | |5 was | |4 honored | in |6 the | |2 establishments | |3 he | |4 frequented | ."
"Though |3 some | |4 considered | |3 him | |0 insane | or |0 eccentric | , |2 citizens | of |7 San | |7 Francisco | |4 celebrated | |3 his | |0 regal | |2 presence | and |3 his | |2 proclamations | , |0 such | as |3 his | |2 order | that |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | |7 Congress | |5 be | |4 dissolved | by |2 force | and |3 his | |0 numerous | |2 decrees | |4 calling | for |6 a | |2 bridge | |4 connecting | |7 San | |7 Francisco | to |7 Oakland | , and |6 a | |0 corresponding | |2 tunnel | to |5 be | |4 built | under |7 San | |7 Francisco | |7 Bay | ."
"|1 Long | after |3 his | |2 death | , |0 similar | |2 structures | |5 were | |4 built | in |6 the | |2 form | of |6 the | |7 San | |7 Francisco | – |7 Oakland | |7 Bay | |7 Bridge | and |6 the | |7 Transbay | |7 Tube | , and |3 there | |5 have | |4 been | |2 campaigns | to |4 rename | |6 the | |2 bridge | "" |6 The | |7 Emperor | |7 Norton | |7 Bridge | "" ."
"On |7 January | 8 , 1880 , |7 Norton | |4 collapsed | at |6 the | |2 corner | of |7 California | and |7 Dupont | ( |1 now | |7 Grant | ) |2 streets | and |4 died | before |3 he | |5 could | |5 be | |4 given | |0 medical | |2 treatment | ."
"|1 Nearly | 30,000 |2 people | |4 packed | |6 the | |2 streets | of |7 San | |7 Francisco | to |4 pay | |3 him | |2 homage | at |3 his | |2 funeral | ."
"|7 Norton | |5 has | |5 been | |4 immortalized | as |6 the | |2 basis | of |2 characters | in |6 the | |2 literature | of |2 writers | |7 Mark | |7 Twain | , |7 Robert | |7 Louis | |7 Stevenson | , |7 Christopher | |7 Moore | , |7 Morris | and |7 Goscinny | , |7 Selma | |7 Lagerlöf | , and |7 Neil | |7 Gaiman | ."

"|7 Emperor | |7 Joshua | |7 Norton | , in |0 full | |0 military | |2 regalia | , circa 1880 or |1 earlier |"
"By 1859 , |7 Norton | |5 had | |4 become | |1 completely | |0 disgruntled | with |3 what | |3 he | |4 considered | |6 the | |2 inadequacies | of |6 the | |0 legal | and |0 political | |2 structures | of |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | ."
"On |7 September | 17 , 1859 , |3 he | |4 took | |2 matters | into |3 his | |0 own | |2 hands | and |4 distributed | |2 letters | to |6 the | |0 various | |2 newspapers | in |6 the | |2 city | , |4 proclaiming | |3 himself | "" |7 Emperor | of |6 these | |7 United | |7 States | "" :"
"At |6 the | |0 peremptory | |2 request | and |2 desire | of |6 a | |0 large | |2 majority | of |6 the | |2 citizens | of |6 these | |7 United | |7 States | , |3 I | , |7 Joshua | |7 Norton | , |1 formerly | of |7 Algoa | |7 Bay | , |7 Cape | of |7 Good | |7 Hope | , and |1 now | for |6 the | |0 last | 9 |2 years | and 10 |2 months | |0 past | of |7 S.F. | , |7 Cal. | , |4 declare | and |4 proclaim | |3 myself | |7 Emperor | of |6 these | |7 U.S. | ;"
"and in |2 virtue | of |6 the | |2 authority | |1 thereby | in |3 me | |4 vested | , |5 do | |1 hereby | |4 order | and |4 direct | |6 the | |2 representatives | of |6 the | |0 different | |2 States | of |6 the | |7 Union | to |4 assemble | in |7 Musical | |7 Hall | , of |6 this | |2 city | , on |6 the | |0 1st | |2 day | of |7 Feb. | |0 next | , |1 then | and |1 there | to |4 make | |6 such | |2 alterations | in |6 the | |4 existing | |2 laws | of |6 the | |7 Union | as |5 may | |4 ameliorate | |6 the | |2 evils | under |3 which | |6 the | |2 country | |5 is | |4 laboring | , and |1 thereby | |4 cause | |2 confidence | to |4 exist | , both at |2 home | and |2 abroad | , in |3 our | |2 stability | and |2 integrity | ."

|6 The | |2 announcement | |5 was | |1 first | |4 reprinted | for |0 humorous | |2 effect | by |6 the | |2 editor | of |6 the | |7 San | |7 Francisco | |7 Bulletin | .
"|7 Norton | |5 would | |1 later | |4 add | "" |7 Protector | of |7 Mexico | "" to |6 this | |2 title | ."

One of |7 Norton | 's |0 undated | |2 proclamations |
"In |3 his | |0 self-appointed | |2 role | of |2 emperor | , |7 Norton | |4 issued | |0 numerous | |2 decrees | on |2 matters | of |6 the | |2 state | ."
"After |4 assuming | |0 absolute | |2 control | over |6 the | |2 country | , |3 he | |4 saw | |6 no | |0 further | |2 need | for |6 a | |2 legislature | , and on |7 October | 12 , 1859 , |3 he | |4 issued | |6 a | |2 decree | |1 formally | |4 abolishing | |6 the | |7 United | |7 States | |7 Congress | ."
"In |3 it | , |7 Norton | |4 observed | :"

that |6 the | |2 citizen | |4 has | not |6 that | |2 protection | of |2 person | and |2 property | |3 which | |3 he | |5 is | |4 entitled | .
"|7 Norton | |4 ordered | |6 all | |0 interested | |2 parties | to |4 assemble | at |7 Platt | 's |7 Music | |7 Hall | in |7 San | |7 Francisco | in |7 February | 1860 to "" |4 remedy | |6 the | |2 evil | |4 complained | of "" ."
"In |6 an | |0 imperial | |2 decree | |6 the | |4 following | |2 month | , |7 Norton | |4 summoned | |6 the | |7 Army | to |4 depose | |6 the | |4 elected | |2 officials | of |6 the | |7 U.S. | |7 Congress | :"

|3 I | |5 was | thirteen .
"|3 It | |5 was | |2 spring | , |6 the | |0 barren | |2 time | in |7 March | when |3 you | |5 can | not |5 be | |0 sure | if |3 it | |5 is | |1 really | |0 warmer | , but |3 you | |5 are | |1 so | |0 desperate | for |2 change | that |3 you | |4 tell | |3 yourself | |6 the | |2 mud | at |6 the | |2 edge | of |6 the | |2 sidewalk | |5 is | |0 different | from |2 winter | |2 mud | and |3 you | |5 are | |0 sure | that |6 the | |2 smell | of |0 wet | |2 soil | |4 has | |1 suddenly | |6 a | |2 bit | of |6 the | |2 scent | of |2 summer | |2 rains | , of |2 grass | and |0 drowned | |2 earthworms | ."
"And |3 it | |4 has | , because |3 it | |5 is | |2 spring | and inside |6 the | |2 ground | |2 something | |5 is | |4 stirring | ."
|3 I | |5 was | |4 wearing | |6 a | |0 yellow | |2 linen | |2 dress | |3 which | |3 my | |2 mother | |5 had | |4 picked | out and |3 which | |3 I | |1 therefore | |4 disliked | although |3 I | |4 knew | |3 it | |4 flattered | |3 me | .

"|3 My | |2 father | |4 put | |3 his | |2 hand | on |2 top | of |3 my | |2 hair | , |3 his | |2 palm | on |3 my | |2 head | , and |3 I | |5 could | |4 feel | |6 the | |2 bone | of |3 my | |2 skull | and |3 my | |2 skin | and |3 his | |0 hot | |2 palm | , |1 so | |0 dry | and |0 strong | ."
"When |3 I | |5 was | |6 a | |0 little | |2 girl | , |3 he | |4 did | |3 that | |1 often | , and |4 called | |3 me | |7 Muscles | ."
|3 He | |5 had | not |4 called | |3 me | |7 Muscles | or |4 put | |3 his | |2 hand | on |3 my | |2 head | for |6 a | |0 long | |2 time | .
"|3 I | |5 could | not |4 help | |4 arching | |3 my | |2 back | |6 a | |0 little | , |3 I | |4 wanted | to |4 push | against |3 his | |2 hand | like |6 a | |2 cat | but |6 the | |2 instinct | |3 that | |4 comes | with |5 being | thirteen , |6 the | |0 half-understood | |2 caution | that |4 makes | |6 a | |2 girl | |0 timid | , or |0 wild | , |6 the | |2 shyness | |4 told | |3 me | to |1 just | |4 walk | ."

"|1 Instead | |3 I | |4 went | into |6 the | |2 church | , |4 took | |6 a | |2 Bulletin | , |4 dipped | |3 my | |2 finger | in |0 Holy | |2 Water | and |4 genuflected | ."
"|6 The | |2 inside | of |6 the | |2 church | |4 smelled | like |0 damp | |2 wood | and |2 furniture | |2 polish | , not |0 alive | at |3 all | ."
|3 My | |2 father | |4 took | off |3 his | |2 coat | and |4 draped | |3 it | over |6 the | |2 edge | of |6 the | |2 pew | and when |3 I | |4 came | |1 back | from |2 communion | |3 I | |4 stole | |3 his | |2 glove | .
|6 The | |2 paper | |2 taste | of |6 the | |2 wafer | |5 was | |1 still | in |3 my | |2 mouth | and |3 I | |4 took | |6 a | |0 deep | |2 breath | of |6 the | |2 leather | .
|3 It | |4 smelled | like |7 March | .
"|3 We | |4 walked | |1 back | through |6 the | |2 school | because |3 it | |5 was | |4 drizzling | , |3 my | |2 father | |0 tall | in |3 his | |0 navy | |2 suit | and |3 my | |2 shoes | |4 going | |2 click | on |6 the | |2 linoleum | ."

"|6 The | |2 hall | |4 ended | in |6 a | |2 T | and |3 we | |4 went | |1 left | through |6 the | |2 gym | , |4 walked | underneath |6 the | |2 bleachers | and |4 stood | |0 next | to |6 the | |2 side | |2 door | , |4 waiting | for |6 the | |2 rain | to |4 stop | ."
|3 It | |5 was | |0 dark | under |6 the | |2 bleachers | .
"|3 My | |2 father | |5 was | |6 a | |0 young | |2 man | , thirty-five , |0 younger | because |3 he | |4 liked | to |4 be | |0 outside | , to |4 play | |2 softball | on |7 Saturday | and to |4 take | |3 my | |2 mother | and |3 me | |4 camping | on |2 vacation | ."
|3 He | |4 stood | |4 rocked | |1 back | on |3 his | |2 heels | with |3 his | |2 coat | |4 thrown | over |3 his | |2 shoulders | and |3 his | |2 hands | in |3 his | |2 pockets | .
"|3 I | |4 thought | of |2 bacon | and |2 eggs | , |2 toast | with |2 peach | |2 jam | out of |6 the | |2 jar | ."
|3 I | |5 was | |1 so | |0 hungry | .
|6 The | |2 space | under |6 the | |2 bleachers | |5 was | |0 secret | and |0 dark | .
"|3 There | |4 were | |2 things | in |6 the | |2 shadows | ; |6 a | |2 metal | |2 pail | , |6 a | |2 mop | , |2 rags | ."
|0 Next | to |6 the | |2 door | |5 was | |6 a | |0 tall | |0 wrought-iron | |2 candle | |2 holder | — |6 the | |2 kind | |3 that | |4 stood | at |6 either | |2 end | of |6 the | |2 altar | .

"|6 The | |2 light | from |6 the | |2 door | |4 made | |6 the | |2 shadows | under |6 the | |2 bleachers | |0 darker | , |6 the | |0 long | |2 space | |4 stretched | |1 far | |1 away | ."
|3 I | |4 heard | |6 the | |2 rain | and |6 the | |0 faint | |2 rustle | of |2 paper | and |4 smelled | |0 damp | |2 concrete | .
"|3 I | |5 did | not |4 go | near |3 my | |2 father | but |4 kept | |3 my | |2 hand | in |3 my | |2 pocket | , |4 feeling | |6 the | |0 soft | |2 leather | |2 glove | ."
|3 There | |4 was | |6 a | |2 rustling | on |6 the | |2 concrete | and |6 the | |2 drizzle | of |0 soft | |2 rain | .

|6 The | |2 rustling | |5 might | |5 have | |5 been | |2 mice | .

"|7 Cyclone | |7 Phailin | |4 has | |2 winds | |3 that | |5 have | |5 been | |4 measured | at 200 |2 km | / |2 h | , as |3 it | |4 surges | over |2 land | |5 will | |3 it | |4 begin | to |4 lose | |2 strength | ?"
"Yes , |6 all | |0 tropical | |2 cyclones | |5 are | |4 driven | by |0 high | |2 heat | |2 content | |2 waters | ."
"|1 Once | |6 a | |2 storm | |4 moves | over |6 any | |1 appreciably | |4 sized | |2 piece | of |2 land | , |6 the | |2 moisture | |2 source | |5 is | |4 removed | and |6 the | |2 storm | |4 begins | to |4 dissipate | ."
"|1 As | of |6 the | |0 last | |2 advisory | , |7 T | |7 C | |7 Phailin | |4 has | |2 winds | of 190 |2 kilometers | per |2 hour | and |5 has | |4 moved | |1 inland | , |4 headed | on |6 a | |0 northwest | |2 track | ."
|3 That | |5 is | |6 a | |2 Category | 3 |2 storm | .
|6 The | |2 forecast | |5 is | for |6 a | |4 continued | |2 decline | in |2 strength | to |6 a | |0 tropical | |2 storm | within 24 |2 hours | and |6 a | |0 tropical | |2 depression | within 36 |2 hours | .
"|1 However | , |3 there | |5 will | |5 be | |1 very | |0 heavy | |2 rains | and |4 flooding | along |3 its | |2 path | ."
"Yes , |3 it | |5 will | |4 loose | |2 strength | |1 steadily | as |0 more | and |0 more | of |6 this | |4 swirling | |2 system | |4 moves | from |4 being | over |2 ocean | to |4 being | over |2 land | ."
|3 This | |4 occurs | for two |2 reasons | :
"As |3 it | |4 moves | over |2 land | , |3 it | |5 is | |4 cut | off from |6 the | |2 source | of |2 energy | |4 driving | |6 the | |2 storm | [ |3 which | |5 is | ] |6 the | |2 evaporation | of |2 water | from |6 the | |0 warm | |2 sea | |2 surface | ;"
"|4 Increased | |2 friction | - |6 the | |2 ocean | |2 surface | |5 is | |1 much | , |1 much | |0 smoother | than |6 the | |2 land | |2 surface | ."
"|0 Tropical | |2 cyclones | |5 are | |4 sustained | by |6 a | |2 form | of |2 energy | |4 called | |0 latent | |2 heat | , |3 which | |5 is | |4 released | by |2 moisture | |4 evaporated | from |6 the | |2 ocean | |3 that | |4 condenses | to |4 form | |2 rain | ."
"As |0 tropical | |2 cyclones | |4 make | |2 landfall | , |6 this | |2 energy | |2 source | |5 is | |4 cut-off | and |3 they | |1 rapidly | |4 lose | |2 strength | as |3 they | |4 move | over |2 land | ."
"Yes , |6 the | |7 Cyclone | |5 is | |1 almost | |0 certain | to |4 lose | |2 strength | as |3 it | |4 surges | over |2 land | ."
|2 Cyclones | |4 gather | |3 their | |2 strength | through |4 scraping | |2 moisture | and |2 heat | from |0 warm | |2 ocean | |2 water | that |3 it | |5 is | not |6 the | |2 case | over |2 land | .
"In |6 the | |0 mean | |2 time | , |1 much | |0 stronger | |2 friction | over |2 land | |1 quickly | |4 reduces | |3 their | |2 strength | ."
Yes .
|6 All | |0 tropical | |2 cyclones | |4 lose | |2 strength | once |3 they | |4 make | |2 landfall | .
"|1 However | , |3 they | |5 can | |4 remain | |0 dangerous | |2 storms | |0 due | to |1 very | |0 heavy | |2 rains | and |0 subsequent | |2 landslides | , and |2 river | |2 flooding | ."
|7 Phailin | 's |2 winds | |5 will | |1 rapidly | |4 weaken | as |3 it | |4 pushes | |1 inland | .
Once |7 Cyclone | |7 Phailin | |4 comes | on |2 shore | |3 it | |5 will | |1 immediately | |4 begin | to |4 lose | |2 strength | .
"|1 However | , and |3 this | |5 is | |0 important | , |3 it | |1 still | |5 will | |4 contain | |2 lots | of |2 rainfall | |4 making | |4 flooding | |6 an | |0 almost | |2 certainty | ."

|6 The | |2 government | |5 has | |5 been | |1 much | |1 more | |0 pro-active | in |4 preparing | for |6 this | |2 cyclone | than in |6 the | |2 past | .

"|4 Given | |6 the | |4 living | |2 standard | and |2 residence | of |2 people | |4 living | near |6 the | |0 coastal | |2 areas | in |6 this | |2 region | , |6 the | |2 evacuation | |5 is | |1 certainly | |0 necessary | and |0 essential | to |4 save | |2 lives | ."
|3 I | |5 cannot | |4 comment | |1 directly | on how |6 the | |0 Indian | |2 government | |5 was | |4 prepared | for |6 this | |2 cyclone | .
"|1 However | , |6 the | |2 news | |4 reports | ( |7 BBC | etc. ) |5 were | |1 very | |4 encouraging | in that |6 the | |2 authorities | |5 were | |1 reportedly | |4 making | |0 strenuous | |2 efforts | to |4 evacuate | |6 the | |2 population | from near |6 the | |2 coast | and |2 areas | |3 that | |5 are | |0 prone | to |2 flooding | ."

|4 Decide | on |6 a | |2 target | .

|4 Make | |6 the | |2 joke | |3 your | |0 own | .
|2 Lots | of |2 jokes | |4 rehash | |6 the | |0 same | |2 ground | and |1 sometimes | |3 they | |4 retell | |6 a | |2 story | |0 countless | |0 other | |2 jokes | |5 have | |4 told | .

"|4 Memorized | |2 jokes | |4 sound | |0 wooden | , like |3 they | |5 are | |5 being | |4 read | off |6 a | |2 script | instead of |4 relayed | by |6 a | |2 friend | or |2 entertainer | ."

"|3 What | |3 you | |5 do | n’t |4 want | to |4 wash | with |3 them | |5 is | |2 anything | |3 that | |5 can | |5 get | |4 twisted | up with |6 the | |2 straps | , like |2 women | ’s |0 long | |2 sleeve | |2 shirts | or |2 kids | ’ |2 blankets | ."
