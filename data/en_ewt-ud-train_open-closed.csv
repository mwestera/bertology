[ |1 This | |0 killing | |1 of | |1 a | |0 respected | |0 cleric | |1 will | |1 be | |0 causing | us |0 trouble | |1 for | |0 years | to |0 come | . ]
|0 DPA | : |0 Iraqi | |0 authorities | |0 announced | that they |1 had | |0 busted | |1 up | |1 3 | |0 terrorist | |0 cells | |0 operating | |1 in | |0 Baghdad | .
|1 Two | |1 of | them |1 were | |1 being | |0 run | |1 by | |1 2 | |0 officials | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Ministry | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Interior | !
"|1 The | |0 MoI | |1 in | |0 Iraq | |1 is | |0 equivalent | |1 to | |1 the | |0 US | |0 FBI | , |0 so | this |1 would | |0 be | like |0 having | |0 J. | |0 Edgar | |0 Hoover | |0 unwittingly | |0 employ | |1 at | |1 a | |0 high | |0 level | |0 members | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Weathermen | |0 bombers | |0 back | |1 in | |1 the | |0 1960s | ."
|1 The | |0 third | |1 was | |1 being | |0 run | |1 by | |1 the | |0 head | |1 of | |1 an | |0 investment | |0 firm | .
You |0 wonder | if he |1 was | |0 manipulating | |1 the | |0 market | |1 with | his |0 bombing | |0 targets | .
|1 The | |0 cells | |1 were | |0 operating | |1 in | |1 the | |0 Ghazaliyah | |1 and | |0 al | - |0 Jihad | |0 districts | |1 of | |1 the | |0 capital | .
"Although |1 the | |0 announcement | |1 was | |0 probably | |0 made | to |0 show | |0 progress | in |0 identifying | |1 and | |0 breaking | |1 up | |0 terror | |0 cells | , I |1 do | n't |0 find | |1 the | |0 news | that |1 the | |0 Baathists | |0 continue | to |0 penetrate | |1 the | |0 Iraqi | |0 government | |0 very | |0 hopeful | ."
It |0 reminds | me |0 too | |0 much | |1 of | |1 the | |0 ARVN | |0 officers | who |1 were | |0 secretly | |0 working | |1 for | |1 the | |0 other | |0 side | |1 in | |0 Vietnam | .
|0 Al | - |0 Zaman | : |0 Guerrillas | |0 killed | |1 a | |0 member | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Kurdistan | |0 Democratic | |0 Party | after |0 kidnapping | him |1 in | |0 Mosul | .
"|1 The | |0 police | |0 commander | |1 of | |0 Ninevah | |0 Province | |0 announced | that |0 bombings | |1 had | |0 declined | |1 80 | |0 percent | |1 in | |0 Mosul | , whereas there |1 had | |0 been | |1 a | |0 big | |0 jump | |1 in | |1 the | |0 number | |1 of | |0 kidnappings | ."

|1 This | |0 willingness | |1 is | |1 the | |0 main | |0 difference | |1 in | |1 the | |0 number | |1 of | |0 bombings | |1 in | |1 the | |0 south | as |0 opposed | |1 to | |1 the | |0 center | - |0 north | |1 of | |1 the | |0 country | . )

"|0 Guerrillas | |1 near | |0 Hawijah | |0 launched | |1 an | |0 attack | that |0 left | |1 6 | |0 dead | , |0 including | |1 4 | |0 Iraqi | |0 soldiers | ."

|1 The | |0 Commission | |0 said | it |0 had | |1 no | |0 legal | |0 grounds | |1 for | |1 such | |1 an | |0 exclusion | .
|1 This | |0 item | |1 is | |1 a | |0 small | |0 one | |1 and | |0 easily | |0 missed | .
|1 But | |1 in | my |0 view | it |1 is | |0 highly | |0 significant | .
"|1 The | |0 Debaathification | |0 Commission | |1 had | |1 been | |0 pushed | |1 by | |0 Ahmad | |0 Chalabi | |1 and | his |0 Iraqi | |0 National | |0 Congress | |0 very | |0 hard | , |1 and | |1 had | |0 pushed | |0 many | |0 Sunni | |0 Arabs | |1 into | |1 the | |0 arms | |1 of | |1 the | |0 guerrillas | ."

|0 Now | |1 the | |0 Electoral | |0 Commission | |1 is | |0 refusing | to |0 punish | |0 people | |1 for | |0 mere | |0 past | |0 Baath | |0 Party | |0 membership | .
|1 The | |0 situation | |1 in | |0 Iraq | |1 is | |0 only | |0 going | to |0 get | |0 better | |1 this | |0 way | .

|0 Al | - |0 Sharq | |0 al | - |0 Awsat | |0 reports | that |1 a | |0 key | |0 eyewitness | |1 in | |1 the | |0 trial | |1 of | |0 Saddam | |0 Hussein | |1 for | |1 a | |1 1982 | |0 massacre | |1 at | |0 Dujail | |1 has | |0 died | .

I |1 would | |1 be | |0 interested | in |0 hearing | |1 what | |0 conclusions | you |0 reached | |1 and | what you |0 found | that |1 was | |0 most | |0 convincing | .
|0 radiation | :
|1 As | |1 a | |0 child | |1 in | |1 the | |0 50's | I |0 had | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | |0 glandular | |0 problems | |1 and | they |0 treated | it |1 with | |0 radiation | |0 therapy | ( |0 primitive | |1 at | |0 best | ! ) |1 and | |0 stopped | |0 when | |1 a | |0 lesion | |1 on | my |0 neck | |0 started | |0 enlarging | -- they |0 said | it |1 was | not |0 CA | |1 but | |0 stopped | |1 the | |0 treatments | ....
|0 Remember | |1 the | |0 old | |0 shoe | |0 sizing | |0 machines | that |1 was | |1 a | |0 form | |1 of | |0 radiation | |0 xray | ?
That |0 too | |1 was | |0 stopped | .
|1 Do | n't |0 have | to |0 mention | what |0 radiation | |1 has | |0 done | |1 and | |1 is | |0 still | |0 doing | |1 to | |0 Hirsohima | |1 & | |0 Nagaski | |0 folks | -- there |1 can | |0 be | |1 no | |0 doubts | |1 about | |1 the | |0 effects | |1 of | |0 radiation | |1 in | |0 Chernobyl | .......
|1 The | |0 Chernobyl | |0 Children | 's |0 Project | ( http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp ) |0 offers | |0 several | |0 ways | to |0 help | |1 the | |0 children | |1 of | |1 that | |0 region | .
"|1 One | |1 of | them |1 is | |1 the | |0 Rest | |1 and | |0 Recuperation | |0 Program | , |0 wherein | |1 a | |0 child | |1 can | |0 come | |1 to | |1 the | |0 US | |1 for | |1 a | |0 few | |0 weeks | |1 in | |1 the | |0 summer | ."
"|0 Even | |1 a | |0 little | |0 time | |0 spent | |0 receiving | |0 wholesome | , |0 uncontaminated | |0 food | , |0 good | |0 medical | |0 care | , etc. |1 can | |0 add | |0 years | |1 to | their |0 lives | ."
|0 S. | |1 and | I |0 have | |1 an | |0 acquaintance | who |1 has | |0 hosted | |0 several | |1 of | |1 these | |0 children | |1 for | |0 many | |0 years | ; to |0 see | |1 these | |0 little | |0 ones | |0 breaks | |1 the | |0 heart | .
"|1 The | |0 urge | to |0 protect | |1 and | |0 gather | them |1 all | |0 in | |1 is | |0 almost | |0 overwhelming | , |1 and | |0 makes | me |0 more | |0 grateful | |1 for | |1 the | |0 blessings | I |0 have | ."

What |1 do | |1 the | |0 new | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |0 videotape | |1 and | |0 audio | |0 speeches | |1 of | |0 Bin | |0 Laden | |1 and | |0 Ayman | |0 al | - |0 Zawahiri | |0 tell | us |1 about | |1 the | |0 hopes | |1 of | |1 the | |0 remaining | |0 top | |0 leadership | |1 of | |1 the | |0 organization | ?
"Because |1 the | |0 US | |1 and | |0 Pakistan | |1 have | |0 managed | to |0 capture | |1 or | |0 kill | |0 about | |1 2 | / |0 3s | |1 of | |1 the | |0 top | |1 25 | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |0 commanders | , |1 the | |0 middle | |0 managers | |1 are | not |1 in | |0 close | |0 contact | |1 with | |0 al | - |0 Zawahiri | |1 and | |0 Bin | |0 Laden | ."
|1 The | |0 tape | |1 was | |1 a | |0 way | to |0 signal | |0 priorities | .
"These |0 are | 1 ) |0 Assassinate | |1 or | |0 overthrow | |0 Gen. | |0 Pervez | |0 Musharraf | , |1 the | |0 Pakistani | |0 military | "" |0 president | "" who |1 had | |0 made | |1 a | |0 coup | |1 in | |1 1999 | |1 and | |1 has | |0 thrown | |0 in | his |0 lot | |1 with | |1 the | |0 United | |0 States | |1 against | |1 the | |0 Taliban | |1 and | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | ."
|0 Musharraf | |1 has | |1 been | |0 trying | to |0 purge | his |0 officer | |0 corps | |1 of | |1 the | |0 substantial | |0 number | |1 of | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |0 sympathizers | .
"His |0 military | |0 intelligence | |1 has | |0 captured | |0 major | |0 figures | |1 like | |0 Abu | |0 Zubayda | |1 and | |0 Khalid | |0 Shaykh | |0 Muhammad | , |0 as | |0 well | |1 as | |0 nearly | |1 500 | |0 other | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |0 operatives | , |0 over | |1 400 | |1 of | whom |1 the | |0 Pakistanis | |1 have | |0 turned | |1 over | |1 to | |1 the | |0 US | ."
"|0 Musharraf | |0 held | |0 elections | |1 in | |0 October | |1 of | |1 2002 | , |1 in | which |0 center | - |0 right | |0 parties | |0 did | |0 well | , |1 but | |1 in | which |0 nearly | |1 20 | |0 percent | |1 of | |0 parliament | |0 seats | |0 went | |1 to | |1 the | |0 fundamentalist | |0 religious | |0 party | |0 coalition | , |0 MMA | ."
"|0 MMA | |0 also | |0 captured | |1 the | |0 Northwest | |0 Frontier | |0 Province | , which |0 probably | |0 shelters | |0 Bin | |0 Laden | |1 and | |0 al | - |0 Zawahiri | , |1 and | |1 is | |1 in | |1 a | |0 joint | |0 government | |1 of | |0 Baluchistan | |0 Province | , |0 also | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Afghanistan | |0 border | ."
"If |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |1 can | |0 kill | |0 Musharraf | |1 or | |0 instigate | |1 a | |0 military | |0 coup | |1 against | him |1 by | |0 Islamist | |0 junior | |0 officers | , they |1 can | |0 hope | to |0 catapult | |1 the | |0 MMA | |1 to | |0 power | |1 as | |0 political | |0 allies | |1 and | |0 hosts | ."
"They |1 would | |0 thereby | |0 gain | |0 control | |1 of | |1 a | |0 major | |0 base | |1 for | |0 terrorist | |0 operations | , which |1 is | |0 also | |1 a | |0 nuclear | |0 power | ."
"|1 All | |1 this | |1 is | |0 highly | |0 unlikely | , |1 as | |1 with | |0 most | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |0 crackpot | |0 schemes | ."
|1 But | |0 so | |1 was | it |0 unlikely | that |1 a | |0 small | |0 group | |1 of | |0 Arab | |0 mujahidin | |1 would | |0 virtually | |0 take | |1 over | |0 Afghanistan | .
|0 Response | : |1 The | |0 US | |1 must | |0 do | whatever it |1 can | to |0 strengthen | |1 the | |0 legitimacy | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Pakistani | |0 government | .
"|1 On | |1 the | |1 one | |0 hand | , it |1 should | |0 pressure | |0 Musharraf | to |0 take | |1 off | his |0 uniform | |1 and | |0 run | |1 for | |0 president | |1 in | |1 a | |0 fair | |0 election | , |1 and | to |0 repeal | |1 the | |0 contentious | "" |0 Legal | |0 Framework | |0 Order | "" that |0 essentially | |0 perpetuates | his |0 dictatorship | ."
"|1 On | |1 the | |0 other | , |0 restrictions | |1 should | |1 be | |0 lifted | |1 on | |1 the | |0 mainstream | |0 Muslim | |0 League | - |0 N | |1 and | |0 Pakistan | |0 People | 's |0 Party | , who |1 can | |0 defeat | |1 the | |0 MMA | |1 in | |0 fair | |0 elections | if |0 not | |0 hogtied | |1 by | |1 the | |0 secret | |0 police | ."
"|1 On | |1 the | |0 other | |0 hand | , |1 the | |0 US | |1 should | |0 strong | - |0 arm | |0 India | |1 and | |0 Pakistan | |1 into | |1 a | |0 final | |0 settlement | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Kashmir | |0 issue | ."
|0 Al | - |0 Zawahiri | |0 attempted | to |0 use | |0 Musharraf | 's |0 lack | |1 of | |0 progress | in |0 helping | |1 the | |0 Muslims | |1 of | |1 that | |0 Indian | |0 state | |1 as | |1 a | |0 justification | |1 for | his |0 overthrow | .
"|1 The | |0 Kashmir | |0 issue | |0 generates | |0 far | |0 more | |0 terrorism | , |1 and | |0 even | |1 the | |0 threat | |1 of | |0 nuclear | |0 war | , than |0 Iraq | |0 ever | |0 did | ."
2 ) |0 Target | |0 Israel | |1 and | |0 encourage | |1 the | |0 worst | |0 elements | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Palestinians | by |0 playing | |1 on | |1 the | |0 iron | |0 fist | |0 policies | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Sharon | |0 government | .
"|0 Response | : |1 The | |0 US | |1 has | |0 succeeded | in |0 politically | |0 isolating | |0 Hamas | , |1 and | |0 started | |1 the | |0 process | of |0 cutting | |1 off | its |0 funding | ."
|1 This | |0 terrorist | |0 organization | |1 can | |0 now | |0 only | |0 pull | |1 off | |0 far | |0 less | |0 sophisticated | |0 bombings | |1 and | |0 attacks | .
It |1 should | |0 continue | to |1 be | |0 defanged | .
"|1 But | |0 Sharon | 's |0 iron | |0 fist | |1 is | |0 simply | not |0 working | |1 as | |1 a | |0 means | of |0 establishing | |0 general | |0 peace | , |1 and | |1 the | |0 Bush | |0 administration | |1 will | |0 have | to |0 finally | |0 apply | |0 effective | |0 pressure | |1 on | |0 Sharon | to |0 stop | his |0 outrages | |1 in | |1 and | |0 colonization | |1 of | |1 the | |0 West | |0 Bank | |1 and | |0 Gaza | ."
"|0 Sharon | 's |0 hard | |0 line | |1 has | |0 worked | |1 in | |0 tandem | |1 with | |0 Hamas | 's |0 terrorism | to |0 ratchet | |1 up | |0 tensions | |0 further | |1 and | |0 further | , which |0 spill | |0 over | |1 into | |1 the | |0 Muslim | |0 world | |1 and | |0 serve | |1 as | |1 a | |0 recruiting | |0 tool | |1 for | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |1 in | its |0 search | |1 for | |0 agents | |0 willing | to |0 hit | |1 the | |0 United | |0 States | ."
"|0 Israel | |0 owes | |1 the | |0 United | |0 States | |0 at | |0 least | |0 this | |0 much | , |1 in | |1 this | |0 crisis | , to |0 cease | |0 militarily | |0 unnecessary | |0 provocations | |1 and | |0 establish | |0 genuine | |0 peace | ."
"3 ) |0 Make | |0 Iraq | |1 another | |0 Afghanistan | , |0 using | |1 the | |0 Republican | |0 Right | 's |0 own | |0 tactics | |1 against | them ."
"|0 Response | : |0 Iraq | |1 is | |0 actually | |0 hostile | |0 territory | |1 for | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | , |1 and | |1 without | |0 Iraqi | |0 sympathizers | it |1 can | not |0 succeed | |0 there | ."
"By |0 moving | |0 quickly | |1 to | |0 Iraqi | |0 sovereignty | |1 and | |0 improvement | |1 of | |0 Iraqi | |0 lives | , |1 the | |0 US | |1 may | |1 be | |0 able | to |0 get | |0 Iraqis | |1 on | its |0 side | , so that they |0 turn | |1 in | |1 the | |0 foreigners | ."
"|0 Certainly | , |1 the | |0 Shiites | |0 already | |0 hate | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |1 and | |1 would | |0 help | ; |0 likewise | |1 the | |0 Kurds | ."
"|1 The | |0 problem | of |0 mollifying | |1 the | |0 Sunnis | , |0 though | , |0 has | to |1 be | |0 solved | to |0 avoid | |0 giving | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |1 an | |0 entrée | ."
|1 The | |0 Americans | |0 have | to |0 put | |0 away | their |0 free | - |0 market | |0 fetishism | |1 for | |1 a | |0 while | |1 and | |0 find | |0 ways | of |0 creating | |0 jobs | |1 and | |0 pumping | |0 money | |1 into | |0 Iraqi | |0 households | .
"We |0 need | |1 an | |0 FDR | |1 in | |0 Iraq | , |0 not | |1 a | |0 Ronald | |0 Reagan | ."
"|0 Of | |0 course | , |1 the | |0 sooner | |1 the | |0 US | |0 soldiers | |1 can | |1 be | |0 withdrawn | |1 in | |0 favor | |1 of | |0 less | - |0 provocative | |0 local | |1 or | |0 international | |0 forces | , |1 the | |0 better | ."
|0 Getting | |1 the | |0 Spanish | |1 out | |1 of | |0 Iraq | |1 is | n't |0 nearly | |0 as | |0 good | |1 a | |0 rallying | |0 cry | |1 for | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |1 in | |1 the | |0 Arab | |0 world | as |0 getting | |1 the | |0 Americans | |1 and | |0 British | |0 out | .
"|1 The | |0 thing | to |0 keep | |1 in | |0 mind | |0 is | that |0 Sunni | |0 Arab | |0 nationalists | |1 and | |0 Baathists | |1 and | |0 local | |0 Sunni | |0 radicals | |1 are | |0 likely | to |0 remain | |0 far | |0 more | |0 dangerous | |1 to | |1 the | |0 US | |1 in | |0 Iraq | |1 than | |0 al | - |0 Qaeda | |0 infiltrators | , |1 and | it |1 would | |1 be | |0 dangerous | to |0 take | one 's |0 eyes | |1 off | |1 the | |0 former | |0 ball | ."
|0 George | |0 W. | |0 Bush | |0 alleged | |0 Thursday | that |0 John | |0 Edwards | |0 lacks | |1 the | |0 experience | |0 necessary | to |1 be | |0 president | .
"|1 The | |0 problem | |1 with | |1 this | |0 argument | |0 is | that |0 Bush | |0 lacked | |1 the | |0 experience | |0 necessary | to |1 be | |0 president | |0 when | he |0 ran | |1 in | |1 2000 | , |0 so | |1 this | |0 sort | |1 of | |0 cheap | |0 shot | |0 just | |0 hoists | him |1 by | his |0 own | |0 petard | ."

"After |0 asking | me |1 which | |0 tribe | I |0 belong | |1 to | ( |0 thus | |0 assessing | my |0 sectarian | |0 background | ) he |0 started | |0 hurling | |0 abuses | |1 at | |1 the | |0 Shia | , |0 calling | them |0 Persians | , |0 Majoos | ( |0 fire | |0 worshippers | ) , |0 rabid | |0 dogs | |1 and | |1 a | |0 handful | |1 of | |0 other | |0 descriptions | that I |1 ca | n't |0 mention | |0 here | ."
He |0 described | |0 Allawi | 's |0 face | |1 as | that |1 of | |1 a | |0 f*ed | |0 horse | |1 and | he |0 dismissed | |1 the | |0 whole | |0 government | |1 as | |1 a | |0 band | |1 of | |0 thieves | |1 and | |0 traitors | .

|0 Sunni | |0 Iraqis | |0 contend | that |0 elections | |1 are | |0 impossible | to |0 hold | |1 under | |0 occupation | .

I |0 had | |1 another | |0 conversation | |1 some | |0 months | |0 ago | |1 with | |1 a | |0 retired | |0 Ba'athist | |0 old | - |0 timer | who |0 claimed | that |0 Ba'athists | |0 have | |1 the | |0 means | to |0 stage | |1 a | |0 third | |0 coup | |0 d'etat | |1 and | |0 return | |1 to | |0 power | |1 within | |1 10 | |0 hours | |1 of | |1 an | |0 American | |0 withdrawal | .
"On |0 sensing | my |0 incredulity | |1 to | his |0 statement | he |0 asserted | that |0 Ba'athist | |0 cells | |0 exist | |1 in | |1 all | |0 parts | |1 of | |1 the | |0 country | |1 and | that they |1 do | |0 have | |1 a | |0 central | |0 command | , |0 even | though |0 many | |1 have | |0 formed | |0 seperate | |0 cells | ( |0 often | |1 under | |0 Islamic | |0 labels | ) |1 with | their |0 own | |0 leaderships | ."
He |0 said | that they |0 have | |1 the | |0 training | |1 and | |1 the | |0 funding | |0 as | |0 well | |1 as | |1 the | |0 support | |1 of | |0 neighbouring | |1 and | |0 regional | |0 governments | .
"I |0 concur | that |0 Ba'athists | |1 and | |0 former | |0 security | |0 forces | |1 are | |0 capable | of |0 immediately | |0 controlling | |0 at | |0 least | |1 5 | |1 out | |1 of | |1 18 | |0 governorates | , |1 along | |1 with | |1 the | |0 capital | , if |0 Americans | |0 are | to |1 be | |0 removed | |1 from | |1 the | |0 picture | |0 entirely | ."
"|1 But | I |0 also | |0 see | that |1 as | |1 a | |0 fatal | |0 misconception | , which |1 is | |0 doing | |0 Sunnis | |0 harm | , because I |1 do | n't |0 believe | |1 the | |0 US | |1 is | |0 going | |0 anywhere | |0 so | |0 soon | ."
"|1 Any | |0 government | that |0 assumes | |0 power | |1 after | |1 the | |0 elections | |0 also | |0 realises | this , |0 so | |0 not | |0 even | |0 Sistani | |1 is | |0 going | to |0 call | |1 the | |0 US | to |0 withdraw | its |0 troops | , despite what he |1 is | |0 saying | |0 now | , not until they |1 are | |0 ensured | |1 the | |0 insurgency | |1 is | |1 out | |1 of | |1 the | |0 picture | , |1 or | that they |0 have | |1 an | |0 alternative | |0 foreign | |0 power | ( |1 in | |1 this | |0 case | |0 Iran | ) to |0 back | them |1 up | ."
"|1 The | |0 only | |0 hope | |0 now | |0 is | that , |0 following | |1 the | |0 elections | , |1 the | |0 National | |0 Assembly | |1 would | |0 offer | |1 the | |0 hand | |1 of | |0 peace | |1 and | |0 reconciliation | |1 to | |1 the | |0 dissenting | |0 parties | ."
"I |1 would | |0 suggest | |0 going | |1 for | |0 tribal | |0 Sheikhs | |1 rather | |1 than | |0 clerics | , since they |0 have | |1 the | |0 upper | |0 hand | |1 in | their |0 areas | |1 and | |1 can | |0 effectively | |0 root | |1 out | |1 any | |0 Ba'athists | |1 in | their |0 midst | |1 in | |0 return | |1 for | |1 a | |0 promise | of |0 sharing | |0 power | |1 and | |0 authority | ."

"I |0 understand | |1 all | |1 of | |1 those | |0 comparisons | , |0 however | , |1 the | |0 reality | |0 is | if we |0 lose | |0 Dean | ( which we |1 will | if we |1 do | n't |0 pay | |1 65 | |1 k | + |1 10 | |1 k | ) , we |1 will | |0 end | |1 up | |0 hiring | |1 a | |0 replacement | |1 at | |1 75 | - |1 80 | |0 k | ."

|0 Juan | |0 communicated | |1 some | |0 numbers | |1 to | me |1 and | |0 when | |0 reviewing | |1 this | |0 request | |1 would | |0 like | to |0 ask | you to |0 consider | |1 the | |0 following | :
"|0 Current | |0 Salary | : $ |1 47,500 |"
|0 Job | |0 Group | : |0 Specialist |
|0 YE | |0 PRC | |0 Rating | : |0 Satisfactory |
|0 Original | |0 Proposition | :

|0 Revised | |0 Proposal | :
|0 Base | |0 Salary | : |1 55 | |1 k |
|1 1 | |0 Year | |0 agreement |
"$ |1 5,000 | |0 signing |"
"|0 Business | |0 Case | : If we |0 offered | |0 Dean | |1 55 | |1 k | |1 or | |1 60 | |1 k | it |1 would | |0 still | |0 constitute | |1 a | |1 over | |1 a | $ |1 10,000 | |0 increase | ( |0 approximately | |1 25 | % ) |1 and | |0 taking | |1 into | |0 consideration | he |1 was | |0 rated | |1 as | |0 satisfactory | |1 at | |1 the | |0 specialist | |0 level | ."
"|0 Also | , |1 the | |0 top | |1 of | |1 the | |0 salary | |0 range | |1 for | |1 a | |0 specialist | |1 is | |1 66 | |0 k | ."
It |1 would | |0 still | |0 give | him |0 room | to |0 progress | |1 in | |1 the | |0 current | |0 job | |0 group | |1 should | he not |1 be | |0 promoted | .
"|0 Secondly | , he |1 will | |0 still | out |0 price | |0 performers | that you |0 have | |1 in | |1 the | |0 same | |0 job | |0 group | that |1 are | |0 excellent | |1 and | |0 strong | |0 performers | |0 respectively | eg. |0 Paul | |0 Thomas | , |0 Jason | |0 Choate | , |0 Todd | |0 DeCook | |1 and | |0 Peter | |0 Makkai | ."

They |1 should | |1 be | |0 delivered | |1 this | |0 week | .
They |1 are | |0 beautiful | |1 and | |1 will | |0 add | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 to | our |0 collection | .
|1 By | |1 the | |0 way | |1 the | |0 Lichtenstein | |0 is | |0 up | |1 and | |0 hanging | |1 in | our |0 formal | |0 living | |0 room | |1 and | it |1 is | |0 magnificent | .
I |1 have | |0 also | |0 purchased | |1 an | |0 Appel | |1 in | |1 the | |0 last | |0 month | .
I |1 am | |0 interested | |1 in | |0 several | |0 artists | .
"|0 Actually | , |1 a | |0 lot | ."
I |1 will | |1 be | |0 looking | |1 for | |1 one | |1 or | |0 more | |1 of | |1 the | |0 following | .
My |0 concept | |0 is | that |1 over | |0 time | I |1 would | |0 like | to |0 own | |1 one | |1 of | |1 all | |1 the | |0 following | |0 artists | |1 and | they |1 are | |0 all | |0 depending | |0 when | I |0 find | something that we |0 really | |0 like | .
I |0 listed | |1 all | |1 of | our ( |0 sometimes | mine |1 vs. | my |0 wife | 's |0 favorites | |1 and | |0 priorities | ) .
They |1 are | |0 kind | |0 of | |1 in | |0 rank | |0 order | |1 but | as I |0 stated | if I |0 find | |1 the | |0 piece | that I |0 like | we |1 will | |0 purchase | it .
I |0 want | |0 signed | |1 and | |0 numbered | .
I |0 realize | that |1 some | |1 were | not |0 signed | |1 by | |1 the | |0 artist | |1 but | it |1 is | |1 an | |0 important | |0 fact | |1 in | my |0 buying | |0 decision | .
I |0 also | |0 realize | that |1 some | |1 may | not |1 have | |0 done | |1 any | |0 works | |1 on | |0 paper | |1 or | they |1 are | |0 outrageously | |0 expensive | .
"|1 For | |0 example | , I |1 would | |0 like | to |0 know | if |0 Rothko | |1 or | |0 Kline | |0 did | |1 any | |0 work | |1 on | |0 paper | ."
|0 At | |0 least | that |1 is | what I |1 am | |0 thinking | |0 now | .
|0 Bonnard | ( |0 colorful | |0 only | )
|0 Lautrec |
|0 Suerat | ( |1 any | |0 works | |1 on | |0 paper | ? -
I |1 do | n't |0 know | that he |0 did | |1 any | )
|0 Other | |0 impressionist | |1 or | post |0 impressionist | |0 lithos |
|0 Braque |
|0 Moore |
|0 Arp |
|0 Rouault |
|0 Modrian |
|0 Rothko |
|0 Kline |
|0 Motherwell |
"|1 By | |1 the | |0 way | , I |1 am | |0 interested | in |0 re-looking | |1 at | |1 a | |0 Picasso | ( although we |0 have | |1 2 | ) that your |0 gallery | |0 had | |1 a | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 years | |0 ago | ."
"It |1 was | |1 a | |0 cubist | |0 piece | |1 from | |1 the | |0 1920s | |1 and | I |0 believe | you |0 called | |1 the | |0 technique | |1 a | "" |0 push | |0 wa | "" ( |0 pronunciation | |1 Vs | |1 an | |0 attempt | |1 at | |1 the | |0 proper | |0 spelling | ) ."
"It |1 was | |1 for | |0 sale | |1 in | |1 a | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 galleries | |1 in | |0 SF | |1 and | |1 was | |0 about | $ |1 20,000 | ."
|0 Is | there |1 1 | |0 available | ?
"|0 Also | I |1 am | |0 still | |0 thinking | |1 about | |1 the | |0 Matisse | we |0 discussed | |0 before | |1 but | as you |1 can | |0 see | , I |0 have | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | |0 other | |0 artists | I |1 am | |0 interested | |1 in | |1 and | it |1 may | |0 remain | |1 on | |1 the | |0 back | |0 burner | because we |0 already | |0 have | |1 one | ."

"1 . |1 The | |0 pricing | that we |1 have | |0 given | |0 CRRA | |1 is | |0 specific | |1 to | |0 FuelCell | |0 Energy | |1 and | |1 would | not |1 be | |0 meaningful | without |0 listing | |1 the | |0 manufacturer | ( i.e. , |0 ONSI | |1 would | |1 be | |1 a | |0 lot | |0 more | |0 money | ) ."

"|1 In | my |0 opinion | , we |1 should | |0 show | |0 CRRA | |1 a | |0 copy | |1 of | |1 the | |0 LOI | |1 with | |1 the | |0 assumption | that |1 the | |0 Development | |0 Agreement | |1 is | |0 attached | ."

3 . I |0 expect | |0 at | |0 least | |1 one | |0 EPC | |0 contract | |1 per | |0 project | .
We |1 do | n't |0 want | to |0 condition | |1 the | |0 acceptance | |1 of | |1 one | |0 project | |1 on | |1 the | |0 performance | |1 of | |1 another | |0 project | .

|0 Off | |1 and | |0 on | ( |1 with | |0 Jackie | |0 Gentle | 's |0 help | ) I |1 have | |0 pulled | |0 together | |1 a | |1 one | |0 page | |0 communication | |0 note | |1 on | our |0 fundamental | |0 operating | |0 standards | ( itself |1 a | |1 one | |0 page | |0 summary | ) .
We |1 are | |1 in | |1 the | |0 final | |0 stages | |1 of | |1 this | |0 process | - |0 where | we |0 draft | |1 a | |0 cover | |0 letter | |1 for | |0 John | which |1 will | |0 introduce | this |1 for | |0 inclusion | |1 within | |0 Globalflash | ( |1 the | |0 Enron | |0 Europe | |0 newsletter | )
|0 Have | you |1 any | |0 thoughts | |1 on | |0 draft | |1 or | |0 cover | |0 note | ?

|0 Late | |0 Jan | |0 sounds | |0 great | .
"|0 Meagan | |1 does | |0 have | |1 a | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 big | |0 things | |1 on | |1 the | |0 weekend | |1 in | |0 January | -- |0 National | |0 Charity | |0 League | |0 Senior | |0 Presentation | ( |0 big | |0 dance | that she |1 and | I |1 are | |0 committed | to |0 help | |1 with | ) , |1 the | |0 Bearkadette | |0 Ball | |1 and | |1 a | |0 winter | |0 party | |1 for | |0 Cotillion | ."
"I |0 believe | that these |1 are | |1 three | |0 weekends | |1 in | |1 a | |0 row | , |0 January | |1 6 | , |1 13 | |1 and | |0 20th | ."
|0 So | |1 the | |0 last | |0 weekend | |1 in | |0 January | |1 would | |0 work | |0 well | ( |1 and | I |1 will | |0 need | |1 a | |0 rest | |1 from | |0 formal | |0 affairs | ! ) .
|1 Does | that |0 work | |1 for | you ?
|1 And | |1 do | you |0 want | to |0 do | it |1 on | |1 a | |0 Saturday | |1 or | |0 Sunday | ?
"|0 Saturday | |0 probably | |0 works | |0 better | |1 for | me , |0 just | so that I |0 am | |0 back | |1 in | |0 Houston | |1 and | |0 doing | |0 laundry | |1 by | |0 Sunday | |0 afternoon | !!"
|0 Hi | ...
|0 Talked | |1 to | |1 the | |0 little | |0 mother | - |0 to | - |0 be | .
She |0 said | |1 a | |0 shower | |1 would | |1 be | |0 grand | .
She |0 has | |1 some | |0 big | |0 presentation | |0 mid-January | .
|0 How | |1 does | |0 late | |0 January | |0 sound | |1 to | you .
|1 Should | we |0 set | |1 a | |0 date | |0 now | ?
|1 Am | I |0 turning | |1 into | |0 Mother | ?

"I |0 think | that it |1 is | |1 a | |0 great | |0 idea | to |0 get | |1 some | |0 press | |0 regarding | our |0 fundamental | |0 operating | |0 standards | , |1 but | I |0 wonder | |1 about | |1 the | |0 most | |0 appropriate | |0 timing | , |0 enough | |1 of | |1 a | |0 global | |0 message | |1 and | |1 the | |0 means | |1 of | |0 delivery | ."
"|1 On | |1 the | |0 means | |1 of | |0 delivery | , I |1 am | not |0 sure | |1 from | your |0 note | whether |1 or | |0 not | I |0 fully | |0 understand | |1 the | |0 intent | ."
"|0 Is | there |1 an | |0 article | to |1 be | |0 included | |1 in | |1 an | |0 Enron | |0 publication | |1 and | |1 in | |0 addition | |0 is | |1 a | |0 letter | to |1 be | |0 sent | |1 under | |0 John | 's |0 name | ( if |0 so | , |1 to | whom |1 will | |1 the | |0 letter | |1 be | |0 sent | ) ?"
|1 Or | |1 is | |1 the | |0 letter | |1 from | |0 John | |1 an | |0 introduction | to |1 be | |0 included | |1 as | |1 a | |0 lead | |0 in | |1 to | |1 the | |0 article | ?
"|1 With | |0 regard | |1 to | |1 a | |0 global | |0 message | , I |0 think | that |1 one | |1 of | |1 the | |0 key | |0 points | |1 around | |0 fundamental | |0 operating | |0 standards | |0 are | that they |1 are | |0 intended | to |1 be | |0 global | |1 in | |0 nature | , |0 applied | |1 to | |1 every | |0 commodity | |1 and | |1 every | |0 location | |0 where | we |0 engage | |1 in | |0 trading | |0 activities | ."
"With |1 these | |0 operating | |0 standards | |0 implemented | |0 worldwide | , we |1 will | |0 know | |1 as | |0 operations | |0 professionals | that |0 risk | |1 is | |1 being | |0 mitigated | |1 and | we |1 will | |1 be | |0 able | to |0 ensure | |0 Enron | |0 top | |0 management | that there |0 is | |0 consistency | |1 in | |0 operating | |0 standards | |0 worldwide | ."
"|1 These | |0 global | |0 standards | |0 also | |1 should | |0 enable | |0 Enron | to |0 expand | its |0 business | |0 reach | |0 more | |0 quickly | , |1 with | |0 well | |0 defined | |0 requirements | |1 with | |0 regard | |1 to | |0 trading | |0 operations | ."
I |1 am | not |0 sure | |1 from | |1 the | |0 article | as |0 written | that |1 the | |0 global | |0 nature | |1 of | |1 this | |0 effort | |0 comes | |0 across | .
"|0 Finally | , |1 a | |0 question | |0 regarding | |0 timing | ."
|1 The | |0 last | I |0 knew | after you |1 and | |0 Brent | |0 drafted | |1 this | |0 starting | |0 point | |1 for | |0 fundamental | |0 operating | |0 standards | |0 was | that this |1 was | |1 being | |0 circulated | ( |0 Shona | |0 took | this to |0 do | |1 after | |0 Brent | 's |0 return | |1 to | |0 Houston | ) |1 for | |0 comments | |1 to | |1 all | |0 business | |0 controllers | .
"I |1 do | n't |0 believe | that we |1 are | |0 quite | |1 at | |1 the | |0 point | |0 that | we |1 can | |0 say | that |1 all | |0 business | |0 controllers | |0 worldwide | |1 have | |0 reviewed | , |0 understand | |1 and | |1 have | |0 implemented | |1 these | |0 standards | ."
"|1 And | |0 not | to |0 belittle | |1 the | |0 process | of |0 creating | |1 the | |0 standards | , |1 the | |0 tough | |0 part | ( |1 and | |1 the | |0 real | |0 meat | |1 behind | this ) |1 will | |1 be | |1 an | |0 effective | |0 exception | |0 report | |1 on | |1 a | |0 global | |0 basis | |1 against | |1 these | |0 standards | ."
My |0 commitment | |1 to | |0 Rick | |0 Causey | |1 is | that I |1 will | |0 have | |1 that | |0 global | |0 report | |1 in | |0 production | |1 by | |1 the | |0 end | |1 of | |1 the | |0 year | .
There |0 is | |0 much | |0 work | to |0 do | in |0 defining | |1 the | |0 content | |1 and | |0 regularity | |1 of | |1 the | |0 report | |1 and | |0 even | |0 more | |0 work | to |0 do | to |0 identify | |0 reliable | |0 sources | |1 of | |0 data | for |0 compiling | |1 the | |0 report | .
"|0 Shona | |1 has | |0 commissioned | |0 Mike | |0 Moscoso | to |0 work | |1 on | this , |1 and | I |0 believe | that |0 Mike | |1 has | |0 already | |1 been | |0 working | |1 with | |0 James | |0 New | ."
|0 So | I |0 question | whether |1 or | |0 not | you |0 want | to |0 publish | |0 info | |1 about | |0 fundamental | |0 standards | that we |1 can | not |0 yet | |0 report | |1 against | .
|1 Would | |1 a | |0 more | |0 appropriate | |0 time | |1 be | |1 after | |1 the | |0 Global | |0 Operations | |0 Controller | |0 meeting | |1 in | |0 October | |0 when | we |1 should | |0 have | |0 worldwide | |0 buy | - |0 in | |1 and | |0 commitment | |1 to | |1 these | |0 standards | |1 and | ( |0 hopefully | ) our |0 first | |0 draft | |1 of | |1 a | |0 meaningful | |0 exception | |0 report | ?
|0 Sorry | that |1 this | |0 response | |0 looks | |0 so | |0 long | .
"I |1 have | |1 been | |0 interrupted | |1 20 | |0 times | while |0 responding | , |0 so | I |0 hope | that it |0 makes | |0 sense | ."
|0 Thanks | for |0 sharing | this |1 with | me .
"Since you |0 asked | |1 for | |0 input | , I |0 hope | that you |1 do | n't |0 mind | that I |0 gave | you |1 some | ."

"|1 At | |1 this | |0 point | , our |0 IT | |0 contacts | |1 are | |0 backpedalling | |1 a | |0 bit | |1 and | |0 suggesting | they |1 can | |0 overcome | |1 the | |0 TIBCO | |1 and | |0 Terminal | |0 Server | |0 problems | ."
"There |0 are | |0 still | |1 four | |0 important | |0 issues | , |0 however | :"
|0 IT | |0 still | |1 can | not |0 commit | to |0 transferring | |0 messages | |1 across | |0 domains | .
This |0 means | that |0 messages | |0 initiated | |1 at | |0 Corp | |1 and | |0 intended | |1 for | |1 the | |0 entire | |0 Enron | |0 organization | |1 will | not |0 reach | |1 any | |0 business | |0 units | |1 outside | |1 the | |0 Corp | |0 domain | .
"|1 No | |0 messages | |1 will | |0 reach | |1 the | |0 EES | |0 organization | unless |0 IBM | |0 agrees | |0 not | to |0 use | their |0 proprietary | |0 message | |0 delivery | |0 tool | , |0 WebSphere | , |1 and | |1 will | |0 use | |0 WebLogic | |0 instead | ."
"|0 WebLogic | |1 is | |0 required | |1 by | |0 BackWeb | , although it |1 is | |0 designed | |1 by | |1 a | |0 separate | |0 company | ."
"|0 HR | , |0 intended | to |1 be | |1 a | |0 key | |0 user | |1 of | |1 this | |0 tool | , |1 will | not |0 use | |0 BackWeb | because |0 survey | |0 responses | |1 can | not |1 be | |0 made | |0 anonymous | ."
|0 HR | |1 has | |0 already | |0 purchased | |1 a | |0 tool | |0 called | |0 CONFIRMIT | that |1 can | |0 execute | |0 anonymous | |0 surveys | .
"|0 Messages | |1 will | not |1 be | |0 delivered | |0 simultaneously | |1 to | |1 all | |0 users | |1 in | |1 the | |0 same | |0 domain | , |1 nor | |1 will | they |1 be | |0 delivered | |1 for | |1 two | |1 to | |1 five | |0 hours | after they |1 are | |0 sent | |1 by | |1 the | |0 message | |0 administrator | ."
"|1 Another | |0 thing | to |0 consider | |0 is | that |1 these | |0 messages | |1 will | |1 be | |0 set | to |0 expire | |1 and | |0 disappear | |1 within | |1 a | |0 set | |0 period | |1 of | |0 time | , |0 meaning | |0 users | |1 can | not |0 retrieve | them |1 and | |0 read | them |0 later | ( as they |1 can | |1 with | |0 e-mail | ) ."
"This |0 means | that I |1 could | |1 be | |0 away | |1 from | |1 the | |0 office | |1 for | |0 several | |0 days | |1 and | |0 miss | |1 a | |0 message | |0 entirely | , because it |1 would | |1 have | |0 expired | |1 and | |0 disappeared | |1 by | |1 the | |0 time | I |0 returned | ."
"|1 The | |0 plain | |0 fact | |0 is | that |1 a | |0 few | |0 members | |1 of | |0 IT | |1 are | |0 pushing | |1 this | |0 initiative | , |1 but | they |0 lack | |0 commercial | |0 sponsorship | ."
They |1 are | |0 hoping | |0 Corp | |1 will | |0 foot | |1 the | |0 bill | |1 for | |1 a | |0 pilot | which |1 will | |0 allow | them to |0 fully | |0 test | |1 this | |0 tool | before |0 implementing | it |0 company | - |0 wide | .
|0 Please | |0 let | us |0 know | if you |0 have | |0 additional | |0 questions | .

|0 Currently | |0 Cargill | |1 and | |0 Enron | |0 have | |1 a | |1 15 | |1 MM | |0 collateral | |0 threshold | .
"If |0 possible | , I |0 think | |1 the | |0 cleanest | |0 way | to |0 run | |1 this | |0 biz | |1 would | |0 be | to |0 put | |1 a | |0 box | |1 around | |1 the | |0 prime | |0 broker | |0 biz | ."
We |1 would | |0 still | |0 operate | |1 under | |1 the | |0 master | |0 isda | |1 but | |1 could | |0 set | |1 up | |1 a | |0 mutually | |0 agreeable | |0 credit | |0 support | |0 annex | |1 for | |1 this | |0 biz | .
"We |1 would | |0 still | |0 keep | |1 the | |1 20,000,000 | |0 line | |0 referenced | |1 in | |0 Schedule | |0 B | |1 of | |1 the | |0 POA | |0 agreement | ."
|1 The | |0 line | |1 in | |1 the | |0 POA | |1 is | |1 a | |0 seperate | |1 and | |0 distinct | |0 measure | |1 from | |1 the | |0 daily | |0 collateral | .
|1 The | |1 20 | |1 mill | |0 reflects | |0 gross | |0 exposure | .
|0 Let | me |0 know | if you |0 think | this |1 is | |0 reasonable | |1 and | |0 workable | .
"We |0 too | , |1 are | |0 open | |1 to | |0 suggestion | as |1 the | |0 Global | |1 and | |0 Enron | |0 relationships | |1 are | |0 very | |0 important | |1 and | |1 a | |0 high | |0 priority | |1 to | us ."

I |1 am | |0 going | to |0 find | |1 out | |0 how | |0 much | |0 line | we |0 currently | |0 have | |0 available | ... you |0 probably | |0 already | |0 have | this .
"We |1 should | |0 allocate | |1 a | |0 piece | |1 to | |0 Global | which |1 would | |0 solve | |1 the | |0 problem | |1 of | |0 other | |0 Cargill | |0 people | |0 using | |1 the | |0 line | , |0 putting | us |1 over | |1 the | |0 limit | , without me |0 knowing | ..."

we |1 will | not |0 go | |1 over | |0 Global | 's |0 piece | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Cargill | |0 line | ...

I |1 do | not |0 think | |1 the | |0 prior | |0 e-mail | |0 got | |0 through | |1 to | |0 Kay | .
|1 Are | |1 either | |1 of | you |0 familiar | |1 with | |1 this | |0 project | ?
We |1 have | |0 had | |1 no | |0 contact | |1 with | |1 the | |0 ENA | / |0 Enron | |0 Mexico | |0 commercial | |1 or | |0 legal | |0 people | |1 and | I |1 do | n't |0 want | to |0 bust | |1 any | |0 structuring | |0 goals | .
Our |0 project | |0 manager | ( |0 Scott | |0 Laidlaw | ) |1 and | |0 engineer | ( |0 Harry | |0 Okabayashi | ) |0 want | to |0 issue | |1 a | |0 tasking | |0 letter | to |0 procure | |0 engineering | |0 services | |1 on | |1 this | |0 project | to |0 support | |1 the | |0 ENA | |0 work | .
I |0 now | |0 understand | that someone |1 at | |0 ENA | / |0 Enron | |0 Mexico | / |0 Enron | |0 Wholesale | |1 has | |0 signed | |1 an | |0 EPC | |0 contract | |1 with | |0 ABB | |1 for | |1 this | |0 project | .

|0 Hello | |0 Janice | :
I |0 enjoyed | your |0 recent | |0 e-mail | |1 but | |1 was | |0 sorry | to |0 hear | |1 about | your |0 dad | .
It |0 sounds | as though his |0 health | |1 has | |0 deteriorated | |0 significantly | .
These |1 are | |0 always | |0 difficult | |0 times | .
"As I |0 watched | my |0 mother | |1 and | |0 father | 's |0 health | |0 deteriorate | |1 and | |0 ultimately | |0 watched | them |0 die | , it |1 is | |1 a | |0 very | |0 defining | |0 time | |1 in | our |0 lives | ."
|1 But | we |1 can | |1 be | |0 very | |0 thankful | to |0 have | |0 such | |0 great | |0 parents | |1 and | to |1 have | |0 had | |1 the | |0 privilege | to |1 have | |1 been | |0 raised | |1 in | |0 such | |0 loving | |0 homes | .
|0 Sounds | as though |0 Eric | |1 has | |0 done | |0 very | |0 well | |1 as | |0 SMSU | .
He |1 is | |0 joining | |1 an | |0 excellent | |0 company | .
I |1 am | |0 also | |0 delighted | to |0 hear | that he |1 will | |0 continue | his |0 education | |0 working | |1 toward | |1 an | |0 MBA | .
"As we |1 are | |0 living | |1 in | |1 an | |0 age | |0 where | |0 intellectual | |0 capital | |1 is | |0 so | |0 valuable | , it |1 is | |0 important | for |1 every | |0 young | |0 person | to |0 obtain | |1 the | |0 very | |0 best | |0 possible | |0 education | they |1 can | ."
"|1 As | |1 to | our |0 family | , |1 within | |1 the | |0 last | |1 ten | |0 days | our |0 youngest | |0 daughter | |0 Elizabeth | |1 was | |0 married | |1 to | |1 a | |0 young | |0 man | |1 from | |0 Buenos | |0 Aires | , |0 Argentina | ."
They |0 met | while they |1 were | |0 both | |0 working | |1 on | |1 a | |0 project | |1 as | |0 lawyers | |1 in | |0 Buenos | |0 Aires | .
"They |1 're | |0 currently | |1 on | their |0 honeymoon | |1 but | |0 shortly | after |0 returning | |1 will | |1 be | |0 moving | |1 from | |0 Buenos | |0 Aires | |1 to | |0 Miami | , |0 Florida | ."
|1 This | |0 past | |0 Thursday | |0 night | our |0 sixth | |0 grandchild | |1 was | |0 born | .
It |1 was | |0 born | |1 to | our |0 son | |0 David | |1 and | his |0 wife | |0 Courtney | .
"It |1 was | |1 a | |1 7 | |0 lb. | , |1 10 | |0 oz. | , |1 20 | |0 inch | |0 little | |0 boy | ."
|0 So | we |0 now | |0 have | |1 three | |0 grandsons | |1 and | |1 three | |0 granddaughters | |0 ranging | |1 from | |0 about | |1 2 | |0 years | - |1 4 | |0 months | |0 down | |1 to | |1 a | |0 few | |0 days | .
They |1 are | |1 a | |0 great | |0 deal | |1 of | |0 fun | .
We |1 are | |0 doing | |0 quite | |0 well | .
"I |1 am | |0 looking | |0 forward | to |0 seeing | |0 Ginger | "" |0 Rees | "" |0 Copeland | |0 when | she |0 comes | |1 to | |0 Houston | ."
I |1 would | |1 be | |0 delighted | to |0 arrange | |0 tickets | |1 for | you |1 and | your |0 family | |1 should | you |0 ever | |0 have | |0 occasion | to |0 visit | |0 Houston | .
I |0 hope | you |0 have | |1 a | |0 great | |0 summer | .
|0 Thank | you |1 for | your |0 recent | |0 request | for |0 Mr. | |0 Lay | to |0 speak | |1 at | your |0 conference | .

|1 Does | that |0 work | ?
|0 Kay |
It |1 was | |0 good | to |0 hear | |1 from | you !
We |0 had | |1 a | |0 nice | |0 Thanksgiving | |0 here | |0 too | .
"It |1 's | |0 funny | , because |0 usually | it |1 's | |0 just | me , |0 Mom | , |0 Craig | |1 and | |0 Danelia | , |1 and | |0 Danelia | |1 does | n't |0 really | |0 like | |0 roasted | |0 turkey | |1 or | |0 roast | |0 beef | ( not that she |1 would | |0 say | it |1 to | me ! ) , |0 so | there |0 is | not |0 just | |1 the | |0 same | |0 joy | |1 in | |0 cooking | it |1 would | |1 be | |0 elsewise | ."
It |1 was | |0 good | |0 having | |1 the | |0 girls | |0 down | .
"We |0 played | |1 a | |0 new | |0 version | |1 of | |0 Uno | |0 called | "" |0 African | |0 Uno | "" that |1 was | |0 complex | , |0 fast | |1 and | |1 at | |0 times | , |0 physically | |0 challenging | ."
It |1 's | not |1 for | |1 the | |0 meek | .
It |1 was | |0 incredible | |1 what | |1 a | |0 good | |0 player | |0 Alena | |1 was | .
She |0 had | her |0 cards | |0 memorized | |0 as | |0 well | |1 as | everyone |0 else | s ( |0 when | you |0 play | you |1 'll | |0 see | |0 why | you |1 can | |0 know | everyone |0 else | s |0 hands | ! ) .
I |0 expect | |0 Craig | |1 did | n't |0 want | |0 Mom | to |0 see | his |0 place | because it |1 was | |0 messy | .
"I |0 think | |0 compared | |1 to | my |0 house | , he |1 's | |0 embarrased | |1 about | his |0 apartment | ."
"|0 Then | , |0 also | , he |1 's | |0 got | |0 so | |0 much | |0 stuff | |1 in | |0 there | |0 right | |0 now | , that I |1 do | n't |0 know | |0 how | he |1 's | |0 going | to |0 fit | |0 baby | |0 stuff | ."
They |1 would | |0 only | |0 give | him |1 a | |1 6 | |0 month | |0 lease | |0 when | he |0 renewed | his |0 lease | |0 last | |0 month | because they |1 do | n't |0 want | |1 3 | |0 people | |1 in | |1 that | |0 small | |0 apartment | .
|0 So | he |1 's | |0 going | to |0 have | to |0 start | |0 looking | |1 for | |1 another | |0 place | .
|1 And | his |0 apartment | |1 is | |0 so | |0 run | |1 down | |1 down | I |1 'm | |0 afraid | |0 roaches | |1 might | |1 be | |0 crawling | |1 over | |1 the | |0 baby | .
I |0 guess | |0 Mom | |1 is | |0 going | to |0 come | |0 back | |0 down | |0 sometime | |1 in | |0 March | |1 or | |0 April | to |0 see | |1 the | |0 new | |0 baby | .
You |1 'll | |0 have | to |0 come | |0 visit | to |0 check | |1 out | my |0 new | |0 house | .
"|1 The | |0 upstairs | "" |0 guest | |0 suite | "" |1 is | |0 pretty | |0 neat | ."
"It |1 's | |0 got | its |0 own | |0 bathroom | |1 and | |0 tv | , |1 and | |1 is | |0 pretty | |0 cozy | ."
"|0 As | |0 far | as |1 the | |0 call | |1 with | |0 Uncle | |0 Ben | |0 goes | , if he |1 was | |0 thrilled | to |0 hear | |1 from | me I |1 could | n't |0 tell | |1 by | his |0 voice | ."
It |1 was | |1 a | |0 pretty | |0 stilted | |0 conversation | |1 for | |1 both | |1 of | us .
"|1 But | , I |0 guess | , it |1 's | |1 a | |0 start | ..."
I |1 've | |0 already | |0 made | my |0 XMAS | |0 plans | .
"I |0 leave | |1 the | |0 evening | |1 of | |1 the | |0 21st | , my |0 flight | |0 comes | |0 in | |1 about | |1 10 | |0 pm | , |1 and | |0 leave | |1 the | |0 morning | |1 of | |1 the | |0 27th | |1 at | |1 6 | |0 am | ."
It |1 's | |0 good | |0 chatting | |1 with | you .
|0 Keep | |1 in | |0 touch | !

"|1 But | , we |0 had | |1 a | |0 great | |0 laid | |0 back | |0 day | |0 last | |0 Saturday | |1 and | I |0 think | |1 have | |0 hit | |1 that | |0 comfortable | |0 stage | ... you |0 know | , not |0 quite | |0 so | |0 formal | |1 about | |0 dates | etc ."
"|1 In | |1 one | |0 sense | it |1 's | |0 great | , |1 but | it |0 also | |0 makes | |0 things | |1 a | |0 lot | |0 harder | to |0 read | ."

|1 The | |0 play | |0 was | |0 very | |0 good | |1 and | I |0 think | |0 well | |0 received | .
I |1 'd | |0 forgotten | |0 how | |0 blown | |0 away | I |1 was | |1 by | |1 some | |1 of | |1 the | |0 songs | |1 the | |0 first | |0 time | I |0 saw | it |1 in | |0 NY | .

"|0 Anyway | , I |1 'm | |0 sure | I |1 'd | |0 mentioned | it |0 before | |1 but | |0 yes | she |1 is | |1 a | |0 very | |0 smart | |0 girl | ."
"|1 As | |1 a | |0 result | |1 of | that , she |1 has | |0 managed | |1 on | |0 several | |0 occasions | |1 over | |1 the | |0 years | to |0 detract | |1 from | my |0 enjoyment | of |0 playing | |0 Trivial | |0 Pursuit | |1 or | |0 watching | |0 Jeopardy | by |0 absolutely | |0 obliterating | me ( |1 The | |0 girl | |0 actually | |0 did | her |0 senior | |0 thesis | |1 on | |0 Trivia | ) ."
|0 Kori | |0 told | me she |0 saw | you |0 last | |0 night | |1 at | |0 Steak | |0 Night | |1 and | |0 introduced | herself since I |0 failed | to |0 do | |0 so | |1 the | |0 last | |0 time | we |0 went | .
I |1 should | |0 let | you |0 know | |0 though | that she |1 was | |0 very | |0 offended | |1 this | |0 morning | that you |1 did | n't |0 spell | her |0 name | |0 right | |1 in | |1 the | |0 email | - I |0 mean | it |1 's | |1 such | |1 a | |0 common | |0 spelling | .
|0 So | |1 was | |0 Darren | |0 there | |0 last | |0 night | to |0 meet | her |1 or | |1 do | you |0 just | |0 think | they |1 'd | |0 make | |1 a | |0 good | |0 match | ?

|0 Hope | you |0 day | |1 is | |0 going | |0 well | |1 and | that |1 the | |0 move | |1 to | |1 30 | |0 went | |1 off | |1 without | |1 a | |0 hitch | .

|0 How | |1 was | |1 the | |0 play | ?
I |0 forgot | to |0 tell | you that I |0 saw | your |0 friend | |1 on | |1 a | |0 re-run | |0 Jeopardy | |1 the | |0 other | |0 night | |1 and | I |0 almost | |0 called | you |1 but | it |0 came | |0 on | |1 at | |1 11:30 | .
|0 Smart | |0 girl | .
I |0 ran | |1 into | |0 Corey | |0 last | |0 night | |1 at | |0 LW | s |1 and | I |1 am | |0 thinking | this |1 is | |1 a | |0 girl | |1 for | |0 Darren | .
"|0 Anyway | , |0 lots | |1 of | |0 fun | |0 meetings | |0 today | ."
I |1 'll | |0 talk | |1 to | you |0 later | .
|0 Maybe | you |1 should | |0 ignore | |1 the | |0 sentiment | |1 of | |1 the | |0 quote | I |0 sent | |0 earlier | ...
I |0 think | you |1 may | |1 be | |0 adhering | |1 to | it |0 too | |0 faithfully | .
|1 At | |1 this | |0 rate | we |1 may | |0 have | to |0 start | |0 pinning | |0 notes | |1 to | your |0 shirt | to |0 remind | you to |0 do | |0 things | .
"|0 However | , |1 having | |0 driven | |1 with | you |1 on | |0 several | |0 occasions | I |0 feel | |0 confident | you |1 will | |1 be | |0 able | to |0 pass | |1 the | |0 test | |1 with | |0 flying | |0 colors | ."
"|0 Keep | |1 in | |0 mind | |0 though | that if you |0 end | |1 up | |0 failing | I |1 will | not |0 let | you |0 forget | it ( |1 and | , as we |1 have | |0 established | , I |0 have | |1 the | |0 memory | |1 of | |1 an | |0 elephant | ) ."
I |1 'll | |0 keep | |0 discussion | |1 of | me |1 to | |1 a | |0 minimum | |1 and | |0 just | |0 say | that |0 things | |1 are | |0 well | |1 on | |1 32 | .
|0 Now | |0 back | |1 to | what |1 's | |0 really | |0 important | ... you .
|0 Thought | you |1 'd | |0 like | to |0 know | that |1 the | |0 Dixie | |0 Chicks | |1 are | |0 coming | |0 back | |1 to | |0 Houston | |0 Dec. | |1 12 | |1 and | |1 will | |0 performing | |0 just | |1 down | |1 the | |0 street | |1 from | you |1 at | |1 the | |0 Compaq | |0 Center | ... it |1 's | |0 all | |1 about | you |1 and | your |0 needs | .

This |1 is | |1 a | |1 two | |0 day | |0 process | |1 and | |0 all | because I |0 let | my |0 CA | |0 license | |0 expire | .
I |0 know | I |0 need | |1 some | |1 of | your |0 organizational | |0 skills | .
I |1 may | |0 try | to |0 run | |0 out | |1 and | |0 take | |1 the | |0 test | |1 this | |0 afternoon | while I |1 get | |0 moved | |1 to | |1 30 | ( I |0 better | |0 not | |0 fail | it ) .
|0 How | |1 's | |0 life | |1 on | |1 32 | |0 today | -- |0 well | that |1 's | |0 enough | |1 about | you |0 let | 's |0 talk | |0 more | |1 about | me .

"We |0 had | |1 a | |0 pretty | |0 good | |0 idea | |0 when | we |0 signed | |1 the | |0 contract | that |0 ECS | |1 would | not |1 be | |0 able | to |0 complete | that |1 by | |1 the | |0 contract | |0 start | |0 date | , |0 so | we |0 negotiated | |1 a | |0 fall | |0 back | |0 plan | |1 under | which |0 ECS | |1 is | |0 obligated | to "" |0 assist | [ |0 Transwestern | ] in |0 developing | |1 a | |0 manual | |0 system | to |0 accomplish | |1 the | |0 same | |0 result | |1 and | |1 will | |0 hold | |0 harmless | |1 and | |0 keep | [ |0 Transwestern | ] |0 whole | |1 for | |1 all | |0 cost | |1 and | |0 expenses | "" |0 associated | |1 with | |1 the | |0 manual | |0 system | ."

|1 Would | you |0 please | |0 contact | |0 Gerald | |0 Nemec | |1 and | |0 review | |1 the | |0 Gallup | |0 Compression | |0 Service | |0 Contract | |1 in | |0 respect | |1 to | |1 the | |0 Load | |0 Control | |0 Management | .
My |0 understanding | |0 was | that |0 ECS | |0 was | to |0 provide | |1 a | |0 means | to |0 access | |0 CDEC | 's |0 online | |0 profile | |1 in | |0 order | for us to |0 make | |1 a | |0 decision | to |0 avoid | |0 running | |1 the | |0 compressor | |1 during | |0 CDEC | 's |0 peak | |0 load | |0 periods | .
"We |1 have | not |0 received | |0 access | |1 to | |1 this | |0 information | which |1 has | |0 resulted | |0 so | |0 far | |1 in | |0 additional | |0 electric | |0 cost | |1 of | $ |1 200,987.33 | |1 for | |1 the | |0 period | |1 of | |0 July | |1 through | |0 September | ."
"|0 Additional | |0 cost | |1 will | |1 be | |0 incurred | |1 for | |1 the | |0 remainder | |1 of | |1 this | |0 year | , that I |1 have | not |1 been | |0 able | to |0 review | |0 yet | ."
"|1 This | |0 cost | |1 is | |0 averaging | $ |1 79,000 | |1 per | |0 month | if we |0 continue | to |0 run | |1 the | |0 compressor | as we |1 have | |1 in | |0 August | |1 and | |0 September | ."
"|0 Good | |0 point | , |1 but | I |1 'm | |0 comfortable | we |1 're | |0 covered | because our |0 bidders | |1 were | |0 all | |0 bidding | |1 on | |1 a | |0 chunk | |1 of | |0 capacity | |1 and | |0 primary | |0 points | ."
"They |1 are | |0 deemed | to |1 be | |1 on | |0 notice | that they |0 had | |0 alternate | |0 point | |0 rights | ( it |1 s | |1 in | |1 the | |0 tariff | ) |1 and | if they |0 wanted | to |0 submit | |1 a | |0 bid | that |0 had | |1 a | |0 different | |0 rate | |1 for | |0 primaries | |1 and | |0 alternates | , they |1 could | |1 have | |0 done | |0 so | ."
"|0 None | |1 of | them |0 did | , |1 and | |0 most | |0 importantly | , |1 the | |0 winning | |0 bidders | |0 did | not ."
Our |0 letter | |0 agreement | |0 simply | |0 memorializes | that we |1 will | |0 charge | |1 the | |0 same | |0 negotiated | |0 rate | whether |1 the | |0 gas | |0 flows | |1 on | |0 primaries | |1 or | |0 alternates | .
I |0 assume | |1 from | your |0 message | you |1 are | |0 OK | |1 with | this |1 and | they |1 can | |0 get | it |0 nailed | |0 down | ?
|0 DF |
I |0 just | |1 got | |0 done | |0 looking | |1 at | |1 the | |0 underlying | |0 contract | |0 language | as |0 set | |0 forth | |1 in | |1 the | pro forma |0 service | |0 agreement | |1 in | |1 the | |0 tariff | |1 and | it |0 specifically | |0 says | that |1 the | |0 max | |0 rate | |1 would | |0 apply | unless |1 a | |0 discount | |1 or | |0 negotiated | |0 rate | |1 has | |1 been | |0 agreed | |1 to | .
"My |0 concern | with |0 adding | |1 the | |0 language | |0 below | |0 is | , |1 could | it |1 be | |0 argued | that |0 not | everyone |0 knew | |1 the | |0 rate | |1 would | |1 or | |1 could | |0 apply | |1 at | |1 any | |0 point | , since we |0 just | |0 stated | |0 Topack | |1 and | |0 Needles | |1 and | if they |0 knew | they |1 might | |1 have | |0 bid | |1 a | |0 different | |0 rate | ??"

|0 Doug | |1 has | |1 been | |0 providing | us |1 with | |1 the | |0 necessary | |0 specific | |0 market | |0 information | .

"If |0 Sam | 's |0 description | |0 below | |1 of | |1 the | |0 GCP | |0 procedure | |1 is | |0 correct | , it |0 looks | |1 to | me like something |0 needs | to |1 be | |0 changed | ."
|1 The | |0 difficulty | |0 lies | |1 in | |1 the | |0 fact | that |1 the | |0 confirmation | |0 system | |0 reads | |1 the | |0 counterparty | 's |0 name | |1 from | |0 Global | |0 Counterparty | .
Since |0 divisions | |1 of | |0 companies | |1 are | not |0 legal | |0 entities | they |1 do | not |0 have | |1 the | |0 power | to |0 contract | |1 in | their |0 own | |0 names | .
"If |1 the | |0 correct | |0 legal | |0 name | |1 is | not |1 in | |0 Global | |0 Counterparty | , |1 the | |0 confirmation | |0 goes | |0 out | |1 with | |1 the | |0 wrong | |0 legal | |0 name | |1 on | it |0 seriously | |0 compromising | |1 the | |0 contract | itself ."
That |1 is | |1 the | |0 source | |1 of | |0 Tana | 's |0 concern | |0 regarding | |1 the | |0 correct | |0 entering | |1 of | |0 divisions | |1 in | |1 the | |0 system | .
My |0 suggestion | |0 is | that |0 Global | |0 Counterparty | |0 use | |1 the | |0 same | |0 name | that |1 the | |0 customer | |1 has | |0 signed | |1 on | |1 the | |0 EnronOnline | |0 Password | |0 Application | -- my |0 understanding | |0 is | that |1 the | |0 EnronOnline | |0 team | |0 returns | |0 inappropriate | |0 Applications | |1 to | |1 the | |0 customer | until they |1 are | |0 correctly | |0 completed | .
|1 In | |1 this | |0 particular | |0 case | since |1 the | |0 counterparty | |1 is | |0 still | not |0 allowed | to |0 transact | |1 on | |0 EnronOnline | |0 almost | |1 a | |0 month | after |0 sending | |0 in | their |0 application | they |1 are | |0 understandably | |0 upset | |1 and | |1 are | |0 now | |0 complaining | .
"I |1 would | |0 appreciate | it if you |1 could | |0 get | |1 this | |0 one | |0 fixed | |0 today | |1 and | , if you |0 have | |1 any | |0 problem | with |0 changing | |1 the | |0 GCP | |0 procedure | , |0 please | |0 let | me |0 know | ."

"|1 As | |1 an | |0 overview | , |1 this | |0 proposal | : * |0 Maintains | |1 the | |0 basic | |0 Gas | |0 Accord | |0 structure | |1 in | |0 place | |0 today | |1 for | |1 the | |0 period | |1 2003 | |1 to | |1 2007 | . *"

"|0 following | |1 up | |1 on | our |0 discussion | |0 yesterday | ; |1 for | |1 these | |0 types | |1 of | |0 deals | , i |1 do | nt |0 think | it |1 s | |0 necessary | to |0 have | |1 all | |1 the | |0 documentation | |1 of | our |0 counterparty | 's |0 authorization | to |0 enter | |1 into | |1 the | |0 agreement | ."
these |1 are | |0 short | |0 term | |0 transactions | |1 and | |0 requiring | |1 this | |0 documentation | |1 will | |0 cause | us to |0 lose | |0 business | because |0 competitive | |0 alternatives | |1 do | not |0 have | |0 such | |0 burdensome | |0 requirements | .
"|1 the | |0 primary | |0 reason | we |0 need | |1 these | |0 things | |1 is | |1 for | |1 the | |0 scenario | |0 where | |1 a | |0 muni | |0 does | |1 a | |0 derivative | |0 deal | |1 with | |1 an | |0 open | - |0 ended | |0 downside | , |0 loses | $ |1 50 | |1 million | , |1 and | |0 then | |0 claims | that it |1 was | not |1 a | |0 valid | |0 contract | ."
"|1 in | our |0 case | , they |1 are | |0 only | |0 hedging | ."
we |1 are | |0 collecting | |1 a | |0 premium | |1 up | |0 front | |1 and | their |0 total | |0 cost | |1 is | |0 known | |1 up | |0 front | .
|0 therefore | they |1 will | not |0 attempt | to |0 make | |1 this | |0 claim | .
"|0 even | if they |0 did | , our |0 risk | |1 is | |0 limited | |1 to | |1 the | |0 premium | , |0 not | |1 some | |0 big | |0 payout | ."
|1 the | |0 risk | of |0 losing | |0 business | |1 is | |0 far | |0 greater | |1 than | |1 the | |0 risk | |1 of | |1 a | |0 counterparty | |0 trying | to |0 get | their |0 premium | |1 back | .
|0 seems | |1 like | |1 a | |1 5 | |0 second | |0 decision | |1 to | me .
|1 is | it |0 possible | to |0 combine | |1 the | |0 standard | |0 isda | |1 and | our |0 confirm | |1 into | |1 a | |0 single | |0 long | |0 form | ?
by |0 going | |0 away | |1 from | |1 the | |0 standard | |0 isda | |0 maybe | we |1 can | |0 eliminate | |1 these | |0 requirements | because |1 the | |0 payout | |0 liability | |1 is | |0 only | |1 1 | - |0 way | .

I |0 told | |1 the | |0 bus | |0 driver | |0 where | to |0 drop | her |1 off | .
I |0 notified | her |0 grandmother | |1 with | |1 the | |0 time | |1 of | |1 the | |0 departure | .

I |1 have | |0 attempted | to |0 incorporate | |1 the | |0 changes | that |0 Jim | |1 has | |0 incorporated | |1 in | our |0 long | |0 form | |0 power | |0 agreement | which |0 ENA | |1 has | |0 suggested | |1 to | |0 date | |1 into | |1 the | |0 short | |0 form | .
|0 Attached | |0 please | |0 find | |1 a | |0 sample | |0 short | |0 form | ( |1 for | |1 the | |0 Con | |0 Ed | |0 market | ) |1 for | your |0 review | .
|0 Please | |0 note | |1 the | |0 following | as you |0 review | :
1 . |1 The | |0 short | |0 forms | |1 do | not |0 contain | |1 the | |0 optionality | |0 relating | to our |0 performing | |0 billing | |0 services | -- |1 all | |1 of | our |0 midmarket | |0 forms | |0 anticipate | that we |1 will | |0 act | |1 as | |0 customer | 's |0 billing | |0 agent | |1 and | that we |1 will | |0 collect | |1 all | |0 amounts | |0 due | |0 related | |1 to | |0 T&D | |1 and | |1 the | |0 like | |1 from | |1 the | |0 customer | ( |1 and | |0 reflect | |0 same | |1 on | our |0 invoice | ) |1 and | |0 pass | |1 those | |0 amounts | |0 on | |1 to | |1 the | |0 customer | 's |0 utility | .
"2 . I |1 did | not |0 include | |1 a | "" |0 Setoff | "" |0 provision | |1 in | |1 this | |0 draft | , |0 mainly | because |1 the | |0 vast | |0 majority | |1 of | |1 the | |0 time | , we |1 will | not , |1 nor | |1 will | |1 an | |0 affiliate | , |0 have | |1 another | |0 agreement | |1 in | |0 place | |1 with | |1 these | |0 customers | ."
"If you |0 feel | |0 strongly | about our |0 including | |1 a | |0 setoff | |0 provision | , we |1 will | |0 do | |0 so | ."
3 . |1 The | |0 change | |1 in | |0 law | |0 provision | |0 reads | |1 a | |0 bit | |0 differently | |1 from | |1 the | |0 long | |0 form | -- |1 the | |0 thinking | |0 here | |0 is | that |1 the | |0 long | |0 form | |0 language | |1 is | |0 very | |0 lengthy | |1 and | |0 rather | |0 harsh | ( |1 and | we |1 've | |0 had | |0 great | |0 difficulty | |0 selling | it |1 in | |1 the | |0 past | ) .
"|0 Taking | |1 into | |0 consideration | |1 this | |0 class | |1 of | |0 customer | , we |0 decided | to |0 include | |0 certain | |0 items | , |0 including | our |0 inability | to |0 cover | our |0 costs | |1 due | |1 to | |1 a | |0 change | |1 in | |0 law | , |0 rules | |1 or | |0 practices | |1 as | |1 a | "" |0 force | |0 majeure | |0 event | "" |1 in | |1 an | |0 effort | to |0 soften | |1 the | |0 approach | ( |0 see | |1 the | |0 GTCs | ) ."
"|0 Also | we |1 do | not |0 address | |0 calculation | |1 of | |1 a | |0 termination | |0 payment | |1 in | |1 the | |0 event | |1 of | |1 a | |0 change | |1 in | |0 law | as |1 the | |0 long | |0 form | |0 does | -- |0 again | , |0 more | |1 in | |1 the | |0 interest | of "" |0 saving | |0 space | "" |1 than | anything |0 else | ..."
|0 Let | us |0 know | your |0 thoughts | |1 on | |1 this | |0 document | |1 and | if you |1 are | |0 comfortable | with our |0 using | this |1 until | |0 such | |0 time | as |1 the | |0 hybrid | |0 form | |1 is | |0 launched | .
"If you |1 are | |0 comfortable | , we |1 will | |0 drive | |1 these | |0 changes | |1 into | our |0 other | |0 midmarket | |0 power | |0 forms | ."
"|0 Thanks | |0 again | |1 for | your |0 help | |1 with | |1 this | |0 project | ,"

"|0 P.S. | |0 Please | |1 be | |0 sure | to |0 copy | |0 Sarah | |0 Dietrich | |1 and | |0 Jennifer | |0 Hillegonds | |1 on | your |0 response | -- they |1 will | |1 be | |0 taking | |1 this | |0 project | |1 during | my "" |0 hiatus | "" -- I |1 am | |0 moving | |1 to | |0 PA | |1 on | |0 Friday | |1 of | |1 this | |0 week | , |1 and | |1 will | |1 be | |1 out | |1 of | |0 pocket | |1 through | |0 approximately | |1 7/16 | ."

I |0 think | |0 Valerie | |0 Mooney | ( our |0 credit | |0 person | ) |1 and | |0 Ed | |0 Sacks | |1 are | |0 still | |0 discussing | |1 some | |0 minor | |0 fine | |0 tuning | |1 of | |1 the | |0 LOC | |0 format | .
"I |0 spoke | |1 to | |0 Bob | |0 Bruce | |1 this | |0 morning | - we |1 're | |0 all | |0 set | |1 on | |1 the | |0 language | |1 in | |1 the | |0 Schedule | |1 to | |1 the | |0 ISDA | , |1 and | there |0 is | |1 a | |0 minor | |0 credit | / |0 billing | |0 issue | |1 in | |0 Paragraph | |1 13 | |0 related | |1 to | |1 the | |0 timing | |1 of | |0 transfer | |1 of | |0 interest | |1 on | |0 collateral | that |0 Val | |1 will | |0 discuss | |1 with | |0 Ed | |0 as | |0 well | ."
"|0 As | |0 far | as |1 the | |0 EEI | |0 goes | , |1 the | |0 only | |0 remaining | |0 issue | that I |1 'm | |0 aware | |1 of | ( |0 aside | from |0 finalizing | |1 the | |0 LOC | ) |0 is | whether we |1 've | |0 finished | |0 coordinating | |1 the | |0 Attachment | |0 containing | |1 the | |0 list | |1 of | |0 prior | |0 transactions | ."

"|1 The | |0 most | |0 important | |0 question | |0 is | n't whether |0 Discovery | |1 is | |0 technically | |0 ready | to |0 fly | |1 with | |0 new | |0 safety | |0 features | |1 and | |0 emergency | |0 procedures | , |1 but | whether |1 the | |0 agency | itself |1 has | |0 learned | |1 from | |1 the | |0 crucial | |0 errors | |0 most | |0 common | |1 to | |0 Challenger | |1 and | |0 Columbia | , |0 errors | that |0 grew | |1 out | |1 of | |1 a | |0 management | |0 culture | that |0 discouraged | |0 criticism | |1 and | |0 sacrificed | |0 safety | |1 for | |0 image | - |0 puffing | |1 and | |0 budget | - |0 cutting | ."

"|0 Seeing | |1 another | "" |0 Columbia | "" |0 incident | |1 can | |1 be | |0 quite | |0 frightening | ( I |0 woke | |1 up | |1 to | it |0 early | |1 in | |1 the | |0 morning | |0 when | I |1 was | |1 in | |0 Texas | ) ."

|1 But | |0 supporters | |1 are | |0 pointing | |1 a | |0 few | |0 good | |0 things | |1 out | :
"|0 Clearly | , |1 the | |0 agency | |1 has | |0 worked | |0 hard | at |0 tackling | |1 the | |0 technical | |0 challenges | |0 posed | |1 by | |1 a | |0 superb | |1 and | |0 surprisingly | |0 independent | - |0 minded | |0 investigative | |0 panel | ."

|0 NASA | |0 has | |1 some | |0 PR | |0 hurdles | to |0 overcome | |1 in | |1 the | |0 future | .
|1 But | |0 let | s |0 hope | |1 for | their |0 sake | ( |1 and | |1 the | |0 sake | |1 of | |1 all | |0 space | |0 lovers | |0 out | |0 there | ) that they |1 can | |0 redefine | their |0 image | |1 and | |0 rekindle | |1 the | |0 hope | |1 of | |0 space | |0 colonization | |0 again | .

"|0 Think | |1 of | |1 all | |0 life | , if you |1 will | , |1 as | |1 one | |0 great | |0 choir | |1 or | |1 one | |0 grand | |0 congregation | ."

|0 When | |1 the | |0 healthy | |0 treat | |1 the | |0 sick | |1 with | |0 scorn | |1 and | |0 intolerance | it |0 brings | us |1 all | |0 down | .

"If we |1 are | |0 all | |1 in | |1 this | |0 thing | |0 together | , |0 let | 's |0 play | |0 nice | ."
"|0 Remember | that what you |0 do | |1 to | yourself |0 affects | me |1 and | everybody |0 else | , |0 remember | that what you |0 do | |1 to | me |1 and | anyone |0 else | |0 shapes | your |0 destiny | ."
"|0 No | |0 matter | |1 what | |0 progress | we |0 make | |1 as | |0 individuals | in |0 becoming | |0 healthier | , we |1 will | |0 never | |0 achieve | |0 real | |0 health | until we |0 collectively | |0 decide | to |0 create | |1 a | |0 healthier | |0 reality | ."
|0 Fortunately | |0 circumstances | |1 will | |0 force | our |0 hand | |0 soon | since our |0 collective | |0 bad | |0 behaviour | |1 can | not |0 continue | |0 indefinitely | .
|1 In | |1 the | |0 near | |0 future | |0 collective | |0 choices | |1 will | |0 need | to |1 be | |0 made | .
|1 Will | we |0 choose | to |0 live | |1 in | |0 harmony | |1 with | |1 this | |0 planet | |1 or | |0 crash | |1 and | |0 burn | |1 in | |1 a | |0 conflagration | |1 of | |0 arrogance | |1 and | |0 disregard | ?

|0 China | 's |0 insatiable | |0 demand | |1 for | |0 energy | |1 is | |0 prompting | |0 fears | |1 of | |0 financial | |1 and | |0 diplomatic | |0 collisions | |1 around | |1 the | |0 globe | as it |0 seeks | |0 reliable | |0 supplies | |1 of | |0 oil | |1 from | |0 as | |0 far | |0 away | |1 as | |0 Brazil | |1 and | |0 Sudan | .
|1 An | |0 intrusion | |1 into | |0 Japanese | |0 territorial | |0 waters | |1 by | |1 a | |0 Chinese | |0 nuclear | |0 submarine | |0 last | |0 week | |1 and | |1 a | |0 trade | |0 deal | |1 with | |0 Brazil | |1 are | |1 the | |0 latest | |0 apparently | |0 unconnected | |0 consequences | |1 of | |0 China | 's |0 soaring | |0 economic | |0 growth | .

|0 OK | that |1 is | |0 fairly | |0 basic | :) .
|1 The | |0 important | |0 point | |0 is | to |0 develop | |1 some | |0 psycho-spiritual | |0 connection | |1 between | your |0 mind | |1 and | |1 the | |0 universal | |0 Consciousness | |1 or | |0 Supreme | |0 Consciousness | .
|1 Do | n't |0 worry | if you |0 have | |0 trouble | |0 concentrating | |1 on | |1 the | |0 mantra | |1 and | |0 ideation | - that |1 's | |0 normal | .
It |0 takes | |1 some | |0 time | |1 and | |0 practice | to |1 be | |0 able | to |0 focus | |1 on | |1 the | |1 one | |0 thought | .
|1 The | |0 main | |0 thing | |0 is | to |0 keep | |0 practicing | .
"If you |1 do | n't |0 practice | , |0 then | nothing |0 happens | ."
"|0 Well | |0 maybe | |1 a | |0 miracle | |1 could | |0 happen | , |1 but | |0 let | s |0 face | it we |1 're | |0 ordinary | |0 people | |1 and | |0 so | |0 require | |0 practical | |0 day | |1 to | |0 day | |0 techniques | !"

|1 The | |1 One | |0 Reason | |0 Why | |1 All | |0 Americans | |1 Should | |0 Oppose | |1 The | |0 Nomination | |1 Of | |0 Samuel | |0 Alito |

My |0 Fellow | |0 Americans | :
"As |0 many | |1 of | you |1 may | |1 have | |0 heard | , |0 President | |0 Bush | |1 has | |0 nominated | |1 a | |0 long | - |0 time | |0 Federal | |0 Judge | |0 named | |0 Samuel | |0 Alito | to |0 become | |1 the | |0 next | |0 member | |1 of | |1 the | |0 United | |0 States | |0 Supreme | |0 Court | , to |0 fill | |1 a | |0 vacancy | |0 created | |1 by | |1 the | |0 retirement | |1 of | |1 another | |0 member | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Court | ."
"|1 Under | our |0 Constitution | , |1 this | |0 nomination | |1 can | not |0 take | |0 effect | unless |1 and | until |1 the | |0 United | |0 States | |0 Senate | |0 gives | its |0 Consent | , as |0 described | |1 in | our |0 Constitution | , |0 Article | |1 II | , |0 Section | |1 2 | ."
"|1 A | |0 copy | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Constitution | , |1 with | |0 links | |0 back | |1 to | |1 the | |0 official | |0 source | , |1 is | |0 located | |1 at | http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt"
|0 Judge | |0 Samuel | |0 Alito | |1 is | |0 very | |0 highly | |0 qualified | |1 by | |1 all | |1 of | |1 the | |0 normal | |0 standards | |0 used | to |0 evaluate | |0 candidates | |1 for | |1 this | |0 position | :
He |0 has | |1 a | |0 very | |0 high | |0 intellect | .
"He |0 graduated | |0 very | |0 high | |1 in | his |0 class | , |1 from | |0 Princeton | |0 undergraduate | |1 and | |1 from | |0 Law | |0 School | |1 at | |0 Yale | ."
"He |0 has | |1 a | |0 long | |1 and | |0 distinguished | |0 record | , |0 including | |0 many | |0 years | |1 as | |1 a | |0 Federal | |0 Appeals | |0 Judge | , |1 the | |0 next | |0 level | |1 below | |0 Supreme | |0 Court | ."
"He |0 has | |0 encyclopedic | |0 knowledge | |1 of | |0 hundreds | |1 of | |0 different | |0 Supreme | |0 Court | |0 cases | , |1 and | he |1 can | |0 recite | |0 details | |1 from | |0 memory | ."
"He |0 demonstrates | |1 an | |0 excellent | "" |0 Judicial | |0 Temperament | , "" |1 being | |0 courteous | , |0 mild | - |0 mannered | , |0 respectful | |1 of | |1 all | |0 people | ; |0 careful | |1 in | his |0 work | , |0 meticulous | |1 in | |0 detail | ."
His |0 co-workers | |0 love | him .
His |0 fellow | |0 judges | |0 love | him .
His |0 family | |0 loves | him .
|0 President | |0 Bush | |0 loves | him .
"|0 Yes | , it |1 is | |0 true | that |1 some | |0 people | |1 do | n't |0 like | |1 the | |0 way | they |0 think | he |1 will | |0 vote | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Supreme | |0 Court | ."
"|1 But | |0 other | |0 people | |1 do | |0 like | |1 the | |0 way | they |0 think | he |1 will | |0 vote | , |1 and | |1 the | |0 ones | who |0 favor | him |0 seem | to |0 outnumber | |1 the | |0 ones | who |0 oppose | him ."
"|0 So | |0 now | |1 the | |0 Senate | |1 is | |0 getting | |0 ready | to |0 vote | |0 soon | , on whether to |0 approve | him |1 or | not ; |1 and | |1 at | |1 this | |0 moment | ( |0 evening | |1 of | |0 Jan. | |1 27 | , |1 2006 | ) it |0 looks | like he |0 has | |0 more | |1 than | |1 the | |1 fifty | - |1 one | |0 votes | |0 needed | |1 for | |0 approval | ."
"|1 The | |0 President | |1 is | |0 very | |0 eager | to |0 go | |0 ahead | |0 quickly | |1 and | |0 get | |1 this | |0 vote | , because he |0 very | |0 much | |0 wants | to |0 have | |0 Samuel | |0 Alito | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Supreme | |0 Court | , to |1 be | |0 judging | |1 the | |0 cases | |0 Bush | |1 is | |0 interested | |1 in | ."
|0 So | there |0 is | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | |0 hurry | - |1 up | |0 pressure | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Senate | to |0 give | its |0 prompt | |0 vote | |1 of | |0 approval | .
"There |0 is | |1 an | |0 old | |0 saying | that |0 applies | |1 in | |1 this | |0 situation | : "" |0 Act | |1 in | |0 haste | , |0 repent | |1 at | |0 leisure | . """
"|0 Sometimes | you |1 can | |0 make | |1 a | |0 bad | |0 decision | |0 very | |0 quickly | , |0 then | |0 regret | it |1 for | |0 many | |0 years | to |0 come | ."
"That |1 is | what |1 is | |0 about | to |0 happen | |1 with | |0 Judge | |0 Samuel | |0 Alito | , |1 in | my |0 opinion | , because he |0 has | |1 one | |0 tragic | |0 flaw | - |1 a | |0 very | |0 serious | |0 blind | |0 spot | |1 in | his |0 thinking | - which |0 makes | him |0 completely | |0 unacceptable | |1 for | |1 the | |0 position | |1 of | |0 Supreme | |0 Court | |0 Justice | : He |1 does | not |0 really | |0 agree | |1 with | |1 the | |0 system | |1 of | "" |0 Checks | |1 and | |0 Balances | "" |0 built | |1 into | |1 the | |0 Constitution | , |1 and | he |1 is | |0 ready | to |0 start | |0 tearing | it |1 down | |1 in | |0 order | to |0 follow | |1 the | "" |0 Unitary | |0 Executive | |0 Theory | , "" which |0 calls | |1 for | |0 vastly | - |0 increased | |0 Presidential | |0 Power | |1 at | |1 the | |0 expense | |1 of | |0 Congress | |1 and | |1 the | |0 Supreme | |0 Court | ."
|1 And | |1 because | |1 of | |1 this | |0 tragic | |0 flaw | . . .

"|1 In | our |0 Constitutional | |0 system | , we |0 have | |1 three | |0 branches | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Federal | |0 Government | : |1 the | |0 Legislative | , |0 Executive | , |1 and | |0 Judicial | |0 branches | ."
"|1 And | |1 the | |0 basic | |0 idea | |1 behind | |1 the | |0 Checks | |1 and | |0 Balances | we |0 have | |0 is | that if |1 one | |0 branch | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Government | |0 goes | |0 crazy | , |1 the | |0 other | |1 two | |1 can | |0 hold | it |0 down | ."
"|1 But | |0 Samuel | |0 Alito | |0 believes | |1 in | |1 a | |0 little | - |0 known | |0 Constitutional | |0 theory | - |0 called | |1 the | "" |0 Unitary | |0 Executive | |0 Theory | "" - which |0 says | that |1 the | |0 President | |1 should | |0 have | |0 complete | |0 control | |1 over | |1 the | |0 Executive | |0 Branch | , |1 and | that |1 the | |0 Executive | |0 Branch | |1 should | |1 be | |1 in | |0 charge | |1 of | |0 almost | everything that |1 the | |0 Government | |0 actually | |0 does | , |0 including | |1 the | |0 functions | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Independent | |0 Agencies | which |1 were | |0 designed | to |1 be | |0 free | |1 of | |0 Presidential | |0 control | , |1 and | |1 the | |0 Military | , which |0 exists | , which |1 is | |0 regulated | , |1 and | which |1 is | |0 funded | |1 by | |0 specific | |0 authority | |0 given | |1 by | |1 the | |0 Constitution | |1 to | |0 Congress | , |0 not | |1 to | |1 the | |0 President | ."
|1 The | |0 Military | |1 is | not |0 part | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Executive | |0 Branch | : it |1 is | |1 a | |0 separate | |0 entity | .

"|1 And | |0 so | |0 Congress | |1 and | |1 the | |0 Supreme | |0 Court | |0 become | |0 mere | |0 advisors | |1 to | |1 the | |0 President | , |1 with | |1 no | |0 real | |0 authority | |1 over | him ."

If you |0 apply | |1 for | |1 a | |0 skilled | |0 migrant | |0 worker | s |0 visa | |1 and | it |1 is | |0 accepted | |1 do | you |0 have | to |0 find | |0 work | |1 in | |1 the | |0 same | |0 sector | |1 as | your |0 skills | |1 on | your |0 application | |1 or | |1 can | you |0 take | |1 up | |0 other | |0 work | if you |1 ca | n't |0 find | something |1 in | your |0 own | |0 field | .
"I |1 have | |0 posted | |1 this | |0 question | |1 on | |1 the | |0 NZ | |0 visa | |0 site | |1 and | |1 ca | n't |0 get | |1 any | |0 info | , |1 does | anyone |0 know | .???"

"That |1 would | |1 be | |0 preferable | |1 but | it |1 does | n't |0 matter | , |1 could | |1 be | something |0 similar |"
It |0 depends | |1 on | |1 the | |0 conditions | |1 of | your |0 skilled | |0 migrant | |0 visa | .
Your |0 visa | |1 should | |0 say | whether |1 or | |0 not | you |1 are | |0 restricted | to |0 work | |1 in | |1 a | |0 specific | |0 sector | .
If your |0 visa | |1 does | not |0 restrict | you from |0 taking | |1 any | |0 work | |1 in | |0 New | |0 Zealand | |0 then | you |1 can | |0 work | |1 in | |1 any | |0 sector | .
It |0 only | |0 matters | if you |0 received | |1 an | |0 offer | |1 of | |0 employment | |1 or | if you |1 are | |0 currently | |0 working | |1 in | |0 New | |0 Zealand | |1 and | |0 used | |1 that | |0 job | |1 in | your |0 application | to |0 get | your |0 skilled | |0 migrant | |0 visa | .
"|1 In | |0 Chicago | , what |1 is | |1 the | |0 best | |0 restaurant | to |0 dine | |1 at | |1 on | |1 a | |0 budget | ?"
"|0 Downtown | |0 Chicago | , |0 Loop | , |0 North |"
"|0 Take | |1 the | |0 red | |0 line | |1 to | |0 Clark | , |0 then | you |0 turn | |0 right | ."
|0 Walk | |1 2 | |0 blocks | |0 then | |0 turn | |0 right | |0 again | .
|0 Walk | |1 2 | |0 more | |0 blocks | |0 then | |0 cross | |1 the | |0 street | .
"You |1 will | |0 get | |1 to | |1 a | |0 place | |0 called | "" |0 BIG | |0 BOWL | "" ."
|0 THAI | |0 FOOD | |1 AND | |0 ASIAN | .
|0 BEST | |0 PLACE | |0 EVER | !!!!!!!!!!!!
|0 McDonald | s
Not |0 necessarily | |1 the | |0 restaurant | |1 but | what you |0 order | |0 when | you |0 get | |0 there | |1 and | |1 what | |0 time | you |0 go | .
|1 A | |0 lunch | |1 will | |1 be | |0 less | |0 expensive | |1 than | |1 a | |0 dinner | .
You |1 can | |0 order | |0 appetizers | |0 rather | |1 than | |1 a | |0 full | |0 meal | |1 and | |0 have | |0 just | |0 as | |0 good | |1 a | |0 dinner | .
|1 But | |1 the | |0 best | |0 way | |0 is | to |0 use | |0 coupons | .
|0 Check | |1 out | http://www.restaurant.com |0 lots | |1 of | |0 restaurants | you |1 can | |0 look | |1 at | |1 the | |0 menu | |1 and | |0 check | |1 out | |0 prices | .
"Yo |0 also | |1 may | |0 want | to |0 try | "" |0 small | |0 neighborhood | "" |0 restaurants | |1 and | |0 support | |0 family | |0 run | |0 places | |0 rather | |1 than | |1 the | |0 large | |0 corporate | |0 chains | ."
Not that there |0 is | anything |0 wrong | |1 with | that because they |0 also | |0 employ | |0 local | |0 people | that |0 live | |1 and | |0 shop | |1 in | |1 the | |0 area | .
|0 Is | there |1 any | |0 cure | |1 for | |0 mouse | |0 poison | ?

"I |0 know | that |1 the | |0 mouse | |1 will | |0 probably | |0 die | , |1 but | I |1 was | |0 wondering | if there |0 is | |1 any | |0 cure | |1 for | |0 mouse | |0 poison | ?"
I |0 just | |0 hate | to |0 see | |1 the | |0 poor | |0 dears | |0 experience | |1 a | |0 slow | |0 painful | |0 death | |1 that | |0 way | :( .
"Without |0 knowing | |1 the | |0 exact | |0 poison | , |0 no | ."
|1 A | |0 common | |0 one | |1 is | |0 arsenic | |1 and | there |0 really | |0 is | n't |1 a | |0 way | to |0 cure | that .
|0 Take | |1 the | |0 mouse | |1 to | |1 an | |0 emergency | |0 vet | |1 and | |0 have | them |0 use | |0 CO2 | to |0 put | |1 the | |0 mouse | |1 to | |0 sleep | .
"|0 Or | , you |1 can | |0 put | |1 the | |0 animal | |1 in | |1 a | |0 snap | |0 trap | |0 designed | |1 for | |0 rats | |1 or | |0 mice | since that |1 is | |1 the | |0 only | |0 really | |0 humane | |0 kill | |0 method | |1 for | |0 invasive | |0 animals | ."

2 . |1 What | |0 kind | |1 of | |0 paint | |1 do | I |0 use | to |0 paint | |1 the | |0 giraffe | ?
3 . |0 Is | there |1 any | |0 cheap | |0 way | to |0 give | it |1 a | |0 shine | like I |0 made | it |1 in | |1 a | |0 kiln | ?
"|0 air | |0 dry | |0 clay | |0 works | |1 on | |0 armatures | , |1 the | |0 clay | |0 has | |1 a | |0 minor | |0 shrink | |0 percent | , |0 so | you |1 can | |0 leave | |1 the | |0 wire | |0 armature | |0 inside | , |0 paint | |1 with | |0 acrylic | |0 paint |"

|1 Should | i |0 bring | her ?

"If your |0 cat | |1 is | not |0 trained | to |0 use | |1 the | |0 litter | |0 pan | , you |1 may | |0 have | |1 a | |0 problem | |0 taking | her ."
|0 NO | !
"|0 changing | its |0 surroundings | |0 too | |0 often | |1 will | |0 stress | it |1 out | |1 and | it |1 will | |0 get | |0 depressed | , |0 mean | , |0 sick | , |1 or | |1 will | not |0 want | to |1 be | |1 around | you ."
|1 What | |0 cleaners | |1 should | I |0 use | for |0 dusting | |1 around | my |0 parakeet | ?
|1 What | |0 cleaners | |1 can | I |0 use | to |0 dust | |1 around | my |0 budgie | .
|1 Would | |0 pledge | |1 be | |0 ok | ?
"If not , what |0 is | ?"
Your |0 best | |0 bet | |1 would | |0 just | |1 be | |1 a | |0 swiffer | |0 duster | -- they |1 do | n't |0 require | |0 cleaner | .
"If you |1 must | |0 use | |1 a | |0 cleaner | , |0 pledge | |1 should | |1 be | |0 fine | if |1 the | |0 area | that you |0 keep | your |0 parakeet | |1 in | |0 is | |0 well | |0 ventilated | ."
"I |1 have | |0 had | |0 parakeets | |1 for | |1 a | |0 VERY | |0 long | |0 time | , |1 and | I |0 use | |0 pledge | ."
|0 Just | |0 keep | |1 a | |0 window | |0 open | |1 for | |1 a | |0 while | for |0 fresh | |0 air | to |0 circulate | .

|0 Even | |1 a | |0 cotton | |0 cloth | ( I |0 like | |0 diapers | ) that |1 is | |0 barely | |0 damp | |1 w | |0 water | |1 will | |0 work | |0 fine | .
|0 Swiffer | |1 or | |1 any | |0 type | |1 of | |0 micro-fiber | |0 cloth | |1 is | |0 excellent | .
"I |0 use | |0 Miracle | |0 Cloth | , they |1 're | |0 fantastic | , |0 just | |1 do | n't |0 use | |0 fabric | |0 softener | |1 or | |0 dryer | |0 sheets | |0 when | |0 cleaning | them , it |0 ruins | their "" |0 grabbing | "" |0 ability | ."

If |1 in | |0 dongle | you |0 mean | |0 USB | |0 stick | |0 then | |0 yes | |0 USB | |0 sticks | |1 are | |1 the | |0 same | any |0 were | you |0 go | :) |0 hope | that |0 answered | your |0 question | .
|0 How | |1 do | I |0 take | |0 care | |1 of | my |0 newborn | |0 baby | |0 fish | ?
"I |1 am | |0 nervous | that my |0 other | |0 fish | |1 will | |0 eat | them , |1 and | I |1 do | n't |0 know | what to |0 feed | them !"
I |1 have | |0 counted | |0 around | |1 25 | |1 of | them |1 and | they |0 currently | |0 reside | |1 in | |1 a | |1 20 | |0 gallon | |0 tank | .
You |1 could | |0 move | |1 all | |1 the | |0 babies | |1 into | |1 a | |0 fry | |0 net | |0 breeder | |1 or | |0 move | |1 all | |1 of | |1 the | |0 bigger | |0 fish | ( |0 also | |1 the | |0 parents | ) |1 to | |1 a | |0 different | |0 tank | to |0 avoid | |1 the | |0 babies | |1 getting | |0 eaten | .
|0 Feed | |1 the | |0 babies | |1 3 | - |1 4 | |0 times | |1 a | |0 day | |1 with | |0 flakes | .
"|0 Provide | |0 plenty | |1 of | |0 hiding | |0 places | |1 like | |0 rocks | , |0 plants | , etc |1 in | |1 the | |0 tank | ."
It |1 s | |0 natural | for |1 some | |0 babies | to |1 be | |0 eaten | |1 by | |0 adults | |1 and | if |1 all | |1 of | them |0 survived | your |0 tank | |1 would | |1 be | |0 very | |0 overcrowded | .
"|0 Look | |1 in | |1 the | |0 pet | |0 stores | |1 for | "" |0 fry | |0 food | "" |1 or | "" |0 baby | |0 fish | |0 foods | "" ."
|1 what | |0 kind | |1 of | |0 newborn | |0 fish | you |0 have | ?
|1 some | |0 parents | |1 would | not |0 eat | there |0 fish | |1 till | |1 a | |0 certain | |0 age | |0 jack | |0 dempsey | |1 for | |0 example | |1 would | not |0 eat | there |0 offspring | till they |0 mature | |1 but | i |1 would | |0 move | |1 the | |0 baby | |0 fish | |1 into | |1 a | |0 smaller | |0 tank | |1 and | |0 feed | them |0 flakes |

|0 bearded | |0 dragon | |0 spikes | ?
|0 bit | |1 of | |1 a | |0 stupid | |0 question | |1 but | |1 do | |1 the | |0 spikes | / |0 spines | ( |1 whatever | you |0 call | them ) |1 on | their |0 side | |1 and | |0 face | |0 area | |0 ever | |0 go | |0 hard | .
|1 or | |1 are | they |0 just | |0 supposed | to |0 look | like they |0 are | so nothing |1 will | |0 try | to |0 eat | them
|0 becca | |1 is | |0 right | .
i |1 v | |0 owned | |0 beardies | |1 for | |1 ovr | |1 3 | |0 yrs | |1 and | i |0 handle | mine |1 all | |1 the | |0 time | .. they |1 do | nt |0 go | |0 hard | |1 lik | |0 eneedle | |0 hard | |1 but | they |0 ar | nt |0 pillow | |0 soft | .
they |0 use | them to |0 look | |0 prickly | .. |1 would | you |0 try | to |0 eat | |1 a | |0 cactus | [ if u |0 had | |1 no | |0 knife | ] i |0 know | i |1 would | nt .
they |0 puff | |0 out | to |0 look | |0 bigger | |1 and | |0 badder | |1 and | they |1 can | |0 scratch | you |1 a | |0 lil | if u |1 r | |0 holding | them |0 to | |0 tight | :)
They |1 re | not |0 really | |0 hard | .
|0 Beardies | |1 are | |0 actually | |0 quite | |0 delicate | .
I |1 'm | |0 assuming | it |0 's | to |0 scare | |1 off | |0 predators | / like |0 how | they |1 will | |0 puff | |1 up | their |0 neck | |0 spikes | to |0 make | them |0 look | |0 bigger | |1 to | |0 predators | |1 or | |0 enemies | .
they |1 do | nt |0 hurt | unless you |1 r | |0 stupid | |0 enough | to |0 press | |1 on | them .
They |0 just | |0 are | |0 there | |1 as | |1 an | |0 adaptation | .
what |1 is | |1 a | |0 kimberwick | |0 bit | |0 used | |1 for | ?
"|0 Used | |1 as | |1 a | |0 help | |1 for | |0 horses | that |1 are | |0 quite | |0 strong | |0 pullers | while |0 hacking | , |0 hunting | |1 and | |0 doing | |0 cross | |0 country | ."
It |1 is | |1 a | |0 curb | |0 bit | |1 with | |1 a | |0 ported | |0 mouth | |0 piece | |1 and | |1 some | |0 horses | |0 appreciate | this to |0 give | them |0 more | |0 room | |1 in | their |0 mouths | |1 for | their |0 tongues | .
"It |1 is | not |0 as | |0 precise | |1 as | |1 a | |0 pelham | |0 bit | because it |0 only | |0 uses | |1 one | |0 rein | , though |1 the | |0 modern | |0 ones | |0 have | |1 two | |1 or | |1 three | |0 slots | |1 on | which to |0 put | |1 the | |0 reins | ."

|1 For | |0 horses | that |1 are | |0 strong | |0 pullers | .

It |1 's | |0 nice | |1 for | |0 horses | that |0 need | |1 a | |0 little | |0 more | |1 than | |1 a | |0 snaffle | .

|0 Hotels | |1 for | |0 travelling | |1 will | |1 be | |0 expensive | .
anybody |1 is | |0 open | |1 to | |0 answers | |1 but | I |1 would | |0 much | |0 prefere | somebody |1 with | |0 traveling | |0 experience | .

|0 Wool | |1 is | |0 best | .

"|0 Vietnamese | |0 girl | 's |0 name | , |0 Mayko | ?"
I |0 always | |0 thought | |0 Mayko | |1 or | |0 Meiko | |1 is | |1 a | |0 Japanese | |0 name | .
|1 The | |0 Canadian | |0 Regenesis | |0 actress | |0 Mayko | |0 Nguyen | |0 has | |0 Japanese | |0 connection | |1 or | |1 is | it her |0 fake | |0 name | ?
"|0 Right | , I |1 could | n't |0 find | |1 any | |0 proven | |0 source | |1 for | that ."
"|1 And | her |0 last | |0 name | , |0 Nguyen | |1 is | |1 a | |0 typical | |0 Vietnamese | |0 family | |0 name | ... anyone ?"
"|0 Certainly | , |0 Nguyen | |1 is | |1 the | |0 one | |1 of | |0 first | |0 names | |1 of | |0 many | |0 people | |1 in | |0 Vietnam | , |0 only | |1 in | |0 Vietnam | ."
|0 Mayko | |1 is | |0 relating | |1 to | |1 the | |0 Japanese | .
"|1 In | |0 Vietnam | , |0 when | |1 a | |0 baby | |1 was | |0 born | , they |1 must | |1 be | |0 named | "" |0 first | |0 name | "" |0 according | |1 to | that |1 of | their |0 fathers | ."
"It |1 's | |0 principle | |1 except | |1 a | |0 number | |1 of | |0 cases | , |1 for | |0 example | , |1 the | |0 babies | |1 are | |0 orphans | |1 or | not |1 to | |0 have | |0 father | ."
E.g .
"|0 Full | |0 name | |1 of | |1 the | |0 father | |1 is | : "" |0 Nguyen | |0 Thanh | |0 Luan | "" ===> |0 Full | |0 name | |1 of | |1 the | |0 son | / |0 daughter | |0 certainly | |1 is | "" |0 Nguyen | .......... "" , |1 for | |0 instance | , "" |0 Nguyen | |0 Thi | |0 Thuy | |0 Lan | "" ."
"|1 But | if |1 the | |0 babies | |1 were | |0 born | |1 in | |0 American | |0 so | they |1 would | |0 named | |1 in | |0 other | |0 way | |1 but | |0 still | |0 remain | "" |0 First | |0 name | "" |1 in | |0 order | to |0 recall | |1 about | their |0 origination | ."
I |1 'm | |0 pretty | |0 sure | that |0 Mayko | |1 is | |0 Japanese | .
She |1 is | |1 a | |0 Canadian | |0 born | |0 Vietnamese | .
I |1 'm | not |0 sure | |0 where | her |0 first | |0 name | |1 is | |1 from | ...
I |0 have | |1 a | |0 splitter | / |0 filter | |1 between | my |0 ADSL | |1 and | |0 ph | |0 line | ?

|0 Why | |1 is | it |0 stil | |0 doing | this |0 even | though I |1 do | n't |0 have | |1 the | |0 other | |0 phone | |0 connected | ?
|1 Woud | it |1 be | |0 better | if I |0 got | |1 another | |0 filter | |1 and | |0 connected | |1 the | |0 other | |0 phone | |0 as | |0 well | ?
|0 turn | |1 the | |0 modem | |1 off | |1 and | |0 see | if |1 the | |0 sound | |1 is | |0 still | |0 there | ... |1 could | |1 be | |0 static | |1 on | |1 the | |0 line | ... if |1 the | |0 sound | |1 is | |0 still | |0 there | with |1 the | |0 modem | |0 off | |0 then | |1 the | |0 problem | |1 is | NOT |1 the | |0 DSL | ....
"if |1 the | |0 trouble | |0 goes | |0 away | with |1 the | |0 modem | |0 off | , |0 then | |0 make | |0 sure | that EVERYTHING |1 EXCEPT | |1 the | |0 modem | |1 is | |0 filtered | , this |1 would | |0 include | |1 the | |0 alarm | |0 system | , |0 fax | |0 machine | , |0 satellite | |0 boxes | , |0 phones | , etc ..."

"You |0 need | |1 either | |1 a | |0 filter | |1 for | |1 each | |0 device | |1 except | |1 the | |0 DSL | |0 modem | , |1 or | |1 a | |0 whole | |0 home | |0 filter | which |0 filters | |1 all | |1 the | |0 jacks | , |1 except | |1 the | |0 one | which |1 the | |0 DSL | |0 modem | |0 connects | ."

|0 HAMSTERS | - |1 will | |1 a | |0 hamster | |1 be | |0 ok | |0 living | |1 in | |1 the | |0 bathroom | ?

|1 or | |1 would | |1 the | |0 steam | |1 from | |1 the | |0 shower | |1 be | |1 a | |0 problem | ?

There |0 are | |1 some | |0 things | to |0 consider | |0 though | ...
"|0 Rodents | |0 require | |0 special | |0 bedding | |1 in | their |0 cages | to |0 absorb | their |0 waste | , |1 and | this |0 needs | to |1 be | |0 cleaned | |0 regularly | , |1 or | your |0 hamster | |1 could | |0 suffer | |1 from | |0 problems | |1 due | |1 the | |0 buildup | |1 of | |0 ammonia | |1 from | his |0 urine | ."
"|0 When | you |0 take | |1 a | |0 warm | |0 shower | |1 and | |0 build | |1 up | |0 steam | , his |0 cage | |1 will | |0 collect | |0 water | , |1 the | |0 bedding | |1 will | |0 absorb | |0 much | |1 of | it , |1 and | |1 will | not |1 be | |0 able | to |0 absorb | |1 the | |0 urine | |0 quite | as it |1 should | ."
You |1 will | |0 also | |0 have | to |1 be | |0 wary | of |0 mold | |0 forming | |1 on | |1 any | |0 toys | |1 or | |0 hide | - |0 aways | he |1 may | |0 have | .
You |0 also | |1 do | n't |0 want | it |0 getting | |0 too | |0 warm | |1 for | him |0 too | |0 often | .
"|0 Overall | , it |1 is | not |1 a | |0 good | |0 solution | , |1 but | you |1 can | |0 keep | him |0 healthy | |1 and | |0 pull | it |1 off | if you |0 take | |1 the | |0 time | to |0 give | him |1 the | |0 extra | |0 care | he |1 will | |0 need | |1 because | |1 of | it ."
It |1 may | |1 be | |1 a | |0 problem | because |1 the | |0 temperature | |1 is | |0 constantly | |0 changing | .
I |1 would | |0 personally | |0 put | him |0 somewhere | |0 else | .

|0 Only | |1 a | |0 fool | |1 would | |0 base | |1 a | |0 decision | |0 using | |1 the | |0 cheapest | |0 surgeon | to |0 perform | |1 an | |0 operation | .

|1 Do | you |0 really | |0 want | to |0 put | your |0 faith | |1 in | |1 some | |0 clinic | |0 doctor | .
I |0 know | I |1 would | n't .
You |0 need | to |0 check | |1 with | |1 one | |1 of | |1 the | |0 major | |0 hospital | that |0 performance | |1 this | |0 procedure | |1 like | |0 Bumrungard | |0 Hospital | |1 or | |0 Yanhee | |0 Hospital | .

"|0 Sometimes | |1 the | "" |0 cheap | "" |0 comes | |0 expensive | !"

|0 Bumrungrad | |0 Hospital | |0 does | |1 some | |0 good | |0 work | |1 but | |1 all | |0 hospitals | |1 do | |0 have | their |0 problems | |1 from | |0 time | |1 to | |0 time | .
|0 Maybe | |0 having | |1 an | |0 experienced | |0 doctor | |1 might | |1 be | |0 better | |1 than | |1 some | |0 guy | that |1 is | |0 cheaper | |1 but | |0 less | |0 experienced | !

|0 When | you |0 read | |1 the | |0 label | it |1 s | |0 easy | to |0 understand | |0 why | .
I |1 've | |0 had | |0 cats | |1 for | |1 35 | |0 years | |1 and | I |0 only | |0 feed | them |0 dry | |0 food | .
They |1 have | |0 done | |0 very | |0 well | |1 and | |0 like | |1 the | |0 dry | |0 food | |0 better | .
It |0 had | |0 better | |0 nutritional | |0 value | |1 and | it |1 s | |0 also | |0 less | |0 expensive | .

"What |0 matters | |1 is | |0 how | |0 well | |0 trained | he |1 is | , |1 and | |0 how | |0 good | your |0 bond | |0 it | ."
That |1 is | |1 another | |0 reason | |0 why | I |0 like | |0 competitive | |0 trail | |0 riding | |0 also | .

Unless |1 the | |0 tank | |0 has | |1 a | |0 built | |1 in | |0 overflow | |0 box | ( which I |1 'm | |0 certain | it |0 does | n't ) |0 then | you |0 have | to |0 get | |1 one | |1 of | |1 those | |0 hang | |1 on | |0 back | |0 overflow | |0 boxes | so that you |1 can | |0 install | |1 a | |0 sump | .
|1 The | |0 piping | |1 would | |0 lead | |0 down | |1 into | your |0 sump | |1 from | |1 the | |0 overflow | |0 box | .
"|1 On | |1 the | |0 other | |0 end | |1 of | |1 the | |0 sump | , you |1 would | |0 have | |1 a | |0 small | |0 return | |0 pump | |1 with | |1 a | |0 hose | that |0 puts | |1 the | |0 water | |0 back | |1 into | your |0 tank | ."

I |0 have | |1 a | |1 3 | |0 week | |0 old | |0 baby | |0 budgie | |1 and | I |0 noticed | that his / her |0 mother | |1 does | not |0 stay | |1 with | him |1 in | |1 the | |0 nest | |1 at | |0 night | .
I |0 have | to |0 mention | that i |0 recently | |0 separated | |1 the | |0 father | |1 into | |1 another | |0 cage | |0 close | |1 to | |1 the | ' |0 nest | |0 cage | ' because he |1 and | |1 the | |0 mother | |1 were | |0 fighting | .
"He |1 was | |0 so | |0 eager | to |0 go | |1 in | |1 the | |0 nest | |1 and | |0 feed | |1 the | |0 baby | |1 and | she |0 always | |1 would | |0 go | |0 right | |0 away | |1 in | |1 the | |0 nest | |1 after | him |1 and | |0 give | him |1 a | |0 fight | |0 right | |0 there | , |0 were | |1 the | |0 baby | |0 was | |0 too | ."
I |0 thought | it |1 was | |0 dangerous | |1 for | |1 the | |0 baby | |0 so | I |0 moved | him .
"She |0 feeds | |0 well | |1 the | |0 baby | |1 on | her |0 own | , |1 the | |0 baby | |1 is | |0 ok | |1 but | she |1 does | not |0 go | |1 in | |1 the | |0 nest | to |0 stay | |1 with | him |1 at | |0 night | ..."
What |1 is | |1 the | |0 problem | ?
|1 Is | this |1 a | |0 transitional | |0 period | |1 for | |1 the | |0 baby | ... that he / she |1 is | |0 left | |0 alone | |0 much | |0 more | |0 time | ?
I |0 have | to |0 say | that |1 the | |0 baby | |1 does | not |0 scream | |1 after | her |1 of | anything ... he / she |0 sleeps | .
|0 Budgies | |1 are | |0 breast | |0 feeding | |0 birds | |1 and | it |1 may | |0 be | |1 the | |0 male | |1 is | |0 bisexual | .
|0 When | |1 the | |0 male | |0 gets | his |0 titts | |0 out | |1 the | |0 female | |0 gets | |0 mad | |1 with | him |0 knowing | he |1 ca | n't |0 produce | |0 milk | .
It |1 's | |0 fine | - |0 just | |0 make | |0 sure | that |1 the | |0 room | |1 the | |0 cage | |1 is | |1 in | |1 is | |0 kept | |0 warm | .
If |1 the | |0 baby | |1 is | |0 feathered | |0 yet | - which I |1 'm | |0 sure | he |1 is | |0 mostly | - he |1 should | |1 be | |0 fine | .
|0 Just | |0 remember | to |0 make | |0 sure | |1 the | |0 mother | |1 is | |0 properly | |0 caring | |1 for | |1 the | |0 baby | .
"|0 Ignore | |1 the | |0 answer | |1 above | me , |0 btw | ! ^_^"
|1 Can | I |0 text | |1 from | |0 Canada | |1 to | |1 the | |0 united | |0 states | ?
"|0 Ok | |0 maybe | that |1 is | n't |1 the | |0 right | |0 question | , |1 but | my |0 question | |0 is | |1 can | you |0 text | |1 from | |1 a | |0 united | |0 states | |0 number | |0 when | you |1 r | |1 in | |0 canada | , |1 can | you |0 send | |0 texts | |1 to | |1 another | |0 united | |0 states | |0 number | ?"

|0 So | I |0 just | |0 needed | to |0 know | if it |1 is | |1 a | |0 suitable | |0 place | to |0 live | |1 in | |1 and | |1 in | |1 what | |0 ways | .
"|0 Also | that , I |0 heard | |1 in | |1 the | |0 next | |0 few | |0 years | |0 Fujairah | |1 would | |1 be | |0 as | |0 good | |1 as | |0 Dubai | , |1 is | it |0 true | ?"
"I |1 'd | |1 be | |0 happy | if someone |0 helps | , |0 especially | someone who |1 has | |1 been | |1 to | |0 Fujairah | |1 or | |0 lives | |0 there | . :)"

... I |1 ve | |1 been | |0 living | |1 in | |0 Fujairah | my |0 entire | |0 life | |1 and | I |1 must | |0 say | that it |1 is | |0 developing | |1 in | |1 a | |0 good | |0 way | .
I |0 think | |1 2012 | |1 is | |0 going | to |1 be | |1 a | |0 great | |0 year | |1 for | |0 Fujairah | as we |0 have | |1 A | |0 LOT | |1 of | |0 projects | to |1 be | |0 done | |1 by | |1 2012 | .
|0 Things | to |0 do | |1 in | |0 Fujairah | ..
It |1 s | |1 between | |0 sea | |1 and | |0 mountains | |0 so | you |1 can | |0 camp | |1 on | |0 beach | |1 or | |1 between | |0 mountains | !

|1 And | |0 now | they |1 are | |0 finishing | |1 a | |0 road | |1 between | |0 Fujairah | |1 and | |0 Dubai | |1 in | |1 45 | |0 minutes | |0 only | !
"|0 So | , |0 no | it |1 is | not |0 as | |0 good | |1 as | |0 Dubai | , |1 but | it |1 s | |0 quieter | |1 and | |0 more | |0 peaceful | , |1 and | you |1 can | |0 still | |0 go | |1 to | |0 Dubai | |1 in | |1 45 | |0 mins | ."
|0 please | |0 let | me |0 know | if you |0 need | anything |0 else |
|0 Visited | |0 Fujairah | |0 when | |1 in | |0 Dubai | .

|1 Do | n't |0 know | |1 the | |0 economics | |1 of | |0 Fujairah | |1 but | |0 Dubai | |1 is | |0 basically | |0 bankrupt | |0 so | you |1 would | n't |0 want | to |0 end | |1 up | |1 like | them !
Unless you |0 have | |1 a | |0 particular | |0 skill | they |0 need | - |1 and | |0 firm | |0 job | |0 offer | before |0 going | - I |1 would | |0 think | |0 twice | |1 about | it !

"He |1 's | |1 a | |0 good | |0 kitty | , |0 just | |0 when | he |0 plays | he |0 bites | |0 REALLY | |0 hard | ."
"|0 Almost | |1 every | |0 day | he |1 'd | |0 even | |0 wake | me |1 up | |1 like | |1 5 | |0 am | |1 in | |1 the | |0 morning | , |0 trying | to |0 bite | my |0 arm | ."
|1 And | |0 when | I |0 move | it I |0 guess | he |0 figures | I |1 'm | |0 playing | . x.x
"I |0 read | |0 somewhere | that you |0 have | to |0 hold | his |0 mouth | |0 together | , |1 and | |0 keep | it |1 that | |0 way | til he |0 panics | ."
That |0 seems | |0 cruel | |1 to | me |0 though | .
|1 Any | |0 other | |0 way | ??
|1 Do | you |0 think | he |1 's | |0 teething | ?
It |1 's | |0 getting | |1 out | |1 of | |0 hand | .
"|0 Yeah | , I |0 thought | that |1 the | |0 holding | his |0 mouth | |0 thing | |0 sounded | |0 wrong | ."
"|1 No | |0 worries | , i |1 did | n't |0 try | ."
"He |1 does | |0 have | |0 toys | , |1 a | |0 scratching | |0 post | , |0 LOTS | |1 of | |0 mice | , |0 balls | , |0 yarn | , |1 a | |0 feathery | |0 birdy | |0 toy | , etc ."
He |1 'd | |0 just | |0 randomly | |0 walk | |1 up | |1 to | you |1 and | |0 start | |1 the | |0 biting | .
"|0 When | i |0 put | him |1 off | |1 of | my |0 bed | , he |0 jumps | |0 back | |0 on | |1 and | |0 same | |0 thing | ."
he |1 may | |1 be | |0 teething | |1 but | i |1 do | nt |0 think | it |1 can | |1 be | |0 stopped | .
|0 maybe | |0 buy | him |0 toys | that he |1 can | |0 play | |1 with | that |0 give | him |1 a | |0 way | to |0 use | his |0 energy | |1 up |
"|0 yes | |1 do | not |0 hold | |1 any | |0 animal | s |0 mouth | |0 shut | it |1 wil | |0 close | their air |0 way | , he |1 s | |0 just | |1 a | |0 kitty | |1 and | they |1 are | |0 very | |0 rambunctious | , |0 get | him |0 toys | ."
"|0 lots | |1 of | them , |0 feather | |0 ones | |0 work | |0 best | , |0 also | |0 when | he |0 bites | you |1 in | |1 the | |0 morning | |0 put | him |1 down | |1 off | your |0 bed | , to |0 show | him that you |1 will | not |0 tolerate | that , he |1 will | |0 get | it , he |1 s | |0 also | |0 probably | |0 teething | , so |0 toys | |1 are | your |0 best | |0 bet |"
|1 Which | |0 rat | |0 cage | |1 is | |0 better | ?
"|0 Hi | , I |0 want | to |0 get | |1 a | |0 few | |0 pet | |0 rats | |1 and | |0 need | |1 a | |0 rat | |0 cage | ."
( |0 Apart | |1 from | |1 the | |0 wire | |0 flooring | which i |1 am | |0 going | to |0 cover | ) Which |1 of | |1 these | |1 two | |0 cages | |1 is | |0 better | :
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_2079wt_893

I |1 ca | nt |0 decide | |1 between | |0 height | |1 or | |0 width | .
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_
|1 This | |0 one | |1 is | |0 better | |1 for | |0 rats | .
You |0 always | |0 want | to |0 go | |0 higher | |0 rather | |1 than | |0 wider | |1 for | |0 rats | .
They |0 LOVE | to |0 climb | .
"You |1 will | |0 have | to |0 cover | |1 the | |0 wire | |0 flooring | like you |0 said | , |1 and | |0 make | |0 fleece | |0 covers | |1 for | |1 the | |0 stairs | , so |1 no | |0 ratty | |0 feet | |1 get | |0 caught | |1 and | |0 broken | ."
|1 This | |0 cage | |1 will | |0 hold | |0 about | |1 2 | - |1 3 | |0 rats | .
|1 Both | |1 are | |0 equal | |0 length | |0 so | |0 go | |1 for | |1 the | |0 taller | |1 one | .
If you |0 use | |1 this | |0 cage | it |1 's | |0 best | to |0 remove | |1 the | |0 wire | |0 shelves | |0 altogether | |1 and | |0 replace | it |1 with | |0 hammocks | |1 and | |1 the | |0 like | .
"I |0 used | |1 one | |1 of | |1 these | |0 cages | |0 short | |0 term | |1 for | |1 a | |0 pet | |1 and | it |1 was | n't |0 that | |0 great | to |1 be | |0 honest | , |0 pretty | |0 cheaply | |0 made | , |1 the | |0 door | |0 springs | |1 are | |0 annoying | |1 and | it |1 does | n't |0 last | |0 very | |0 well | ."
|0 Here | |1 are | |1 some | |0 better | |0 options | |0 IMO | :

These |1 are | |0 all | |1 a | |0 bit | |0 more | |0 expensive | |1 than | your |0 choice | |1 but | if you |0 ebay | |0 search | |1 the | |0 names | you |1 may | |1 be | |0 able | to |0 find | |1 one | |0 second | |0 hand | ... |0 better | |0 paying | |1 for | |1 a | |0 second | |0 hand | |1 one | |1 in | |0 good | |0 condition | |1 than | |1 a | |0 poorly | |0 made | |0 new | |0 one | |0 IMO | .
|1 The | |0 First | |0 One | |1 Is | |0 much | |0 Better | !
"I |0 Have | |1 This | |0 Exact | |0 Cage | , |0 Bought | |1 From | |1 The | |0 Exact | |0 Ebay | |0 User | ."
"It |1 s | |0 Really | |0 Good | |1 And | |1 The | |0 Rat | |0 Calculater | |0 Says | |1 Is | |0 Big | |0 Enough | |1 For | |1 5 | |0 Rats | , |1 But | I |1 Would | |0 Put | |1 A | |0 Maximum | |1 Of | |1 4 | |1 In | It |0 Really | :)"
|1 is | |1 under | |0 tank | |0 heating | |1 or | |0 side | |0 tank | |0 heating | |0 better | |1 for | |1 a | |0 corn | |0 snake | ?
i |1 was | |0 reading | |1 the | |0 package | |1 for | |1 a | |0 tank | |0 heater | i |0 bought | |1 for | my |1 40 | |0 gallon | |0 tank | |1 for | my |0 snake | |1 and | it |0 said | it |1 can | |1 be | |0 put | |1 under | |1 the | |0 tank | |1 or | |1 on | |1 the | |0 side | .
i |0 m | not |0 worried | about |0 damaging | |1 the | |0 surface | my |0 tank | |1 is | |1 on | because i |1 can | |0 prop | it |1 up | |1 off | |1 the | |0 surface | |0 anyway | .
"|1 from | my |0 understanding | , if it |1 s | |0 heated | |1 from | |1 the | |0 bottom | , my |0 snake | |0 risks | |0 burning | its |0 belly | if it |0 burrows | |1 and | |0 rests | |0 directly | |1 on | |0 top | |1 of | |1 the | |0 glass | |1 over | |1 the | |0 heater | unless i |0 buy | |1 some | |1 of | |1 that | |0 reptile | |0 carpet | to |0 put | |1 under | |1 the | |0 substrate | , |1 but | it |0 has | |0 better | |0 heat | |0 distribution |"
"if it |1 s | |1 from | |1 the | |0 side | i |1 do | nt |0 have | to |0 worry | about |0 propping | it |1 up | , |1 but | |1 the | |0 snake | |1 can | |0 still | |0 burn | itself if it |0 slithers | |1 along | |1 the | |0 side | |1 of | |1 the | |0 tank | |1 and | i |0 also | |0 read | that it |1 does | nt |0 distribute | |0 heat | |0 as | |0 well | ?"
what |1 are | your |0 suggestions | |1 and | |0 opinons | ?
i |0 use | |0 UTH's | |1 on | |1 all | |1 of | my |0 burrowing | |0 snakes | .
they |1 will | |0 move | if they |0 get | |0 too | |0 warm | - it |1 's | not |1 like | |1 a | |0 heat | |0 rock | which you |1 should | |0 avoid | |1 at | |1 all | |0 costs | .
i |0 usually | |0 put | my |0 own | |0 natural | |0 rock | |1 over | |1 the | |0 UTH | |1 and | they |1 are | |0 perfectly | |0 fine | .
"i |0 have | |0 over | |1 40 | |0 corns | , |0 kings | , |1 and | |0 milks | |1 and | |1 have | |0 never | |0 had | |1 a | |0 problem | |1 with | |1 the | |0 UTH | |0 system | ."
|1 on | |1 the | |0 side | |1 is | |1 a | |0 waste | - |0 leave | it |1 on | |1 the | |0 bottom | .
|0 good | |0 luck | !
|0 Bottom | if you |1 are | |0 worried | about |1 the | |0 snake | |0 burning | itself |0 put | something |1 overt | it |1 like | |0 newspaper | ...
I |0 now | |0 use | |1 a | |1 75 | |0 watt | |0 basking | |1 or | |0 heat | |0 bulb | |1 for | mine |1 and | he |0 seems | to |0 like | it
|0 put | |1 the | |0 heater | |1 on | |1 the | |0 snake | he |1 will | |0 love | it |1 and | |1 the | |1 the | |0 next | |0 day | you |1 will | |0 have | |0 dinner |

|0 Question | |1 about | |1 the | |0 sinking | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Titanic | ?
"|1 After | |1 the | |0 sinking | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Titanic | |1 in | |1 1912 | , |0 was | there |1 a | |0 law | |0 made | so that |0 ships | |1 would | |0 carry | |0 enough | |0 lifeboats | to |0 save | everybody |1 on | |1 a | |0 ship | if it |1 was | |0 sinking | ?"
"If |0 yes | , |1 was | |0 Canada | |0 involved | |1 in | |1 this | |0 act | / |0 law | ?"
"|0 Sorry | , I |1 'm | |0 just | |0 very | |0 nervous | after |0 watching | |1 the | |0 movie | ."
"|0 SOLAS | ( |0 Safety | |1 Of | |0 Life | |1 At | |0 Sea | ) , which |1 is | |1 an | |0 international | |0 maritime | |0 treaty | , |0 came | |0 about | |1 in | |0 response | |1 to | |1 the | |0 tragedy | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Titanic | ."
"|0 Today | , it |1 is | |1 the | |0 primary | |0 safety | |0 law | |0 affecting | |0 virtually | |1 all | |0 ships | , |0 regardless | |1 of | |0 country | |1 of | |0 registration | ."
"If you |0 ever | |0 go | |1 on | |1 a | |0 cruise | |0 ship | , you |1 will | |1 be | |0 required | to |0 attend | |1 a | |0 SOLAS | |0 muster | |0 drill | ( |0 lifeboat | |0 drill | ) |1 within | |1 24 | |0 hours | |1 of | |0 sailing | ."
|0 Most | |0 ships | |0 perform | |1 this | |0 drill | before |0 even | |0 leaving | |1 the | |0 dock | .

"We |1 are | |0 much | |0 safer | |0 today | |1 on | |1 board | |0 ship | |1 due | |1 to | |0 SOLAS | , |1 and | I |0 suppose | if |1 any | |0 good | |0 came | |1 out | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Titanic | |0 tragedy | , |1 the | |0 adoption | |1 of | |0 SOLAS | |1 is | |0 probably | it ."

"|0 Edit | : |0 Also | I |0 forgot | to |0 mention | |0 earlier | , |0 most | ( if not |1 all | ) |0 cruise | |0 ships | |0 also | |0 practice | |0 lifeboat | |0 drills | |0 weekly | , |1 and | it |1 is | |0 not | |0 uncommon | to |0 see | them to |0 actually | |0 launch | |1 the | |0 lifeboats | |1 into | |1 the | |0 water | |1 as | |0 part | |1 of | their |0 drill | |0 when | you |1 are | |1 in | |0 port | ."
"This |0 not | |0 only | |0 ensures | |1 the | |0 lifeboats | |1 are | |0 operational | |1 and | |1 will | |0 work | if |0 needed | , |1 but | |0 makes | |1 the | |0 crew | |0 proficient | at |0 launching | them ."
I |1 do | n't |0 think | |0 so |
|1 Do | n't |0 worry | .
|0 When | |1 was | |1 the | |0 last | |0 time | you |0 heard | about |1 a | |0 ship | |0 sinking | ?
|1 100 | |0 years | |0 ago | ?

I |1 'll | |1 be | |1 in | |0 Okinawa | |1 for | |0 about | |1 a | |0 week | |0 so | I |1 was | |0 wondering | what |1 are | |1 some | |0 fun | |0 things | I |1 could | |0 do | ?
I |1 'm | |1 a | |1 20 | |0 year | |0 old | |0 female | |0 travelling | |1 by | myself |0 so | it |1 could | |1 be | anything .
|1 Besides | |1 the | |0 obvious | |0 tourist | |0 spots | which I |0 already | |1 have | |0 planned | |1 for | .
|0 How | |1 is | |1 the | |0 night | |0 life | |1 in | |0 Naha | ?
"|0 Are | there |1 any | |0 good | |0 venues | that |0 showcase | |0 underground | |0 bands | , |1 or | |0 just | |1 a | |0 venue | |0 at | |0 all | ?"
It |1 does | n't |0 have | to |1 be | |0 underground | it |1 could | |1 be | |1 any | |0 type | |1 of | |0 music | .
|0 Thanks |
|1 The | |0 best | |0 thing | you |1 can | |0 do | |1 in | |0 Okinawa | |0 is | to |0 go | |1 to | |1 a | |0 beach | .
"|0 Otherwise | , you |1 can | |0 do | what you |1 can | |0 do | |1 in | |0 other | |0 parts | |1 or | |0 Japan | , |1 like | |0 shopping | , |0 eating | , etc ."
|1 Or | you |1 can | |0 visit | |0 temples | |1 or | |0 shrines | |1 in | |0 Okinawa | .
|0 Well | |0 first | you |1 can | |0 try | |0 speaking | |0 Japanese | .
|0 Go | |1 to | |1 a | |0 sumo | |0 tournament | .
|0 Eat | |1 at | |1 a | |0 conveyor | - |0 belt | |0 sushi | |0 restaurant | .
|0 Climb | |0 Mount | |0 Fuji | .
"|0 Okinawa | |1 is | |0 quite | |0 different | |1 from | |1 the | |0 rest | |1 of | |0 Japan | , although |0 of | |0 course | there |0 are | |0 similarities | ."
|1 The | |0 main | |0 thing | |0 people | |0 do | |0 there | |0 is | |0 go | |1 to | |1 the | |0 beach | .
"There |0 's | |1 the | |0 market | |1 in | |0 Naha | , which |1 is | |0 great | ."
"You |1 can | |0 find | |1 all | |0 sorts | |1 of | |0 fresh | |0 food | |1 and | |0 get | |1 a | |0 really | |0 delicious | , |0 fresh | |0 sashimi | / |0 sushi | |0 lunch | |0 upstairs | ."
|0 Try | |1 the | |0 local | |0 sake | |0 too | if you |1 can | .
It |1 's | |1 a | |0 special | |0 kind | .
I |1 'm | not |0 sure | that there |0 's | |0 much | |0 nightlife | |1 in | |0 Naha | .
"It |1 's | |0 more | |1 of | |1 a | |0 place | to |0 go | to |0 enjoy | |1 the | |0 weather | , |1 the | |0 sea | , etc ."
You |1 might | |0 have | to |0 make | your |0 own | |0 nightlife | by |0 finding | |1 an | |0 izakaya | ( |0 pub | ) |0 somewhere | .
Your |0 best | |0 bet | |1 would | |0 probably | |0 be | to |0 get | |1 a | |0 copy | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Lonely | |0 Planet | |0 Japan | |0 book | |1 and | |0 read | |1 the | |0 chapter | |1 on | |0 Okinawa | .
|0 Naha | |1 's | not |1 a | |0 very | |0 big | |0 city | .
|0 Modern | |0 m | |1 16 | |1 vs | |0 Vietnam | |0 m | |1 16 | |0 version | ?
"I |1 was | |0 playing | |1 a | |0 video | |0 game | that |0 has | |1 a | |0 m | |1 16 | |0 Vietnam | |0 model | , |1 and | |1 in | |1 the | |0 game | it |1 's | |1 3 | - |0 shot | |0 burst | ."
My |0 brother | |0 said | they |0 only | |0 had | |0 full | - |0 auto | |1 and | |0 semiautomatic | |1 during | |0 Vietnam | .
My |0 questions | |0 are | ..
1 ) what |1 the | |1 s | |0 difference | |1 between | |1 a | |0 modern | |0 m16 | |1 and | |0 Vietnam | |0 m | |1 16 | ?
2 ) |1 did | |0 Vietnam | |0 m | |0 16's | |0 have | |1 a | |1 3 | - |0 shot | |0 burst | |0 function | ?
To |0 save | |0 money | |0 Robert | |0 McNamara | |0 ordered | that |1 the | |0 ammunition | |1 for | |1 the | |0 new | |0 M | - |0 16s | |1 being | |0 sent | |1 to | |0 SEA | |1 in | |1 the | |0 early | |0 60s | |0 use | |1 an | |0 older | ( |0 dirtier | ) |0 type | |1 of | |0 gunpowder | |0 meant | |1 for | |0 use | |1 with | |1 the | |0 M | - |1 14 | .
He |0 also | |0 ordered | that |1 the | |0 receiver | |0 not | |0 get | |1 a | ( I |0 think | |0 chrome | ) |0 coating | that |0 helped | |0 keep | |1 the | |0 gun | from |0 jamming | .
"|0 Than | |1 the | |0 troops | |1 being | |0 issued | |1 the | |0 weapon | |1 were | |0 told | it |1 was | |0 self | - |0 cleaning | , |1 which | it |1 was | n't ."
|1 As | |1 a | |0 result | there |0 was | |1 a | |0 problem | with |1 the | |0 weapon | |0 jamming | .
Once |1 the | |0 troops | |0 started | |0 cleaning | |1 the | |0 weapon | |0 properly | ( |0 even | |1 with | |1 the | |0 dirtier | |0 powder | ) |1 the | |0 Vietnam | |0 era | |0 M | - |1 16 | |0 turned | |1 out | to |1 be | |1 a | |0 good | |0 weapon | |1 for | |1 the | |0 purpose | it |1 was | |1 being | |0 used | |1 for | .
|1 The | |0 screw | - |0 up | |1 was | |1 the | |0 kind | |1 of | |0 things | you |0 have | |0 happen | |0 when | you |0 have | |0 bean | - |0 counters | ( |1 and | |0 McNamara | |1 was | nothing if |0 not | |1 a | |0 bean | - |0 counter | ) |0 instead | |1 of | |0 soldiers | |1 in | |0 charge | |1 of | |1 the | |0 military | .
"|0 Today | 's |0 weapons | |1 do | not |0 have | |1 that | |0 kind | |1 of | |0 problem | , |1 and | |1 are | |0 much | |0 more | |0 reliable | ."
1 ) |0 modern | |0 m | |1 16 | |1 is | |0 alright | .
|0 Vietnam | |0 m | |1 16 | |0 used | to |0 clog | |1 up | |1 and | |0 never | |0 work | .
2 ) |1 All | |0 M | |0 16's | |1 are | |1 either | |0 automatic | |1 or | semi |0 automatic | .
|1 No | |0 one | |0 uses | |1 3 | |0 burst | .
you |0 play | |0 too | |0 much | |0 cod | ;P

"I |1 would | |0 say | it |0 really | |0 depends | |1 on | your |0 riding | |0 ability | , |1 what | |0 disciplines | you |1 are | |0 interested | in |0 doing | , |1 or | |0 plan | on |0 doing | , etc ."
|1 But | I |1 would | |0 go | |1 for | |1 the | |0 base | |0 number | |1 of | |1 15 | |0 hh | .
"It |1 's | "" |0 tall | "" |0 being | it |1 's | |0 bigger | |1 than | |1 a | |0 pony | , |1 but | it |1 's | |1 on | |1 the | |0 small | |0 end | |1 for | |1 a | |0 horse | ."
"I |0 got | my |0 horse | |0 when | I |1 was | |1 12 | |1 and | I |1 was | |0 already | |1 5 | |0 ' | |1 9 | - |1 5 | |0 ' | |1 10 | , |0 thankfully | I |0 stopped | |0 growing | |0 when | I |0 hit | |1 5 | |0 ' | |1 11 | |0 "" | |1 but | my |0 horse | |1 is | |1 about | |1 16.2 | |1 or | |1 16.3 | |0 hh | , |0 TB | ."

|1 A | |0 taller | |0 horse | |1 does | n't |0 always | |0 mean | |1 a | |0 horse | you |1 ca | n't |0 handle | .
|0 Keep | that |1 in | |0 mind | .

"You |0 just | |0 want | to |1 be | |0 sure | you |1 can | |0 groom | |1 and | |0 saddle | |0 sufficiently | |1 and | |1 the | |0 horse | itself |1 is | |0 calm | |0 enough | so that |1 whatever | |0 size | it |1 is | , you |1 can | |0 handle | it ."
"i |1 'm | |1 5 | |0 ' | |1 3 | - |1 4 | |0 "" | |1 and | |1 am | |1 21 | |0 well | |1 will | |1 be | |1 in | |0 Nov | |1 and | my |0 horse | |1 is | |1 14.2 | |0 hh | |1 and | she |1 's | |0 perfect | |0 size | |1 for | me i |1 can | |0 hop | |0 right | |0 on | |1 with | |1 no | |0 mounting | |0 block | ..... |0 only | |1 with | |1 a | |0 saddle | though |0 haha | i |1 ca | n't |0 bareback | , not |0 yet |"
If you |1 Do | n't |0 want | to |0 grow | |1 out | |1 of | it |0 quickly | |0 get | |1 a | |1 14 | |0 ' | |1 2 | ..
"Anything |0 smaller | you |1 will | |0 grow | |1 out | , anything |0 bigger | |1 will | |1 be | |0 too | |0 big | |1 and | |0 difficult | to |0 control | |1 and | |0 manage | , |0 especially | |0 when | |0 riding | ."

"I |1 do | |0 like | |1 the | |0 shadow | , |0 though | ."

what |1 are | |1 some | |0 unique | |0 customs | |1 in | |0 ireland | ?
|0 As | |0 far | ask I |1 ’m | |0 aware | our |0 most | |0 unique | |0 custom | |1 would | |1 be | |1 the | “ |0 Country | |0 Wake | ” .
|1 In | |1 all | my |0 travels | I |1 ’ve | |0 never | |0 seen | anything |1 like | it |1 and | |1 am | |0 often | |0 met | |1 with | |1 an | |0 odd | |0 look | |0 when | I |0 explain | them |1 to | |0 foreigners | .
"After |1 a | |0 person | |0 dies | , their |0 remains | |1 are | “ |0 waked | ” |1 in | their |0 home | |1 for | |0 roughly | |1 2 | - |1 3 | |0 days | ."
"|1 In | |1 this | |0 time | |0 visitors | |1 will | |0 come | |1 to | |1 the | |0 house | , |0 pay | their |0 respects | |1 to | |1 the | |0 desisted | |1 and | their |0 family | |1 and | |0 have | |1 a | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 cups | |1 of | |0 tea | |1 with | |1 a | |0 sandwich | |1 or | |1 a | |0 bun | ."
|1 The | |0 wake | |0 also | |0 included | |1 the | |0 night | |0 sit | |0 were | |0 friends | |1 and | |0 family | |0 sit | |1 up | |1 through | |1 the | |0 night | |1 with | |1 the | |0 remains | .
|0 Wakes | |1 are | |0 common | |1 both | |0 north | |1 and | |0 south | |1 of | |1 the | |0 boarder | |1 with | |0 Protestants | |1 and | |0 Catholics | |0 alike | .
|1 But | |0 only | |0 really | |1 in | |1 the | |0 countryside | .
"|1 The | |0 only | |0 notable | |0 difference | I |1 have | |0 noticed | |0 is | that |1 in | |1 the | |0 south | |1 of | |0 Ireland | |1 one | |0 night | |1 of | |1 the | |0 wake | |1 is | |0 often | |0 held | |1 in | |1 the | |0 chapel | |1 the | |0 night | |1 before | |1 the | |0 funeral | , |1 this | |0 tradition | |0 started | |1 after | |1 the | |0 civil | |0 war | ."
|1 Another | |0 unique | |0 custom | ( |1 and | |1 a | |0 dying | |0 one | |1 at | that ) |1 is | |1 the | |0 Pioneers | .
"|1 The | |0 Pioneers | |1 was | |1 an | |0 organization | |0 started | |1 at | |1 the | |0 end | |1 of | |1 the | |0 19th | |0 century | which |0 pushed | |1 and | |0 supported | |1 the | |0 ideal | |1 of | |0 temperance | ( |0 abstaining | |1 from | |0 alcohol | ) , |1 in | |1 an | |0 attempt | to |0 deal | |1 with | |1 the | |0 massive | |0 issue | |1 of | |0 alcoholism | that |0 Ireland | |1 was | |0 gripped | |1 by | ."
"|0 Pioneers | |0 take | |1 a | |0 pledge | to |0 remain | |0 tee | - |0 total | |1 and | |1 at | |1 the | |0 hight | |1 of | |1 the | |0 organization | |0 popularity | , |0 had | |1 an | |0 estimated | |1 two | |1 million | |0 members | |0 even | |0 filling | |0 Croke | |0 Park | |1 on | |1 the | |0 25th | |0 anniversary | ."
I my self |1 am | |1 one | |1 but | |0 appreciate | that |1 the | |0 organization | |1 is | |0 unlikely | to |0 make | |1 into | |1 the | |0 22nd | |0 century | .
|1 The | |0 Orange | |0 Order | |1 and | |1 the | |0 12th | |1 of | |0 July | |0 Marches | |1 would | |1 be | |0 argued | |1 by | |1 some | not to |1 be | |1 an | |0 Irish | |0 custom | |1 but | |0 unarguable | |0 ticks | |1 every | |0 criteria | to |1 be | |0 considered | |1 one | .
|1 The | |0 marches | |1 on | |1 the | |0 12th | |1 of | |0 July | |1 are | |0 only | |0 really | |0 attended | |1 by | |0 protestants | |1 in | |1 the | |0 Ulster | |1 but | |1 in | |0 spite | |1 of | the |1 are | |1 the | |0 largest | |0 attended | |0 paraded | |1 in | |0 Ireland | .

"I |1 'm | |0 unsure | |1 of | this , because |0 once | I |0 watched | |1 a | |0 commercial | |1 of | |0 cat | |0 food | |1 with | my |0 cat | |1 and | she |1 did | n't |0 react | to |0 seeing | |1 another | |0 cat | |1 on | |0 TV | ."

"|0 As | |0 far | as I |0 understand | , |1 this | |0 ad | |1 will | |0 get | |0 dogs | |0 excited | , |1 but | my |0 question | |0 is | : |1 Can | |0 dogs | |0 actually | |0 see | |1 the | |0 images | |0 featured | |1 in | |1 the | |0 advert | |1 like | |0 humans | ?"
"|0 Also | , |1 can | |0 animals | |0 remember | |0 images | |1 on | |0 TV | |1 like | us , |0 humans | ?"
"If |0 so | , |0 then | |1 does | that |0 mean | that if you |0 watched | |1 a | |0 scary | |0 movie | |1 and | your |0 dog | / |0 cat | / |0 parrot | |1 was | |1 in | |1 the | |0 same | |0 room | |1 as | you they |1 will | |0 also | |0 get | |0 scared | ?"
"I |1 would | n't |0 know | -- I |1 do | n't |0 particularly | |0 like | |0 scary | |0 movies | , |1 and | I |1 have | n't |0 tried | this |1 with | my |0 pet | ."
"|0 Although | , I |1 do | n't |0 think | that |0 scary | |0 movies | |1 will | |0 affect | |0 pets | |1 for | |1 a | |0 long | |0 time | ; I |1 am | |0 sure | they |1 'll | |0 forget | |0 sometime | -- |1 or | |1 am | I |0 wrong | ?"
|0 So | what |1 about | |0 T.V. | ?
|1 Do | |0 dogs | |0 enjoy | |0 watching | |0 T.V. | ?
"|0 Well | , |0 T.V. | |1 is | |1 a | |0 series | |1 of | |0 flickering | |0 pictures | that |1 are | |0 streamed | |0 together | to |0 make | |1 a | |0 moving | |0 picture | ."
"|1 The | |0 pictures | |1 are | |0 broadcast | |1 at | |1 a | |0 rate | |1 of | |0 about | |1 60 | |0 Hz | , which |1 is | |0 how | |0 fast | they |0 need | to |0 move | for us to |0 see | them |1 as | |1 a | |0 moving | , |0 flawless | |0 picture | ."
"|1 To | |1 a | |0 dog | , |0 watching | |0 T.V. | |1 is | |1 a | |0 lot | like |0 watching | |1 and | |0 old | |0 scratchy | |0 silent | |0 film | because their |0 flicker | |0 fusion | |0 seems | to |0 occur | |1 at | |1 a | |0 rate | |1 of | |1 70 | |1 to | |1 80 | |0 Hz | ."
|0 So | they |0 see | |1 the | |0 pictures | |0 flicker | |0 slower | |1 and | there |0 for | it |0 seems | |0 choppy | |1 to | them .
"|0 So | |0 chances | |0 are | that if your |0 dog | |0 likes | to |0 watch | |0 T.V. | , it |1 ’s | |0 probably | |1 because | |1 of | |1 the | |0 sounds | ."
"|0 Hearing | |1 is | |1 a | |0 dog | ’s |0 secondary | |0 sense | , |1 and | I |1 will | |0 discuss | that |1 in | |1 another | |0 blog | |0 entery | ."
|0 Yes | they |0 do | .
i |1 m | |0 pretty | |0 sure | that they |1 do | |0 see | |0 things | |1 on | |1 the | |0 tv | |0 screen | because my |0 cat | |0 chases | |0 things | |1 around | |1 the | |0 tv | |0 screen |
|0 How | |0 much | |1 should | I |1 be | |0 looking | |1 at | |1 for | |0 horse | |0 transportation | ?
"I |0 need | |1 one | |0 horse | |0 transported | |1 to | |0 shows | |1 throughout | |1 the | |1 2012 | |0 show | |0 season | , |1 and | |1 the | |0 location | |1 is | |0 about | |1 3 | |0 hours | |0 away | from |0 where | I |0 live | ."
"|1 The | |0 place | |0 where | I |1 'm | |0 boarding | |1 is | not |0 likely | to |0 want | to |0 take | me |0 this | |0 far | , |1 and | I |1 do | not |0 have | |1 any | |0 ways | of |0 hauling | him myself ."
|0 So | I |0 want | to |0 hire | someone ( |1 or | |0 multiple | |0 people | ) to |0 transport | me |1 to | |1 these | |0 shows | .
"If they |0 ask | |0 how | |0 much | I |1 'm | |0 willing | to |0 pay | , what |1 is | |1 a | |0 good | |0 price | |0 range | ?"
I |0 saw | |1 a | |0 site | that |0 charges | $ |1 0.70 | |1 per | |0 mile | .
|1 Is | that |0 reasonable | ?
"|0 Impossible | to |0 say | , |1 but | I |0 guess | you |1 would | |0 have | to |0 work | |1 out | |0 fuel | |0 consumption | |1 for | |1 the | |0 particular | |0 vehicle | that they |1 are | |0 using | |1 and | |0 pay | |1 a | |0 proportion | |1 of | that , |1 and | |1 some | |1 on | |0 top | |1 for | |1 the | |0 driver | 's |0 time | |1 and | |0 effort | , unless you |1 are | |0 able | to |0 share | |0 transport | |1 with | |1 another | |1 or | |0 more | , that |1 would | |0 keep | |1 the | |0 costs | |0 down | ."

"|0 However | , |1 in | |1 the | |0 day | |0 time | |1 would | it |1 be | |0 okay | for |1 the | |0 rabbit | to |0 hop | |0 around | |1 along | |1 with | |1 the | |0 chickens | ?"
"We |0 feed | |1 the | |0 chickens | |0 scraps | |1 of | |0 veggies | |1 and | |0 fruits | |1 throughout | |1 the | |0 day | , |1 but | it |1 's | nothing that |1 a | |0 rabbit | |1 would | n't |1 be | |0 able | to |0 digest | |0 just | |0 fine | ."
"|0 So | , |1 can | |0 rabbits | |1 and | |0 chickens | |0 live | |0 together | |0 as | |0 long | as they |0 have | |0 separate | |0 places | |1 for | their |0 food | |1 and | |0 water | ?"
"( |1 The | |0 rabbit | |0 hutch | |1 would | |0 have | |1 an | |0 opening | |0 only | |0 big | |0 enough | |1 for | |1 the | |0 rabbit | , |1 the | |0 chickens | |1 would | not |1 be | |0 able | to |0 get | |1 to | |1 the | |0 rabbit | |0 food | ) |0 Also | , |1 is | it |0 okay | if |1 the | |0 rabbit | |0 occasionally | |0 sneaks | |1 a | |0 few | |0 bites | |1 of | |0 chicken | |0 feed | ?"
"My |0 last | |0 rabbit | |0 did | that |1 a | |0 few | |0 times | , |1 and | he |1 was | |0 fine | ..."
I |0 just | |0 wan | na |0 make | |0 sure | :) |0 Thank | !
"|0 Yes | , |1 but | |1 be | |0 sure | that your |0 chickens | |1 are | |0 all | |0 hens | ( I |0 mean | |0 not | |0 roosters | ) , |0 Roosters | |1 may | |0 attack | |0 rabbits | |1 or | anything they |0 see | |0 moving | , |0 so | |1 be | |0 aware | |1 of | that , |0 hens | |1 are | |0 friendly | |1 with | |0 almost | |1 all | |0 kinds | |1 of | |0 pets | !"
"|1 From | my |0 experience | |0 Hens | ( |1 Not | |0 roosters | ) |1 are | |0 very | |0 friendly | |1 with | |0 duck | , |0 Guinea | |0 pigs | , |0 kittens | , |0 cows | , |0 Rabbits | , etc ."
|1 Be | |0 sure | |0 not | to |0 feed | your |0 rabbits | |0 non-veg | |0 items | !
"You |0 said | they |0 live | |1 in | |0 different | |0 cages | |1 and | they |1 are | |0 free | |1 in | |0 day | , |0 so | |1 no | |0 problem | , |1 do | n't |0 put | |1 both | |1 of | them |1 in | |1 one | |0 cage | because |0 rabbits | |0 bedding | |1 is | |0 different | |1 than | that |1 of | |0 hens | , |0 wet | |0 bedding | |1 can | |0 cause | |0 diseases | |1 in | them !"
"|0 So | , |1 do | n't |0 put | |1 both | |1 of | them |1 in | |1 one | |0 cage | ."
|0 Good | |0 luck | !
|0 yea | i |0 guess | |1 but | |0 rabbits | |1 a | |0 easily | |0 escape | |1 a | |0 pen | |1 or | |1 another | |0 rabbit | |1 could | |0 get | |1 in | |0 there | |1 and | |1 that | |0 rabbit | |1 could | |1 be | |1 the | |0 opposite | |0 gender | .
|0 So | |1 be | |0 very | |0 careful | |1 and | |1 some | |0 feeds | |1 could | |1 be | |0 toxic | |1 to | |0 rabbits | |1 and | |0 safe | |1 for | |0 chickens | .
|0 Rabbits | |1 do | |0 burrow | |0 also | |0 so | |1 do | n't |1 be | |0 surprised | if |0 chicken | |1 are | |0 falling | |1 into | |0 holes | .
|0 rabbits | |1 are | |0 delicate | |1 and | |1 can | |0 get | |0 diseases | |0 so | |0 watch | |1 out | |1 for | that .
|0 melting | |0 brass | |1 did | not |0 work | ?
my |0 friends | |1 and | I |1 are | |0 trying | to |0 melt | |0 bras | to |0 make | |1 some | |0 little | |0 figures | .
"we |1 have | |0 made | |1 a | |0 furnace | |1 as | |0 such | , we |0 took | |1 a | |0 clay | |0 flower | |0 pot | |1 with | |1 a | |0 hole | |1 in | |1 the | |0 bottom | |0 put | |1 a | |0 piece | |1 of | |0 steel | |0 pipe | |1 in | |1 the | |0 middle | |1 of | it |1 with | |1 a | |0 cap | |1 on | |1 the | |0 bottom | , |0 filled | |1 the | |0 pipe | |1 with | |0 brass | |0 scrap | , |0 surounded | |1 the | |0 pipe | |1 with | |0 charcoal | |0 lit | it |1 off | |1 and | |0 pumped | |0 air | |1 through | |1 the | |0 hole | |1 in | |1 the | |0 pot | , everything |0 got | |0 red | |0 hot | |1 but | |1 did | not |0 melt | ."
what |1 am | I |0 doing | |0 wrong |
"I |1 would | |0 recommend | to |0 start | |1 with | something |0 more | |0 simple | |1 like | |0 tin | , |0 pewter | , |0 aluminum | |1 or | |0 zinc | , they |1 all | |0 have | |1 a | |0 much | |0 more | |0 reasonable | |0 melting | |0 point | ."
I |1 'll | |0 just | |0 echo | |1 both | |0 other | |0 answers | .
|0 Molten | |0 brass | |1 is | |0 damn | |0 hot | |1 and | |0 usually | it |1 's | |0 pressurized | |0 gas | |1 and | |0 forced | |0 air | |1 or | |0 oxygen | .
"|0 Even | if you |1 did | |0 melt | it , I |0 doubt | you |0 foresaw | |1 the | |0 issues | of |0 handling | it |1 and | |0 pouring | it ."

|0 Brass | |0 has | |1 an | |0 even | |0 higher | |0 melting | |0 point | |1 than | |0 bronze | |1 and | I |1 would | |0 think | your |0 charcoal | |0 just | |1 does | n't |0 get | |0 hot | |0 enough | .

"I |1 have | |0 done | |1 a | |0 fair | |0 amount | |1 of | |0 metal | |0 casting | , |1 but | |0 never | |0 tried | to |0 build | my |0 own | |0 furnace | , |1 but | I |0 think | your |0 version | |1 is | |0 just | |0 too | |0 small | |1 and | |1 does | n't |0 get | |0 hot | |0 enough | ."
"I |1 have | |0 melted | |0 small | |0 amounts | |1 of | |0 bronze | |1 in | |1 a | |0 crucible | |1 with | |1 a | |0 large | |0 propane | |0 torch | ( |0 much | |0 larger | |1 than | |1 the | |0 plumbers | |0 torch | , |1 but | it |1 can | |1 be | |0 run | |1 of | |1 those | |0 propane | |0 cylinders | you |1 can | |0 buy | |1 for | |1 a | |0 gas | |0 grill | ) ."

|1 Should | |1 all | |0 UK | |0 towns | |1 and | their |0 cafes | |1 or | |0 restaurants | |0 provide | |0 Halal | |0 food | ?
|1 Some | |0 friends | |1 of | mine |0 visited | |0 Dartmouth | |1 in | |0 Devon | whilst |1 on | |0 holiday | |0 last | |0 summer | .

It |1 s | |0 important | |1 to | their |0 religion | that they |0 only | |0 consume | |0 Halal | |0 food | .
"|0 Even | if you |0 buy | |1 a | |0 cake | |1 in | |1 a | |0 baker | s you |1 can | not |1 be | |0 too | what |0 happens | |1 in | |1 the | |0 kitchen | , |1 for | |0 example | |1 the | |0 cake | |1 may | |1 have | |1 been | |0 sliced | |0 using | |1 a | |0 knife | |0 used | for |0 preparing | |0 ham | ."
"It |1 s | |0 simply | not |0 just | |1 a | |0 case | of |0 avoiding | |0 pork | , |0 alcohol | |1 and | |0 only | |1 being | |0 allowed | to |0 eat | |0 halal | |0 prepared | |0 meat | , |1 but | |1 the | |0 kitchen | |1 and | its |0 utensils | |1 should | not |1 have | |1 been | |0 used | |1 for | |0 prohibited | |0 foods | ."
|0 Places | |1 like | |0 Dartmouth | |1 are | |0 supposed | to |1 be | |0 tourist | |0 towns | |1 and | |1 should | |0 provide | |0 foods | |1 for | |0 people | |1 of | |1 all | |0 religions | .

|0 Lay | |1 some | |0 knowledge | |1 on | them |0 dude | .
|0 Maybe | if they |0 see | |0 how | |0 much | |0 time | |1 and | |0 effort | you |1 've | |0 devoted | to |0 researching | |1 the | |0 animal | they |1 'll | |0 reconsider | .
|0 Tell | them it |0 costs | |1 like | |1 8 | |0 dollars | |1 a | |0 month | ( if |0 even | |1 that | |0 much | ) to |0 keep | it |0 fed | .
|1 Be | |0 helpful | |1 around | |1 the | |0 house | to |0 show | that |0 even | if you |1 ca | n't |0 pay | |1 for | it yourself that you |1 re | |0 willing | to |0 work | |1 for | it .

|0 LIKE | |0 SERIOUSLY | !! >:(
|0 Best | |0 answer | |1 shall | |0 receive | |0 points | :)
"iw |1 ould | |0 just | |0 stick | him |1 in | |1 the | |0 tank | |1 and | |0 let | your |0 snake | |0 have | |1 a | |0 nice | |0 hunt | |1 for | |0 once | , |0 snakes | |0 jaws | |0 detach | |1 for | |1 this | |0 sort | |1 of | |1 this | |0 thing | , |0 so | |0 why | not |0 give | her |1 a | |0 good | |0 hunt | , |1 but | if you |1 do | |0 want | him |0 knock | him i |1 d | |0 just | |0 throw | him |1 against | |1 the | |0 wall | |1 or | something ,, |0 lol | i |1 do | nt |0 know | , i |0 agree | |1 with | you |0 though | |0 throw | him , |0 haha |"
"|0 Ok | |0 so | if youre |0 snake | |1 will | |0 take | |0 pre-killed | , you |1 can | "" |0 gas | it "" ."
|0 Just | |0 put | |1 the | |0 rat | |1 in | |1 a | |0 sealed | |0 tupperwear | |0 container | |1 with | |1 no | |0 airholes | |1 and | |0 wait | until it |0 passes | |1 out | |1 and | |0 dies | |1 and | |0 then | |0 feed | it .
"If it |1 wo | n't |0 take | |0 pre-killed | |1 and | you |0 usually | |0 feed | |0 live | |0 then | you |1 could | |0 hold | |1 the | |0 rat | |1 by | |1 the | |0 tail | |1 and | |0 whack | it |1 against | |1 a | |0 hard | |0 surface | , |1 like | |1 a | |0 refrigerator | |1 or | |0 wall | ."
I |1 do | n't |0 like | |1 that | |0 option | |0 though | - I |0 think | it |1 's | |0 pretty | |0 cruel | |1 and | I'd |0 not | |0 done | |0 properly | you |1 'll | |0 end | |1 up | |0 really | |0 hurting | |1 the | |0 rat | |1 but | not |0 stunning | him |0 enough | to |0 stop | |0 possible | |0 injury | |1 to | your |0 snake | .
I |1 would | |0 do | |1 the | |0 tupperwear | |0 idea | |0 TBH | - |0 easiest | |1 and | |0 most | |0 humane | .
"You |1 could | |0 also | |0 just | |0 wait | until |1 the | |0 rat | |0 passes | |1 out | |1 for | |0 about | |1 1 | |0 minute | |1 and | |0 them | |0 feed | it - |1 at | |1 this | |0 point | , it |1 could | |0 still | |0 have | |1 a | |0 bit | |1 of | |1 a | |0 heart | |0 beat | |1 and | |1 be | |0 slightly | |0 still | |0 alive | ."
|1 And | |0 also | |0 maybe | |0 try | |0 holding | |1 the | |0 rat | |1 in | |0 feeding | |0 prongs | so your |0 snake | |1 can | |0 get | |1 a | |0 good | |0 hold | |1 and | |0 grip | |1 on | his |0 prey | .
|0 Good | |0 luck | !
|0 Just | my |0 opinion | |0 here | - |1 no | |0 judgement | - |0 getting | your |0 snake | |1 on | |0 frozen | / |0 thawed | |1 will | |0 prove | to |1 be | |0 much | |0 easier | |1 for | you |1 and | |0 safer | |1 for | your |0 snake | |1 in | |1 the | |0 long | |0 run | .
My |0 opinion | - |0 take | it for what it |1 's | |0 worth | … :-)

|0 How | to |0 train | my |0 puppy | ?
I |0 have | |1 a | |1 4 | |0 months | |0 Shih | |0 Tzu | |0 puppy | .
|0 Recently | I |1 'm | |0 having | |0 trouble | |0 training | him .
"He |1 is | |0 kind | |0 of | |0 hate | |0 walking | |1 with | |0 leash | , |1 every | |0 time | I |0 put | |1 the | |0 leash | |1 on | , he |1 will | |0 try | to |0 bite | it ."
|1 And | he |1 is | not |0 following | me |0 when | I |1 was | |0 walking | .
"I |0 saw | |0 lots | |1 of | |0 videos | |1 about | this , |1 but | |0 actually | it |1 did | n't |0 help | ."
|0 Is | there |1 any | |0 way | |1 can | |0 let | him |0 know | |0 how | to |0 walk | |1 with | |0 leash | ?
"|1 And | |1 every | |0 time | he |0 see | some |0 one | he |1 will | |0 rush | |1 to | |0 people | |1 and | |0 jump | |1 on | them , |1 does | n't |0 listen | |1 to | me ."
He |1 is | |0 really | |0 excited | |1 about | anybody he |0 see | .
|0 How | to |0 prevent | this ?
"|0 Last | |0 thing | |0 is | |1 every | |0 time | I |0 sit | |1 on | |1 a | |0 chair | |1 or | something |0 higher | |1 than | him , he |1 will | |0 try | to |0 jump | |0 on | , if he |1 ca | n't , he |1 will | |0 bark | |1 all | |1 the | |0 time | until I |0 let | him |0 get | |0 on | , what |1 should | I |0 do | |1 with | this ?"
Anyone |0 have | |1 any | |0 suggestion | ?
|0 thank | you |0 very | |0 much | .
"|0 Hi | , I |1 am | |1 a | |0 dog | |0 trainer | |1 for | |1 25 | |0 yrs | ."
You |0 need | to |0 purchase | what |1 is | |0 called | |1 a | |0 shoulder | |0 point | |0 harness | .
|1 This | |0 type | |1 of | |0 harness | |0 goes | |1 around | |1 the | |0 dog | s |0 chest | |1 and | |0 legs | |1 and | |0 has | |1 a | |0 clip | |1 for | |1 the | |0 leash | |0 up | |1 on | |1 the | |0 back | |1 of | |1 the | |0 dog | |1 in | |0 middle | |1 of | |0 shoulder | |0 blades | .
"|1 This | |0 way | , he |1 can | not |0 reach | |1 the | |0 leash | to |0 chew | it ."
"|0 When | he |0 swivels | his |0 head | to |0 go | |1 for | it |0 anyway | , |0 tell | him |0 sharp | "" |0 UH | |0 UH | "" |0 gently | |0 correct | him |1 with | |1 a | |0 small | |0 tug | |1 and | |0 continue | your |0 walk | ."
|0 Do | this |0 repeatedly | |1 and | |0 frequently | |1 and | he |1 will | |0 learn | to |0 walk | |1 on | |1 a | |0 leash | .
|0 Patience | |1 is | |1 the | |0 key | |0 here | .
He |1 is | |1 a | |0 young | |0 pup | |1 and | |1 will | |0 learn | |1 over | |0 time | |1 and | |0 consistency | |1 in | his |0 training | .
"|1 And | |0 always | , |0 always | |0 train | |1 with | |0 love | |1 and | |0 positive | |0 methods | - |0 never | |0 hit | |1 or | |0 harshly | |0 scold | ."
|0 Never | |0 train | |1 out | |1 of | |0 fear | .
"You |0 want | your |0 dog | to |0 admire | you |1 as | his |0 pack | |0 leader | , not |0 fear | you ."
|0 Good | |0 luck | |1 with | your |0 puppy | !
|1 All | |1 the | |0 best | .
|0 Put | him |1 in | |0 dog | |0 obedience | |0 school | |1 or | |0 call | |1 a | |0 professional | |0 dog | |0 trainer | . :)
|0 why | |1 do | nt you |0 get | |1 some | |0 treats | that he |0 loves | |1 and | |0 only | |0 give | him them |0 when | he |0 does | something |0 right | .
"|1 or | , as i |0 saw | |1 on | |0 embarrassing | |0 pets | |1 on | |0 tv | , |0 get | |1 a | |0 clicker | |0 type | |0 thing | |1 and | |0 treats | |0 as | |0 well | ."
"|0 try | to |0 train | him to |0 heel | , which |0 means | to |0 walk | |1 round | you before he |0 needs | to |0 go | |1 on | |1 a | |0 leash | , |1 and | he |1 may | |0 do | that ."
"|1 or | you |1 could | |0 even | |0 spray | |1 some | |0 scented | |0 spray | |1 on | |1 the | |0 leash | |1 and | he |1 will | |0 go | |1 for | |1 the | |0 scent | |1 and | |0 probably | , if you |0 act | |0 quick | |0 enough | , |1 will | |0 stay | |1 on | |1 the | |0 leash | ."
|1 What | |0 sort | |1 of | |0 Hotel | |1 could | I |0 expect | to |0 find | |1 in | |0 New | |0 Delhi | / |0 Agra | / |0 Varanasi | |1 for | rs |1 500 | |1 per | |0 night | ?
|0 Hey | |0 guys | .

|1 which | |1 one | |1 out | |1 of | these |0 makes | |1 the | |0 best | |0 pet | ?
"|1 a | |0 degu | , |1 a | |0 rat | , |1 a | |0 mouse | , |1 a | |0 hamster | |1 or | |1 a | |0 guinea | |0 pig | ?"
|1 and | |0 why | |1 is | |1 the | |1 one | |1 a | |0 better | |0 pet | ?
|0 Get | |1 a | |0 guinea | |0 pig | .
"I |0 have | |1 a | |0 hamster | , |1 and | |0 mice | |1 and | |0 rats | |0 like | to |0 escape | ."
"|1 The | |0 Guinea | |0 pig | |1 is | |0 better | because it |1 s | |1 a | |0 lot | |0 larger | |1 than | |1 a | |0 hamster | , |0 rat | , |0 mouse | , |1 or | |0 degu | ."
"|0 So | if you |0 lose | him , he |1 is | |0 easier | to |0 find | , because |0 smaller | |0 rodents | |0 just | |0 LOVE | to |0 escape | |1 from | their |0 cages | ."
|0 So | my |0 opinion | |1 is | |0 Guinea | |0 pigs | .
( |1 plus | they |1 do | nt |0 stink | |0 that | |0 bad | )
"|0 Depends | on what you |0 want | |1 in | |1 a | |0 pet | , to |1 be | |0 honest | ."
"|0 Also | |0 depends | |1 on | |1 the | |0 space | you |0 have | , |0 how | |0 much | |0 time | you |1 can | |0 handle | |1 the | |0 pet | , |0 how | |0 much | |0 money | you |1 can | |0 spend | , etc ."
I |1 've | |0 had | |0 experience | |1 with | |1 all | |1 of | |1 those | |0 pets | |1 except | |0 Degus | .
My |0 favorite | |1 would | |0 have | to |1 be | |1 the | |0 rat | .
"They |1 're | |0 incredibly | |0 social | , |0 highly | |0 trainable | , |1 and | |0 very | |0 clean | ."
"Mine |0 learned | to "" |0 go | |1 to | |1 the | |0 bathroom | "" |0 only | |1 in | their |0 cages | |1 and | |0 loved | to |0 ride | |1 on | my |0 shoulder | |1 or | |0 hang | |1 out | |1 in | my |0 hoodie | |0 pouch | ."
|1 The | |0 only | |0 downside | |0 is | they |1 should | |1 be | |0 kept | |1 in | |0 pairs | |1 or | |0 trios | |1 and | |0 require | |1 a | |0 pretty | |0 large | |0 habitat | .
"That |0 means | |0 expense | , |0 space | , |1 and | they |0 require | |0 weekly | |0 cage | |0 cleaning | ."
My |0 second | |0 favorite | |1 would | |0 have | to |1 be | |1 the | |0 Guinea | |0 Pig | - |0 not | |0 quite | |0 as | |0 social | |1 with | |0 people | |1 as | |0 rats | ( |0 at | |0 least | mine |1 was | n't ) |1 but | |0 more | |0 so | |1 than | |0 most | |0 hamsters | |1 or | |0 mice | .
"|0 Again | , |0 pairs | |1 or | |0 trios | |1 and | |0 pretty | |0 big | |0 living | |0 space | ."
"They , |0 too | , |0 need | |0 weekly | |0 cage | |0 cleaning | |1 and | |1 can | |0 cost | |1 quite | |1 a | |0 bit | ."
"I |1 could | |0 handle | my |0 mice | , |1 but | they |0 where | |0 skittish | |1 and | |0 preferred | their |0 cage | ."
I |1 've | |0 never | |0 met | |1 a | |0 hamster | that |1 did | n't |0 bite | me .
|0 Never | |0 had | / |0 handled | |1 a | |0 Degu | .
|0 Get | |1 a | |0 guinea | |0 pig | .
We |0 have | |1 two | .
They |1 are | |0 social | |1 and | |0 like | to |1 be | |0 handled | .
You |0 have | to |0 have | |1 two | because they |1 do | n't |0 do | |0 well | |0 alone | .
|0 Make | |0 certain | you |0 get | |1 two | |0 females | .
|1 Two | |0 males | |1 can | |0 fight | |1 and | you |0 definitely | |1 do | n't |0 want | |0 babies | !!
|0 Guinea | |0 pigs | ( |0 also | |0 called | |0 cavies | ) |1 are | |0 gentle | |0 creatures | |1 and | |1 are | |0 awake | |1 during | |1 the | |0 day | |1 and | |0 sleep | |1 at | |0 night | .
They |1 will | |0 whistle | |0 when | they |0 hear | you |1 as | |1 an | |0 encouragement | for you to |0 give | them |1 a | |0 treat | |1 like | |0 leaf | |0 lettuce | .
"They |0 love | |0 leaf | |1 or | |0 romaine | |0 lettuce | |1 and | |0 tomatos | , |0 celery | , |0 cucumbers | , |0 carrots | ."
"|1 Do | n't |0 feed | them |0 broccoli | , |0 cauliflower | , |0 garlic | , |0 onions | , |0 head | |0 lettuce | .... they |1 are | |0 all | |0 too | |0 difficult | for them to |0 digest | ."
"|0 Also | they |1 ca | n't |0 eat | |0 potatos | , they |1 are | |0 toxic | |1 for | them ."
"If you |0 keep | |1 the | |0 cage | |0 clean | they |1 do | n't |0 smell | |1 and | you |1 can | |0 buy | |0 spray | |1 on | |0 cleaser | |1 for | them , |0 just | |0 massage | it |1 into | their |0 coat | |1 and | |0 groom | them ."
|0 Fostering | |1 6 | |0 week | |0 old | |0 kittens | |1 and | |0 HATING | IT !
|0 Need | |0 Advice | !?
"I |0 wanted | to |0 volunteer | |1 and | |0 help | |0 animals | , |1 and | |0 decided | to |0 try | |0 fostering | |0 kittens | ."
This |1 is | my |0 first | |0 experience | |1 and | I |0 have | |1 two | |1 six | |0 week | |0 old | |0 kittens | |0 right | |0 now | |1 and | |1 am | |1 at | my |0 wit | s |0 end | .
I |1 do | not |0 want | to |0 have | to |0 bring | them |1 back | before they |1 are | |1 eight | |0 weeks | |0 old | |1 but | they |1 are | |0 ruining | my |0 apartment | .
"They |0 track | |0 poop | |0 everywhere | ( |0 most | |0 disgustingly | my |0 bed | .... ) , |1 and | |1 am | |0 constantly | |0 trying | to |0 climb | |0 up | everything , |0 including | my |0 bare | |0 legs | !"
My |0 legs | |1 and | |0 hands | |1 are | |0 just | |0 full | |1 of | |0 scratches | .
"I |0 realize | they |1 are | |0 young | |1 and | that |0 cats | |1 do | |0 climb | , |1 but | this |1 is | |0 just | |0 ridiculous | ."
My |0 apartment | |0 also | |0 smells | |0 repulsive | |0 even | though I |1 am | |0 cleaning | |1 out | their |0 litter | |0 box | |0 at | |0 least | |0 once | |1 a | |0 day | if |0 not | |0 twice | .
|1 Any | |0 suggestions | |1 and | |0 helpful | |0 hints | to |0 make | this |1 a | |0 more | |0 positive | |0 experience | |1 would | |1 be | |0 extremely | |0 appreciated | .
That |1 's | |0 kind | |0 of | |1 the | |0 way | it |0 goes | .. |0 lol | .
|0 Limit | them |1 to | |1 one | |0 room | |1 with | |0 easy | to |0 clean | |0 flooring | .
"If you |0 have | |0 limited | |0 options | , |0 try | |1 the | |0 bathroom | ."
|0 Make | |0 sure | there |0 are | |0 plenty | |1 of | |0 litter | |0 boxes | that |1 are | |0 cleaned | |0 often | .
"|0 Depending | |1 on | |1 the | |0 batch | |1 of | |0 kittens | , I |1 will | |0 often | |0 have | |0 as | |0 many | |1 as | |1 one | |1 per | |0 kitten | ."
They |1 can | |0 produce | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | |0 waste | |1 and | |0 even | |0 scooping | |0 twice | |1 a | |0 day | they |1 can | |0 get | |0 messy | .
|1 For | |1 some | |0 reason | it |0 takes | them |0 awhile | to |0 learn | |0 not | to |0 step | |1 in | |0 poop | .
"|0 Also | if they |0 have | |0 diarrhea | , |0 check | |1 in | |1 with | your |0 foster | |0 coordinator | ."
They |1 made | |0 need | |0 medication | |1 or | |0 deworming | |1 or | something .
They |1 are | |0 testing | |1 out | their |0 claws | |1 and | |0 teeth | .
|1 To | |1 some | |0 degree | you |1 can | / |1 should | |0 help | |0 teach | them |0 not | to |0 use | their |0 teeth | |1 and | |0 claws | |0 inappropriately | .
"|1 But | |1 in | |1 the | |0 meantime | , |0 highly | |0 recommend | |0 jeans | |1 and | |0 long | |0 sleeves | |0 anytime | you |1 'll | |1 be | |0 interacting | |1 with | |1 the | |0 kittens | ."
|0 Then | |0 take | |0 care | |1 of | yourself .
|0 Get | |0 plenty | |1 of | |0 sleep | |1 and | |0 make | |0 sure | you |0 take | |0 time | |0 out | to |0 do | |1 some | |0 things | you |0 enjoy | .
|0 Try | |0 visiting | |1 the | |0 kittens | |1 a | |0 few | |0 times | |1 a | |0 day | |1 for | |0 short | |0 periods | |1 of | |0 time | .
|0 Try | to |0 go | |1 in | |0 there | |1 with | |1 the | |0 right | |0 frame | |1 of | |0 mind | |1 and | |0 enjoy | them for what they |0 are | .
"If you |0 still | |1 do | n't |0 enjoy | |1 the | |0 kittens | , |0 see | |1 what | |0 other | |0 opportunities | |1 are | |0 available | ."
"They |1 may | |0 need | |0 foster | |0 homes | |1 for | |0 adult | |0 cats | |1 in | |0 different | |0 situations | .. |0 sick | , |0 recovering | |1 from | |0 surgery | , |0 need | |1 a | |0 little | |0 socialization | , etc ."
I |0 find | |1 the | |0 adults | |1 are | |0 much | |0 easier | .
"|0 Generally | they |1 're | not |0 clawing | |1 and | |0 biting | , they |1 do | n't |0 make | |0 nearly | |0 as | |0 much | |0 mess | , they |1 do | n't |0 need | |0 nearly | |0 as | |0 much | |0 litterbox | |0 scooping | , etc :)"
|0 Decide | |0 volunteering | |1 is | not your |0 thing | |1 and | |0 give | them |1 back | !
|1 And | |0 do | |0 more | |0 research | before you |0 agree | |0 next | |0 time | ;-)
|0 Take | |1 the | |0 kittens | |0 back | |1 to | |1 the | |0 shelter | .
"|0 Maybe | |0 do | |0 volunteer | |0 work | |1 at | |1 the | |0 humane | |0 society | , |0 walk | |0 dogs | , |0 groom | |1 the | |0 animals | etc ."

"|1 Two | |0 years | |0 later | |0 when | I |0 got | |0 around | to |0 filling | |1 for | his |0 birth | |0 certificate | , I |0 find | |1 out | he |1 was | |0 never | |0 registered | ."
"I |0 had | to |0 call | |1 the | |0 Office | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Registrar | |0 General | |1 in | |0 Thunder | |0 Bay | , |0 have | |0 copies | |1 of | |1 the | |0 delayed | |0 registration | |0 form | |0 mailed | |0 out | |1 to | me , as they |1 do | n't |0 have | |1 an | |0 online | |0 area | |1 for | it |0 yet | , |0 fill | those |1 out | , |0 send | them |0 away | , |0 then | |0 apply | |1 for | his |0 birth | |0 certificate | ."
"If you |1 are | |0 just | |0 applying | |1 for | |1 a | |0 birth | |0 certificate | |1 for | |1 the | |0 first | |0 time | , it |1 s | |0 simple | to |0 do | it |1 over | |1 the | |0 computer | ."
|1 For | $ |1 56 | you |1 can | |0 even | |0 have | it |0 expedited | |1 and | |1 will | |0 get | |1 in | |1 three | |0 business | |0 days | |1 or | your |0 money | |0 back | .
"This |1 is | |1 in | |0 Ontario | |0 of | |0 course | , |1 the | |0 rates | |1 may | |1 be | |0 slightly | |0 different | |1 for | |0 other | |0 provinces | / |0 territories | ."
"You |0 just | |0 need | |0 basic | |0 information | , |1 and | |0 answer | |1 a | |0 few | |0 questions | |1 like | |1 what | |0 hospital | |1 was | |1 the | |0 child | |0 born | |1 at | / who |1 was | |1 the | |0 doctor | ...."
"|0 None | , |0 just | |0 walk | in |1 to | |1 the | |0 service | |0 office | |1 and | |0 present | |1 all | |1 the | |0 identification | you |0 have | to |0 prove | your |0 identity | ."
"they |1 may | |0 then | |0 chose | to |0 ask | you to |0 bring | |0 more | |0 evidence | , |1 or | |0 just | |0 look | |1 up | |1 the | |0 record | |1 and | |0 hand | you |1 the | |0 certificate | ."
You |1 can | |0 probably | |0 do | it |1 all | |0 on | - |0 line | .
|0 Start | |0 here | if you |1 were | |0 born | |1 in | |0 Ontario | .

"If you |1 were | |0 born | |0 elsewhere | , |0 start | |0 here | ."

|0 Good | |0 luck |
My |0 parents | |1 did | n't |0 send | |1 for | my |0 birth | |0 certificate | until I |1 was | |1 16 | |1 and | |0 needed | it |1 for | |0 summer | |0 employment | .
It |1 was | |1 no | |0 problem | to |0 get | |0 PROVIDED | |1 the | |0 birth | |1 was | |0 registered | |1 in | |1 the | |0 first | |0 place | .
I |0 add | that |0 in | because there |1 have | |0 been | |1 some | |0 people | who |1 have | |0 tried | to |0 claim | |0 citizenship | by |0 sending | |1 for | their |0 birth | |0 certificate | |0 when | they |1 were | |0 never | |0 really | |0 born | |1 in | |0 Canada | |1 or | |1 to | |0 Canadian | |0 parents | .
|0 When | |1 a | |0 child | |1 is | |0 born | |1 in | |0 Canada | |1 the | |0 birth | |1 is | |0 registered | before |1 the | |0 baby | |1 can | |0 leave | |1 the | |0 hospital | .
|0 As | |0 long | as that |1 was | |0 done | you |1 can | |0 send | |1 for | it |1 at | |1 any | |0 time | .
|1 Each | |0 provincial | |0 government | |0 has | |1 a | |0 website | that |0 lists | |1 the | |0 process | |1 for | |1 that | |0 Province | |0 so | |0 depending | upon |0 where | you |1 were | |0 born | you |1 can | |0 google | it .

|0 Carnival | |1 and | |0 Royal | |0 Caribbean | |1 are | |1 two | |0 popular | |0 cruise | |0 lines | that |0 have | |0 strong | |0 followings | .
|1 Some | |0 cruise | |0 aficionados | |0 refuse | to |0 sail | |1 on | |1 one | |1 or | |1 the | |0 other | .
|0 Are | there |1 any | |0 major | |0 differences | |1 between | them ?
|0 Explore | |1 which | |0 cruise | |1 may | |0 fit | your |0 needs | |1 the | |0 best | .
|1 For | our |0 comparison | we |0 sailed | |1 on | |1 two | |0 similar | |0 ships | - |1 the | |0 Carnival | |0 Liberty | |1 and | |1 the | |0 Royal | |0 Caribbean | |0 Mariner | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Seas | .
"|0 Itinerary | |1 Both | |0 ships | |0 go | |1 to | |0 Caribbean | |0 Islands | |1 like | |0 Jamaica | , |0 Grand | |0 Cayman | , |0 Cozumel | , |0 St. | |0 Thomas | , |1 the | |0 Bahamas | |1 and | |0 St. | |0 Martin | / |0 St. | |0 Maarten | ."
"|1 The | |0 Liberty | |0 also | |0 visited | its |0 private | |0 island | |0 Half | |0 Moon | |0 Cay | , |0 Puerto | |0 Rico | , |1 and | |0 Grand | |0 Turk | ."
|1 The | |0 Mariner | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Seas | |0 traveled | |1 to | its |0 private | |0 island | |0 Coco | |0 Cay | |1 and | |0 Labadee | ( |1 the | |0 north | |0 coast | |1 of | |0 Haiti | ) .
We |0 loved | |0 most | |1 of | |1 the | |0 locations | that |1 both | |1 of | |1 the | |0 ships | |0 visited | |1 and | |1 do | n't |0 believe | that this |1 should | |1 be | |1 a | |0 distinguishing | |0 factor | on |0 deciding | |1 between | |1 the | |0 cruise | |0 lines | .
|0 Shows | |1 Each | |0 night | there |0 are | |1 a | |0 variety | |1 of | |0 shows | .
|0 Usually | you |0 have | |1 the | |0 main | |0 show | |1 and | |1 some | |0 type | |1 of | |0 entertainment | |0 before | |1 and | |0 perhaps | |0 afterward | .
We |0 felt | that |1 the | |0 main | |0 shows | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Mariner | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Seas | |1 were | |0 better | .
|1 On | |1 the | |0 Liberty | we |0 liked | |1 the | |0 comedian | |1 and | |0 juggling | |0 act | .
"If you |0 love | |0 seeing | |1 the | |0 shows | , |0 Royal | |0 Caribbean | |1 was | |0 better | |1 for | |1 the | |0 main | |0 shows | |1 and | |0 Carnival | |1 was | |0 slightly | |0 better | |1 for | |1 the | |0 comedians | ."
|0 Dining | |0 Room | We |0 enjoyed | |1 the | |0 atmosphere | |1 of | |1 both | |0 dining | |0 rooms | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Liberty | |1 and | |0 Mariner | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Seas | .
We |0 felt | that |1 the | |0 menu | |0 had | |1 a | |0 little | |0 more | |0 variety | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Mariner | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Seas | .
|0 Friendliness | |1 of | |0 staff | |1 The | |0 Liberty | |1 and | |0 Mariner | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Seas | |1 both | |0 get | |0 high | |0 grades | .
We |1 did | |0 have | |1 one | |0 waiter | that |0 complained | |0 some | |1 on | |1 one | |1 of | our |0 trips | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Mariner | .
"We |0 had | |1 a | |0 slightly | |0 better | |0 experience | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Liberty | , |1 but | |0 feel | that |1 both | |0 crews | |0 did | |1 an | |0 excellent | |0 job | |1 and | that this |1 should | not |1 be | |1 a | |0 distinguishing | |0 factor | on |0 choosing | |1 a | |0 cruise | ."
|0 Pools | |1 The | |0 Mariner | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Seas | |1 and | |0 Liberty | |1 both | |0 had | |0 salt | |0 water | |0 pools | - which |0 most | |0 cruise | |0 ships | |0 have | .
They |1 both | |0 had | |0 pools | |1 for | |0 kids | |1 and | |0 adults | .
We |0 liked | |1 the | |0 Liberty | 's |0 pools | |0 better | because |1 one | |0 had | |1 a | |0 slide | .
"If you |0 have | |0 kids | , this |1 would | |1 be | something that they |1 would | |0 definitely | |0 enjoy | ."
|0 Spa | We |0 tried | |1 the | |0 spa | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Liberty | |1 and | |0 loved | it .
We |1 did | not |0 try | |1 the | |0 spa | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Mariner | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Seas | .
|0 Usually | you |1 ca | n't |0 go | |0 wrong | |0 when | |0 getting | |1 a | |0 spa | |0 treatment | ......

|0 How | |1 do | you |0 make | your |0 cat | |0 adjust | |1 to | |1 a | |0 new | |0 house | ?
Me |1 and | my |0 family | |1 are | |0 moving | |1 into | |1 a | |0 new | |0 house | |0 just | |1 outside | |1 a | |0 small | |0 town | .
We |1 are | |0 currently | |0 living | |1 a | |0 mile | |1 from | |1 the | |0 town | |1 in | |1 a | |0 house | |0 surrounded | |1 by | |0 fields | |1 but | |1 the | |0 new | |0 house | |1 is | |1 beside | |1 a | |0 busy | |0 road | .
We |1 have | |0 had | |1 the | |0 cat | |1 for | |1 10 | |0 years | |1 and | |1 do | nt |0 want | to |0 leave | it .
|0 How | |1 could | we |0 make | it |0 settle | |1 in | |1 a | |0 new | |0 house | .
you |1 are | not |0 just | |0 moving | |0 house | - your |0 cat | |1 is | |0 losing | his |0 territory | .
"|0 territory | |1 is | |0 very | |0 important | |1 to | |0 cats | , |1 and | they |1 are | |0 very | |0 nervous | |0 when | they |0 go | |1 into | |1 a | |0 new | |0 place | - |1 a | |0 new | |0 house | |1 could | |1 be | |0 full | |1 of | |0 predators | , |1 or | |0 unknown | |0 menaces | - |0 well | |0 at | |0 least | he |0 thinks | |0 so | ."
"you |1 will | |0 need | to |0 give | him |0 only | |1 a | |0 small | |0 place | to |0 explore | , so he |1 can | |0 make | it his |0 territory | , |1 and | |0 feel | |0 safe | |0 there | ."
"|0 then | , he |1 can | |0 have | |1 a | |0 place | to |0 retreat | |1 to | |0 when | he |0 feels | |0 scared | ."

"|1 the | |0 room | you |0 sleep | |1 in | |1 is | |0 best | ( |0 seeing | you |0 so | |0 relaxed | that you |1 are | |0 sleeping | |1 will | |0 send | |1 the | |0 message | that everything |1 is | |0 OK | ) , |1 but | |0 others | |1 will | |0 work | |0 just | |0 as | |0 well | ."

"he |1 will | |0 reassure | himself that |1 no | |0 other | |0 animal | |1 is | |1 in | |0 there | , |1 and | that |1 no | |0 other | |0 animal | |1 will | |0 come | |0 in | - he |1 is | |0 afraid | that he |1 is | |1 in | someone |0 else | 's |0 territory | |0 when | he |1 is | |1 in | |1 a | |0 new | |0 house | ."
"|1 in | |1 a | |0 week | 's |0 time | , he |1 will | |1 have | |0 made | it his , |1 and | |1 will | |1 be | |0 getting | |0 more | |0 bored | |1 than | |0 afraid | ."
"|0 let | him |1 out | |1 for | |1 half | |1 an | |0 hour | , to |0 explore | ."
|0 then | |0 put | him |0 back | |0 in | .
"he |1 will | |1 be | |0 freaked | |1 out | , |0 so | |0 going | |0 back | |1 to | his |0 territory | |1 will | |0 make | him |0 much | |0 happier | ."

"|0 soon | he |1 will | |0 make | |1 the | |0 whole | |0 house | his , |1 but | he |0 needs | |1 that | |1 one | |0 safe | |0 place | to |0 start | |1 from | ."
"|0 remember | to |0 visit | |1 with | him while he |1 is | |1 in | |1 the | |0 room | , |1 and | |0 tell | him |0 how | |0 good | he |0 is | ."
"|0 remember | to |0 give | him |1 the | |0 time | he |0 needs | to |0 feel | that |1 the | |0 room | |1 is | his - |0 rush | it , |1 and | he |1 will | |1 be | |0 afraid | |1 of | |1 the | |0 whole | |0 house | |1 for | |1 a | |0 long | |0 time | ."
he |1 might | |0 even | |0 start | |0 peeing | |1 on | |0 things | |1 in | |0 fear | .

"|0 Last | |0 night | , I |0 adopted | |1 a | |1 2 | |0 year | |0 old | |0 Male | |0 German | |0 Shepherd | ."
"( He |1 is | |1 92 | |0 pounds | ) He |1 does | not |0 listen | |1 to | |1 any | |0 commands | , |1 but | my |0 major | |0 problem | |0 is | that he |1 will | not |0 go | |0 outside | |1 on | |0 command | , |1 or | |0 even | |1 with | me ."
I |1 will | |0 walk | |0 outside | |1 and | he |1 will | |0 stand | |1 at | |1 the | |0 door | |1 and | |0 stare | |1 at | me |1 or | |0 run | |0 away | .
My |0 other | |0 MAJOR | |0 problem | |0 is | that he |1 will | not |0 get | |1 in | his |0 crate | .
"I |1 will | |0 get | |1 a | |0 treat | |1 and | |0 try | to |0 get | him |1 in | |0 there | |1 that | |0 way | , it |1 wo | nt |0 work | ."
He |1 wo | nt |0 even | |0 get | |0 close | |1 to | |1 the | |0 crate | .
"If I |0 come | |1 towards | him , he |1 will | |0 run | |0 away | ."
|0 How | |1 do | I |0 train | him to |0 feel | |0 comfortable | |1 in | his |0 crate | ?
|1 and | to |0 willingly | |0 go | |0 outside | ... |1 and | to |0 come | |1 on | |0 command | .
He |1 wo | nt |0 do | anything |1 on | |0 command | .
It |1 s | |0 very | |0 frustrating | .
I |0 have | |1 a | |1 9 | |0 month | |0 old | |0 German | |0 Shepherd | that I |0 raised | |1 from | |1 a | |0 puppy | .
I |0 trained | her myself .
"She |1 is | |0 crate | |0 trained | , |0 potty | |0 trained | , |1 and | |1 can | |0 sit | , |0 lay | |0 down | , |0 stay | , |0 come | , |0 fetch | , |1 and | |1 will | |0 even | |0 stay | |1 in | |1 a | |0 down | |0 position | while I |0 throw | |1 a | |0 treat | |1 across | |1 the | |0 floor | |1 or | |0 even | |0 right | |0 next | |1 to | her |0 paw | , |1 and | she |1 wo | nt |0 get | it until I |0 give | her |1 the | |0 command | ."
"|0 Yes | , |0 lots | |1 of | |0 time | |1 and | |0 lots | |1 of | |0 patients | ..."
I |0 just | |1 do | nt |0 know | |0 how | to |0 do | it |1 with | |1 a | |0 grown | |0 dog | .
She |0 tosses | me |1 around | like it |1 s | nothing !
"... |1 but | |0 basically | , what I |0 do | |1 is | |1 the | |0 same | |0 thing | I |0 did | |1 with | my |0 puppy | ... |0 lots | |1 of | |0 patience | , |0 lots | |1 of | |0 time | , |0 lots | |1 of | |0 praise | , |0 lots | |1 of | |0 treats | , |1 and | |0 lots | |1 of | |0 repition | .... |0 Right | ?"
|0 Is | there |1 any | |0 tricks | I |1 could | |0 use | ?
|0 Maybe | |0 get | |1 a | |0 book | |1 on | |0 training | .
You |0 have | to |1 be | |1 in | |0 command | |1 at | |1 all | |0 times | .
There |0 are | |0 ways | to |0 get | your |0 new | |0 dog | |0 used | |1 to | |1 the | |0 crate | |1 or | |0 going | |0 out | .
I |1 would | |0 start | |1 with | |1 a | |0 leash | .
|0 Put | |1 the | |0 leash | |1 on | |1 the | |0 dog | |1 and | |0 just | |0 walk | |1 around | |1 the | |0 crate | |1 a | |0 few | |0 times | .
|0 Then | |0 take | |1 the | |0 leash | |1 off | |1 and | |0 do | nothing |0 else | |1 but | that .
|0 Later | |0 do | it |0 again | .
"|0 When | |1 the | |0 dog | |1 is | |0 ok | |1 with | this , |0 then | |0 open | |1 the | |0 door | |1 and | |0 walk | |1 around | |1 the | |0 crate | , |0 leave | |1 the | |0 door | |0 open | |1 all | |1 the | |0 time | ."
|0 Put | something |0 fun | |0 inside | .
|0 Let | your |0 dog | |0 go | |0 in | |0 when | he |0 wants | to |1 for | |1 no | |0 reason | .
|1 Do | not |0 shut | |1 the | |0 door | .
|0 Let | him |0 walk | |0 in | |1 and | |0 out | |1 for | |1 a | |0 few | |0 days | .
|1 At | |1 some | |0 point | he |1 will | |0 feel | |0 ok | |1 with | this |1 and | you |1 can | |0 then | |0 close | |1 the | |0 door | |1 but | not |1 for | |0 long | |0 at | |0 all | .
|0 Open | |1 the | |0 door | |1 and | |0 let | him |1 out | |1 and | |0 see | |0 how | he |0 acts | .
"If you |0 push | it , it |1 will | |0 never | |0 work | ."
"With |0 going | |0 outside | , |0 put | |1 the | |0 leash | |1 on | |1 and | |0 just | |0 take | him |1 for | |1 a | |0 walk | ."
He |1 will | |0 learn | to |0 really | |0 like | this .
|0 Potty | |0 outside | |1 will | |0 come | |1 at | |1 some | |0 point | .
|0 Try | |0 obedience | |0 classes | .
"|0 Have | |0 patience | |1 with | him , you |0 just | |0 got | him |1 and | who |0 knows | |0 how | he |1 was | |0 treated | before you |0 brought | him |0 home | ."
|0 where | |1 can | I |0 find | |1 the | |0 best | |0 tours | |1 to | |1 the | |0 Mekong | |0 Delta | |1 at | |0 reasonable | |0 prices | ?
|1 will | |0 only | |1 be | |1 in | |0 Ho | |0 chi | |0 Minh | |1 for | |1 4 | |0 days | |1 and | I |1 am | |0 looking | |1 for | |1 a | |1 1 | |0 day | |1 or | |1 2 | |0 day | |0 trip | |1 to | |0 Mekong | |0 delta | .
I |1 have | |1 been | |0 researching | |0 on | |0 line | |1 and | |0 find | |0 things | |1 are | |0 quite | |0 pricey | |1 but | |1 the | |0 tours | |0 look | |0 great | .
|1 Should | I |0 just | |0 settle | |1 and | |0 book | |0 on | |0 line | ?
|1 or | |1 is | it |0 better | if I |0 wait | till I |0 get | |0 there | ?
"If I |0 wait | , |1 would | |1 the | |0 tours | I |0 find | |0 there | |1 for | |0 less | |0 money | |1 be | |1 the | |0 same | |0 quality | |0 type | |0 tours | ?"
"|0 Also | , |1 any | |0 tour | |0 recommendations | |1 would | |1 be | |0 very | |0 helpful | |0 a | |0 well | ."

|0 yoga | |1 and | |0 horses | ..... ?
I |0 got | |1 a | |0 riding | |0 lesson | |0 today | |1 on | |1 one | |1 of | my |0 boss | 's |0 fino | |0 horses | |1 and | it |0 made | me |0 realize | |0 just | |0 how | |0 unsteady | my |0 left | |0 leg | |0 is | .
I |0 mentioned | it |1 to | my |0 boss | |1 and | she |0 said | to |0 start | |0 doing | |0 yoga | .
|1 But | there |0 are | |0 just | |0 so | |0 many | |0 poses | |1 and | |0 programs | !
|1 Any | |0 good | |0 poses | |1 or | |0 programs | ( I |1 'm | |0 willing | to |0 buy | |1 a | |0 dvd | |0 as | |0 long | as it |1 is | |1 under | $ |1 20 | ) to |0 help | |0 specifically | |1 with | |0 leg | |0 stabilization | ?
I |0 just | |0 have | |1 a | |0 few | |0 issues | |0 supporting | my |0 back | |1 and | my |0 left | |0 leg | |0 flops | .
Because I |1 do | n't |0 feel | like |0 spending | |0 over | $ |1 20 | |1 on | |1 a | |0 freakin | |0 DVD |
I |0 also | |0 have | |0 back | |0 problems | that |0 transfer | |1 into | my |0 legs | .
"I |1 have | |0 done | |0 Yoga | |1 for | |0 riders | |1 for | |1 a | |0 while | , |1 a | |1 20 | |0 minute | |0 routine | I |0 found | |1 on | |0 YouTube | ( I |0 think | it |1 s | |0 called | "" |0 Yoga | |1 for | |0 horse | |0 back | |0 riding | "" |0 hosted | |1 by | |1 a | |0 man | ) It |0 helped | with |0 noticing | |0 slight | |0 differences | |1 in | my |0 balance | |1 and | |0 weight | |0 distribution | |1 but | |0 helped | not |0 really | |1 for | |1 the | |0 way | I |0 use | my |0 legs | |1 and | |0 back | ."
|0 Here | |1 is | what I |0 do | |0 now | |1 and | it |0 really | |0 helps | ....
|0 When | I |0 first | |0 get | |0 on | I |0 take | |1 1 | |0 leg | |1 and | |0 pull | it |0 back | |0 up | to |0 touch | my |0 butt | |1 with | my |0 heel | |1 and | |0 hold | it |0 there | |1 for | |1 1 | |0 lap | |1 at | |1 a | |0 walk | |1 around | |1 a | |0 large | |0 dressage | |0 arena | .
|0 Then | |1 the | |0 same | |0 thing | |1 with | |1 the | |0 other | |0 leg | .
"|0 Then | |1 1 | |0 lap | |1 at | |1 a | |0 walk | |1 around | |1 the | |0 arena | with |1 both | my |0 legs | |0 pulled | |1 out | |0 as | |0 far | as I |1 can | , so they |1 are | not |0 touching | |1 the | |0 saddle | ."
"|0 Then | |1 a | |0 lap | |0 doing | |0 scissors | , |1 one | |0 leg | |0 forward | |0 as | |0 far | as I |1 can | |1 and | |1 the | |0 other | |0 back | , |0 then | |0 switch | |0 legs | ."
"I |1 'll | |0 also | |0 trot | |0 doing | , |0 down | |1 2 | |0 beats | , |0 up | |1 one | |1 for | |1 a | |0 wile | , |0 then | |0 up | |1 2 | |0 down | |1 1 | |0 making | |0 sure | |1 the | |0 weight | |1 is | |0 going | |1 into | |1 the | |0 balls | |1 of | my |0 feet | ."
If |1 the | |0 weight | |1 is | |0 going | |1 into | your |0 heels | ( it |0 throws | your |0 leg | |0 forward | ) |0 put | |1 the | |0 stirrups | |0 up | |1 against | |1 the | |0 heel | |1 of | your |0 boot | .
"|0 Do | |1 a | |0 nice | |0 working | |0 trot | , |1 not | |1 a | |0 slow | |0 trot | ."

"|0 BTW | you |1 do | nt |0 want | your |0 leg | |0 locked | |1 in | |0 place | , it |1 will | |0 move | |1 WITH | |1 the | |0 horse | |1 a | |0 bit | ."
|0 When | I |0 first | |0 started | |0 doing | it I |1 'd | |0 do | it |1 every | |0 day | .
|0 Now | I |0 just | |0 do | it |0 once | |1 or | |0 twice | |1 a | |0 week | |1 or | as |0 needed | .
"|0 Now | |0 not | |0 only | |1 is | my |0 leg | |0 better | , |1 but | my |0 back | |1 is | |0 relaxing | ."

To |0 answer | your |0 questions | |1 in | |0 order | :
"1 ) It |1 is | not |0 normal | for |0 dogs | to |1 be | |0 vomiting | , |0 much | |0 less | to |0 have | |0 blood | |1 in | it ."
"|0 However | , if they |1 have | |1 been | |0 vomiting | |0 numerous | |0 times | , |0 then | |1 the | |0 blood | |1 could | |1 be | |1 due | |1 to | |0 irritation | |1 of | |1 the | |0 stomach | |1 and | |0 intestines | ."
"He |1 could | |0 also | |0 have | |0 Parvovirus | , |1 a | |0 GI | |0 foreign | |0 body | , |1 or | |1 any | |0 number | |1 of | |0 things | ."
|1 Did | your |0 vet | |0 take | |0 radiographs | ( |0 x | - |0 rays | ) ?
2 ) Your |0 vet | |1 would | not |0 prescribe | them if they |1 did | n't |0 think | it |1 would | |1 be | |0 helpful | .
"3 ) If he |0 shows | |1 no | |0 interest | |1 in | |0 water | , |0 then | |0 take | him |0 back | |1 to | your |0 vet | ."
It |1 could | |1 be | |1 due | |1 to | |0 nausea | |1 or | |1 any | |0 number | |1 of | |0 things | .
He |1 could | |0 become | |0 severly | |0 dehydrated | ( |0 especially | if he |0 continues | to |0 vomit | |1 and | |0 have | |0 diarrhea | ) .
"|1 From | |0 there | you |0 end | |1 up | |1 with | |0 electrolyte | |0 imbalances | , which |1 can | |0 lead | |1 to | |0 heart | |1 and | |0 kidney | |0 problems | ."
"|1 And | |1 being | |0 dehydrated | , |0 vomiting | , |1 and | |0 having | |0 diarrhea | |0 just | |1 does | n't |0 feel | |0 good | ."
4 ) |0 Call | your |0 vet | .
"They |1 should | |1 have | |0 discussed | |1 a | |0 bland | |0 diet | |1 with | you , |0 including | |1 the | |0 frequency | |1 of | |0 feeding | |1 and | |0 how | |0 much | to |0 feed | |1 at | |1 each | |0 sitting | ."
"It |0 sounds | like your |0 dog | |1 may | |0 benefit | from |1 being | |0 hospitalized | , |1 and | |0 put | |1 on | |0 IV | |0 fluids | to |0 help | his |0 hydration | , |0 administer | |1 the | |0 antibiotics | |0 IV | , |1 and | to |0 ensure | that he |0 starts | to |0 recover | ."
You |1 should | |0 ABSOLUTELY | |0 call | your |0 veterinarian | |1 back | |0 immediately | to |0 clarify | anything you |0 have | |0 questions | |1 about | .
"They |1 have | |0 seen | your |0 pet | , |1 and | |1 are | |0 most | |0 aware | |1 of | his |0 condition | ."
|1 No | |0 one | |0 online | |1 will | |1 be | |0 able | to |0 assist | you |0 more | than your |0 vet | |1 can | .
You |0 need | to |0 ask | your |0 vet | |1 these | |0 questions | .
|0 Boiled | |0 WHITE | |0 rice | |1 and | |0 boiled | |0 chicken | |0 breast | .
|0 Bland | |0 food | .
|1 NO | |0 SPICES | !
"My |0 vet | |0 told | me |0 when | |1 a | |0 dog | |1 is | |0 vomiting | |1 a | |0 lot | , it |1 could | |1 be | |1 a | |0 sign | |1 of | |0 obstruction | ."
|1 Did | they |0 do | |1 any | |0 x | - |0 rays | ?
I |1 do | n't |0 know | if |0 vomiting | |0 blood | |1 is | |0 common | |1 with | |1 this | |0 ailment | .
You |1 should | |0 call | your |0 vet | |0 now | |1 and | |0 ask | them what |1 is | |0 normal | |1 or | not .
|0 French | |0 dating | |0 etiquette | ?
I |1 would | |0 really | |0 love | to |0 hear | what |1 the | |0 French | |1 or | those who |1 had | |0 dated | |1 the | |0 French | |1 to | |0 say | something |1 about | this .
I |1 'm | |1 in | my |0 20's | |1 and | |0 currently | |0 studying | |1 in | |0 France | .
"|0 Coming | |1 from | |1 an | anglo - |0 saxon | |0 country | my |0 version | |1 of | |0 dating | |0 is | ' |0 getting | |1 the | |0 number | , |0 asking | her |1 out | , etc. . '"
"|0 However | , I |1 've | |0 read | |1 on | |1 the | |0 internet | that |1 the | |0 French | |0 dating | |0 etiquette | |1 is | |0 totally | |0 different | ."
"|1 For | them , |0 dating | |1 would | |0 normally | |0 be | |0 meeting | |1 in | |0 groups | |1 or | |0 parties | , |0 then | |0 pairing | |1 off | ."
"|1 In | |0 addition | , |1 from | my |0 understanding | |1 one | - |1 on | - |1 one | |0 dates | |1 is | something that |0 comes | |0 much | |0 later | |1 and | |0 not | ' |0 straight | - |0 away | ' |1 like | us anglo - |0 saxons | ."
They |1 are | |0 also | |0 very | |0 secretive | about |1 being | |1 in | |1 a | |0 relationship | .
They |0 only | ' |0 go | |0 out | |1 in | |1 the | |0 open | ' once they |1 have | |0 reached | |1 a | |0 certain | |0 level | |1 of | |0 seriousness | .
|1 Is | it |0 true | ?
"I |1 have | |0 told | |1 a | |0 French | |0 girl | I |0 liked | her , |1 and | she |0 accepted | ."
She |1 is | |0 friendly | |0 when | we |0 see | |1 each | |0 other | |1 on | |0 campus | .
She |1 is | |0 also | |0 nicer | |0 when | we |1 are | |0 both | |0 alone | .
"|0 However | , |0 when | we |1 are | |1 at | |0 parties | |1 or | |0 when | they |0 are | |0 people | |0 around | she |0 seems | to |0 ignore | me ."
"She |0 also | |0 seems | to |0 hate | it |0 whenever | I |0 ask | her |1 out | |1 on | |1 a | |0 date | , |1 to | |1 the | |0 point | she |0 said | |0 stop | !"
My |0 mind | |0 thinks | she |0 has | |1 no | |0 interest | |1 in | me |1 and | |0 just | |0 stringing | me |0 along | .
|1 But | |1 the | |0 articles | I |0 read | |0 seemed | to |0 say | |1 the | |0 contrary | .
|1 Have | I |0 just | |0 fallen | |0 victim | |1 in | |1 a | |0 cultural | |0 trap | ?
What you |1 have | |0 read | |1 in | |1 the | |0 internet | |1 is | |0 fairly | |0 accurate | |1 but | |0 of | |0 course | it |1 does | not |0 fit | |1 all | |0 scenarios | .
"You |1 are | not |0 French | |1 for | |1 a | |0 start | , |0 so | |1 the | "" |0 rules | "" |1 or | "" |0 customs | "" |1 may | not |0 apply | |1 to | you |0 when | it |0 comes | to |0 entering | |1 into | |1 a | |0 relationship | |1 between | |0 people | |1 from | |0 different | |0 backgrounds | ."
From what you |0 say | |1 the | |0 messages | |0 given | |1 by | |1 this | |0 girl | |1 are | |0 quite | |0 clear | .
She |1 is | not |0 stringing | you |0 along | since she |1 is | |0 actually | |0 discouraging | you |1 and | |1 is | |0 honest | |0 enough | to |0 tell | you to |0 stop | |0 asking | her |1 out | .
She |1 is | |0 just | |1 being | |0 friendly | |1 in | |0 public | because she |1 does | not |0 want | to |0 offend | you |1 and | she |0 treats | you |1 like | |1 any | |0 other | |0 friend | .
"You |0 said | you |0 liked | her |1 and | she |0 accepted | it |1 as | |1 a | |0 truth | |1 and | |0 perhaps | |1 as | |1 a | |0 compliment | , |1 but | it |1 does | not |0 mean | she |0 fancies | you |1 or | |0 wants | to |0 pair | |1 off | |1 with | you ."
"|1 At | |0 parties | she |1 does | not |0 want | to |1 be | |0 considered | |1 in | |1 any | |0 way | |0 attached | |1 to | you , which |1 is | |0 consistent | ."
"|0 Take | |1 the | |0 messages | for what they |1 are | : she |0 has | |1 no | |0 objection | in you |1 being | |0 pals | |1 at | |0 uni | , |1 but | she |1 does | not |0 want | to |0 take | |0 matters | |0 further | ."
""" Non ! "" |0 means | "" non "" , |1 not | "" I |1 might | |0 consider | it , |1 and | I |1 will | |0 keep | you |0 attached | |1 to | my |0 apron | |0 strings | |0 just | |1 in | |0 case | . """
|0 Christiane | |0 gave | you |1 a | |0 good | |0 answer | .
You |1 have | |0 fallen | |1 in | |1 a | |0 cultural | |0 misunderstanding | .
"What I |0 have | to |0 add | |0 is | that it |1 is | |0 normal | |1 in | |0 France | to |0 have | |0 mixed | |0 gender | |0 groups | |1 of | |0 friends | , there |0 's | nothing |0 unusual | in |0 boys | |1 and | |0 girls | |1 being | |0 only | |0 friends | , which |1 is | |0 obviously | what |1 this | |0 girl | |0 wants | |1 from | you ."
"She |0 probably | |0 finds | your |0 company | |0 pleasing | |1 as | |1 a | |0 friend | |1 but | you |1 are | not her |0 choice | |1 a | |1 a | |0 boyfriend | |1 and | she |1 is | |0 trying | to |0 keep | it |1 on | |1 a | |0 friendship | |0 level | , |1 and | |0 trying | to |0 make | you |0 understand | that she |1 does | n't |0 want | to |0 go | |0 further | ."
If she |1 is | |0 nicer | |0 when | you |1 are | |0 alone | I |1 'd | |0 say | it |0 is | because |1 in | |0 public | |0 view | she |1 is | |0 making | |0 sure | that |0 people | |1 do | not |0 think | that you |1 might | |1 be | her |0 boyfriend | .
You |1 do | |0 find | |1 the | ' |0 get | |1 the | |0 number | |0 hop | |1 in | |0 bed | |1 with | her ' |1 but | |1 be | |0 aware | that they |0 usually | |0 have | |1 a | |0 reputation | |1 as | |0 sluts | .
"|0 Unfair | |1 for | |1 the | |0 girl | as |0 boys | |1 do | n't |0 have | |1 that | |0 kind | |1 of | |0 handicap | , |1 but | that |1 's | |1 the | |0 way | our |0 own | |0 rules | |0 work | ."
|1 Should | |1 have | |0 done | |0 research | before you |0 left | .
|0 Why | not |0 just | |0 take | your |0 chances | |1 and | |0 do | it your |0 way | ?
|0 True | |1 or | |0 false | : |1 being | |1 a | |0 young | |0 New | |0 Zealander | |0 means | |0 having | |1 no | |0 future | ?

|0 why | |1 does | my |0 baby | |0 king | |0 snake | |0 refuse | to |0 eat | ?

i |1 have | |0 tried | EVERYTHING i |1 can | to |0 get | him to |0 eat | |1 but | he |0 refuses | .

( i |0 know | that |0 snakes | that |0 have | |0 problems | |0 going | |1 to | |1 the | |0 bathroom | |1 wo | n't |0 eat | . )
"he |1 has | |1 been | |0 drinking | |0 water | ( i |1 am | |0 pretty | |0 sure | he |1 has | |1 been | |0 drinking | it |1 out | |1 of | his |0 bowl | , |1 but | |0 also | i |1 have | |1 been | |0 feeding | him |0 water | |1 and | he |1 does | n't |0 ever | |0 give | me |1 a | |0 problem | |1 with | that - i |0 just | |0 stick | his |0 head | |1 near | |1 the | |0 water | |1 and | he |0 sucks | it |1 down | . )"
i |0 handle | him |1 every | |0 few | |0 days | .
"he |1 is | |0 feisty | , as |0 most | |0 king | |0 snakes | |0 are | , |1 but | he |1 is | |1 a | |0 very | |0 nice | |0 little | |0 guy | - he |0 never | |0 tries | to |0 bite | |1 or | anything ."
i |0 just | |0 love | him |1 to | |0 death | .
i |1 do | n't |0 know | |0 why | he |1 wo | n't |0 eat | |0 though | !
i |1 have | |0 tried | |0 feeding | him |1 5 | |1 or | |1 6 | |0 live | |0 pinkies | |1 and | |1 4 | |1 or | |1 5 | |0 frozen | ( |0 thawed | ) |0 pinkies | .
i |1 have | |0 never | |0 tried | |0 feeding | him |1 a | |0 pinky | that |1 was | |0 bigger | |0 around | than he |0 is | .
i |1 have | |0 tried | |0 putting | him |1 in | |1 a | |0 small | |0 container | |1 and | |0 putting | him |1 in | |1 a | |0 dark | |0 place | |1 for | |1 an | |0 hour | |1 or | |0 so | |1 and | he |1 wo | n't |0 touch | |1 the | |0 pinky | .
he |0 crawls | |1 on | |0 top | |1 of | them |1 but | |1 does | not |0 try | to |0 eat | them .
he |1 does | n't |0 seem | to |0 know | that they |1 are | |0 food | .

i |1 have | |0 bought | |1 some | |0 long | |0 reptile | |0 feeding | |0 tweezers | |1 and | |1 have | |0 tried | |0 holding | |1 the | |0 pinky | |1 in | |0 front | |1 of | |1 the | |0 snake | 's |0 face | .

i |1 am | |0 very | |0 discouraged | |1 and | |0 sad | |1 and | i |1 do | n't |0 know | what to |0 do | .
he |1 has | n't |0 eaten | |1 in | |1 an | |0 entire | |0 month | .
i |1 've | |0 only | |0 tried | to |0 feed | him |1 one | |1 at | |1 a | |0 time | .
"he |1 's | |0 just | |1 a | |0 tiny | |0 baby | , |1 about | |1 the | |0 width | |1 of | |1 a | |0 pencil | ."
|1 do | |0 babies | |0 this | |0 small | |0 hibernate | ?
|0 When | you |0 feed | him |0 how | |0 many | |0 pinkies | |1 do | you |0 feed | him ?
If you |0 feed | him |0 too | |0 many | he |1 could | |0 just | not |1 be | |0 hungry | .
If he |1 does | n't |0 seem | |0 interested | |1 in | them |0 at | |0 all | I |1 would | |0 say | he |1 's | |0 just | not |0 hungry | .
My |0 boyfriend | |0 has | |1 one | |1 and | |0 when | she |1 's | |0 hungry | she |0 attacks | |1 the | |0 pinkie | |0 right | |0 away | .
They |1 can | |0 smell | it |0 so | i |1 'm | |0 sure | he |0 knows | what it |1 is | |1 and | |0 just | |1 do | n't |0 want | it .
|0 Remember | |0 snakes | |1 can | |0 go | |1 a | |0 while | without |0 eating | .
"|1 In | |1 the | |0 winter | , they |1 will | |0 usually | |0 go | |0 deep | |0 underground | |1 and | |0 enter | |1 a | |0 hibernation | - |0 like | |0 state | |0 called | |0 brumation | , which |1 is | |0 characterized | |1 by | |1 a | |0 slowed | |0 metabolism | |1 and | |0 reduced | |0 activity | ."
"|0 King | |0 snakes | |0 sometimes | |0 stop | |0 eating | , |0 particularly | |1 during | |1 the | |0 cooler | |0 part | |1 of | |1 the | |0 year | ."
They |0 have | |1 a | |0 natural | |0 instinct | to |0 hibernate | .
"If |1 the | |0 snake | |1 is | not |0 pregnant | |1 or | |0 shedding | , |1 and | its |0 enclosure | |1 is | |0 properly | |0 equipped | , |1 a | |0 loss | |1 of | |0 appetite | |0 probably | |0 signals | |1 a | |0 beginning | |1 of | |0 hibernation | ."
"|0 Hibernation | |1 is | |0 natural | , |1 and | |1 a | |0 necessity | |1 for | |0 snakes | that |1 are | |0 going | to |1 be | |0 bred | ."
|1 Another | |0 thing | that |1 can | |0 cause | |1 a | |0 king | |0 snake | to |0 stop | |0 eating | |1 is | |0 shedding | .
"You |1 can | |0 tell | |0 when | your |0 king | |0 snake | |1 is | |0 about | to |0 shed | , because its |0 eyes | |1 will | |0 get | |0 milky | |0 looking | ."
"Its |0 body | |1 will | |1 be | |0 dull | |0 looking | , |0 too | ."
|1 In | |1 a | |0 few | |0 days | |1 the | |0 snake | |1 will | |0 begin | to |0 shed | its |0 skin | .
"|1 For | |0 example | , |1 some | |0 snakes | |1 will | |0 routinely | |0 go | |1 off | their |0 food | |1 in | |1 both | |1 the | |0 summer | |1 and | |0 winter | , |0 feeding | |0 mainly | |1 in | |0 spring | |1 and | |0 fall | ."
It |1 's | |0 natural | |1 and | |0 so | |0 long | as you |1 do | n't |0 see | |1 any | |0 serious | |0 deterioration | |1 in | their |0 health | |1 is | nothing to |0 worry | |1 about | .
"You |0 see | , |1 some | |0 snakes | |1 for | |1 no | |0 obvious | |0 reason | |1 will | |0 simply | |0 go | |1 off | their |0 food | ."
They |1 're | |0 fit | |1 and | |0 healthy | |1 and | their |0 care | |1 is | |0 suitable | .

"|0 give | them |0 time | to |0 set | |1 up | their |0 territories | , |1 and | once you |0 bring | |1 the | |0 new | |0 kitten | |1 out | , |0 pay | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | |0 attention | |1 to | |1 the | |0 male | ."
"you |1 have | |0 brought | someone |0 else | |1 into | his |0 territory | , |1 and | he |0 needs | to |1 be | |0 reminded | that you |0 still | |0 love | him , |1 and | |0 support | his |0 claim | |1 to | his |0 space | ."
"that |1 will | |0 help | to |0 reassure | him , |1 and | he |1 will | |1 be | |0 less | |0 aggressive | |1 with | her ."
"|0 when | they |0 play | |0 fight | , they |1 do | n't |0 hiss | ."
"if they |0 hiss | , they |1 are | not |0 playing | ."
"if they |0 bite | , |1 and | |1 one | |0 cries | , you |1 must | |0 separate | them , |1 and | you |1 must | |0 keep | |1 an | |0 eye | |1 on | them ."
"|0 hissing | |1 is | |0 OK | , unless they |0 start | to |0 fight | ."
"if that |0 happens | , |0 separate | them , |1 and | |0 give | them |0 time | |0 apart | ."
"|0 putting | |1 the | |0 girl | |1 in | her |0 territory | |1 will | |0 make | her |0 feel | |0 less | |0 afraid | , |1 and | she |1 will | |0 relax | ."
|0 good | |0 luck | !
"|1 A | |0 hiss | |1 is | |0 basically | |1 a | "" |0 get | |1 the | |0 f*ck | |0 away | "" |0 sound | ."
It |0 means | they |1 've | |0 gone | |0 too | |0 far | .
|0 When | they |0 start | |0 bleeding | that |0 means | they |1 're | |0 really | |0 fighting | .
"If they |1 're | |0 going | |0 kinda | |0 slow | |1 and | |0 like | |0 fake | |0 biting | ( not |0 biting | |0 as | |0 hard | as they |1 can | ) , |1 and | |0 fake | |0 scratching | ( not |0 hitting | |0 as | |0 hard | as they |1 can | |1 with | their |0 paws | ) |0 then | they |1 're | |0 playing | ."
"I |0 have | |1 two | |0 cats | , |1 and | |0 at | |0 first | they |0 hissed | |1 at | |1 each | |0 other | because |0 cats | |1 are | |0 very | |0 territorial | , |1 but | |0 now | they |1 do | |0 fight | |1 and | |0 play | ."
"|1 The | |0 difference | |0 is | |0 when | |1 the | |0 cat | |0 hisses | , that |0 means | they |1 are | |0 annoyed | |1 and | they |0 want | |1 the | |0 other | |0 cat | to |0 go | |0 away | ."
That |0 means | they |1 are | |0 fighting | .
|0 When | they |1 are | |0 just | |0 jumping | |1 at | |1 each | |0 other | |1 and | their |0 tails | |1 are | |0 wagging | that |0 means | that they |1 are | |0 playing | .
I |1 can | |0 see | |0 how | you |0 get | |0 confused | |0 though | . :)
What |1 was | |1 the | |0 goal | |1 for | |0 North | |0 Vietnam | |1 in | |1 the | |0 Tet | |0 offensive | ?
|0 When | |0 Johnson | |0 deployed | |0 troops | |1 in | |1 1964 | he |1 was | |0 advised | |1 by | |1 the | |0 military | it |1 would | |0 take | |1 a | |0 half | - |1 million | |0 troops | |0 about | |1 ten | |0 years | to |0 pacify | |0 South | |0 Vietnam | .
He |0 refused | to |0 believe | them |1 and | |0 ordered | |1 the | |0 military | to |0 win | |1 the | |0 war | |1 within | |1 two | |1 to | |1 three | |0 years | ( |1 before | |1 the | |0 next | |0 election | |1 in | |1 1968 | ) .
He |1 did | not |0 give | them |1 the | |0 number | |1 of | |0 troops | they |0 requested | .
"This |0 left | |0 Westmoreland | |1 with | |0 few | |0 options | , |0 so | he |0 adapted | |1 a | |0 Search | |1 and | |0 Destroy | |0 strategy | |0 instead | |1 of | |1 a | |0 Clear | |1 and | |0 Defend | |0 strategy | which |1 is | , |1 in | |1 the | |0 long | |0 run | , |1 the | |0 preferred | |0 method | of |0 pacifying | |1 an | |0 insurgency | ."
"|0 Thing | |0 is | , it |0 worked | ."
"|1 The | |0 ARVN | |1 was | not |0 having | |1 a | |0 big | |0 problem | |1 with | |1 the | |0 Local | |0 VC | ( |1 the | |0 guerilla | |0 movement | ) , they |1 were | |1 being | |0 challenged | |1 by | |1 the | |0 Main | |0 Force | |0 VC | ( which |1 was | |0 light | |0 infantry | ) |1 and | |1 the | |0 North | |0 Vietnamese | |0 Army | ( |0 NVA | ) ."
"|0 When | |1 the | |0 Americans | |0 swept | |0 in | |1 with | their |0 Search | |1 and | |0 Destroy | |0 operations | |1 the | |0 Communists | |0 quickly | |0 leaned | they |1 could | not |0 stand | |1 up | |1 to | |1 the | |0 US | |0 firepower | , |1 and | |1 these | |0 regular | |0 troops | |1 were | |0 forced | to |0 flee | |1 the | |0 country | |1 and | |0 take | |0 sanctuary | |1 across | |1 the | |0 borders | |1 in | |0 Laos | |1 and | |0 Cambodia | ."
"|1 All | |1 those | |0 sunny | |0 reports | |1 about | |1 the | |0 progress | |1 in | |0 Vietnam | |1 were | |0 correct | , |1 the | |0 Communists | |1 WERE | |1 being | |0 defeated | ."
"|0 However | , |0 Johnson | |1 would | not |0 let | |1 the | |0 military | |0 cross | |1 the | |0 borders | |1 and | |0 clean | |1 out | |1 the | |0 Communist | |0 bases | ."
"He |1 was | |0 warned | that they |1 were | |0 building | |1 up | |1 a | |0 huge | |0 Army | |1 and | |1 would | |0 eventually | |0 launch | |1 an | |0 attack | , |1 but | he |0 ignored | his |0 military | |0 advisers | ."
|1 The | |0 Communists | |0 agreed | .
They |1 could | not |0 defeat | |1 the | |0 Americans | .
"|0 However | , what they |0 hoped | to |0 do | |1 during | |1 the | |0 Tet | |0 Offensive | |0 was | to |0 sneak | |1 past | |1 the | |0 Americans | |1 and | |0 attack | |1 the | |0 ARVN | |1 in | |1 the | |0 urban | |0 areas | |0 where | they |1 were | |0 deployed | |0 doing | |0 successful | |0 Clear | |1 and | |0 Defend | |0 operations | ."
"|1 The | |0 Communists | |0 thought | they |1 could | |0 defeat | |1 the | |0 ARVN | , |0 cause | |1 the | |0 fall | |1 of | |1 the | |0 South | |0 Vietnamese | |0 government | , |1 and | |1 the | |0 people | |1 would | |0 than | |0 rally | |1 to | |1 the | |0 Communist | |0 cause | |1 and | |0 leave | |1 the | |0 Americans | |0 stranded | |1 in | |1 a | |0 sea | |1 of | |0 angry | |0 peasants | ."
THAT |1 WAS | |1 THE | |0 PLAN | .
What |0 happened | ?
|1 The | |0 Americans | |0 detected | |1 the | |0 attempt | to |0 infiltrate | |1 the | |0 urban | |0 areas | |1 and | |1 were | |0 already | |0 redeploying | |0 troops | |1 from | |1 the | |0 rural | |0 areas | .
|1 The | |0 ARVN | |0 rushed | |0 back | |1 from | |0 holiday | |0 leave | |1 and | |0 counterattacked | .
|1 Within | |1 24 | |0 hours | |1 every | |0 Communist | |0 assault | |1 had | |1 been | |0 defeated | |1 except | |1 in | |1 the | |0 ancient | |0 capital | |1 of | |0 Hue | .
|1 The | |0 government | |1 did | NOT |0 fall | .
|1 And | |1 the | |0 South | |0 Vietnamese | |0 people | ?
"|0 When | |0 give | |1 the | |0 ultimate | |0 choice | , they |0 rallied | …"
|1 TO | |1 THE | |0 SOUTH | |0 VIETNAMESE | |0 GOVERNMENT | ….
|0 Tet | |1 was | |1 a | |0 huge | |0 military | |1 and | |0 political | |0 disaster | |1 for | |1 the | |0 Communists | .
They |1 were | |0 chased | |0 back | |1 into | |0 Laos | |1 and | |0 Cambodia | with |1 the | |0 ARVN | |1 in | |0 hot | |0 pursuit | .
"|1 The | |0 people | |0 rejected | their |0 attempt | to |0 topple | |1 the | |0 government | , |1 and | |1 for | |1 all | |0 intents | |1 and | |0 purposes | |1 the | |0 US | |0 military | ( |1 and | |1 the | |0 ARVN | ) |0 handed | |0 Johnson | |1 the | |0 victory | he |1 had | |0 ordered | them to |0 achieve | |1 within | |1 the | |0 time | - |0 frame | he |0 ordered | it ."
|1 All | he |0 had | to |0 do | |1 for | |1 a | |0 complete | |0 victory | |0 was | |0 allow | |1 the | |0 military | to |0 go | |1 into | |0 Laos | |1 and | |0 Cambodia | |1 and | |0 finish | |1 off | |1 the | |0 shattered | |0 Communist | |0 forces | .
|1 But | |0 Johnson | |1 was | |0 so | |0 obtuse | he |1 did | n’t |0 understand | he |0 had | |1 a | |0 victory | |0 when | it |1 was | |0 handed | |1 to | him |1 on | |1 a | |0 silver | |0 platter | .
"|0 Instead | he |0 pulled | |1 the | |0 military | |1 off | , |0 stopped | |1 the | |0 bombing | |1 of | |0 North | |0 Vietnam | , |0 withdrew | |1 from | |1 the | |0 presidential | |0 race | , |1 and | |0 spent | |1 the | |0 rest | |1 of | his |0 term | |1 in | |0 office | |0 trying | to |0 surrender | |1 to | |0 North | |0 Vietnam | ."
They |0 screwed | |1 up | by |0 not | |0 accepting | his |0 surrender | |0 when | he |0 offered | it .
"|1 The | |0 American | |0 people | |1 were | NOT |0 having | |1 any | |1 of | it , |1 and | |0 elected | |0 Richard | |0 Nixon | to |0 fix | |1 the | |0 mess | |0 LBJ | |1 had | |0 made | ( not to |0 surrender | like |1 the | |0 antiwar | |0 movement | |1 was | |0 demanding | ) ."
|1 In | |1 the | |0 end | |0 Nixon | |0 kept | his |0 promise | |1 for | “ … |0 peace | |1 with | |0 honor | …. ”
|1 But | that |1 ’s | |1 another | |0 question | .
"To |0 emancipate | |1 the | |0 south | , |1 but | it |1 was | |1 a | |0 serious | |0 failure | ."
To |0 make | |1 the | |0 war | |0 unpalatable | |1 to | |1 the | |0 American | |0 public | .
"|1 In | that , they |0 pretty | |0 much | |0 succeeded | ."
"|1 Before | |0 Tet | , |1 the | |0 war | |1 was | |0 unpopular | |1 but | |0 tolerable | |1 to | |1 the | |0 majority | |1 of | |0 Americans | in that |1 the | |0 loss | |1 of | |0 American | |0 lives | |1 was | |0 seen | |1 as | |1 the | |0 cost | of |0 subduing | |1 the | |0 VC | |1 and | |0 NVA | ."
|0 Tet | |0 made | it |0 clear | that |1 the | |0 war | |1 was | |1 a | |0 long | |0 way | from |1 being | |0 over | if |1 the | |0 Americans | |0 thought | they |1 could | |0 preserve | |1 the | |0 South | |1 and | that |1 the | |0 North | |1 was | |0 perfectly | |0 willing | to |0 suffer | |0 great | |0 losses | to |0 continue | their |0 fight | .
There |0 is | |1 a | |0 very | |0 good | |0 book | |1 on | |1 the | |0 subject | that |1 was | |0 written | |1 by | |0 General | |0 Vo | |0 Nguyen | |0 Giap | .

|0 Bearded | |0 dragon | |0 question | ... ?
I |0 just | |0 bought | |1 a | |0 baby | |1 one | |0 yesterday | .
I |0 have | |1 a | |0 basking | |0 spot | |0 lamp | that |0 says | it |1 is | |1 a | |0 double | |0 reflector | that |0 focuses | |1 35 | % |0 more | |0 light | / |0 heat | |1 and | |0 provides | |0 beneficial | |0 UVA | |0 rays | |0 important | |1 to | |1 the | |0 psycholical | |0 well | - |0 being | |1 of | him .
"My |0 question | |0 is | |1 does | that |0 mean | it |0 gives | him |0 not | |0 only | |1 the | |0 heat | , |1 but | |1 the | "" |0 sun | |0 rays | "" he |0 needs | ?"
I |0 also | |1 was | |0 wondering | |0 how | |0 long | |1 should | |1 this | |0 light | |1 be | |0 on | .
"|1 The | |0 lady | |1 at | |0 pet | |0 smart | |0 said | |1 4 | |0 hours | , |1 but | |1 on | |0 places | |1 on | |1 the | |0 net | it |0 says | |1 10 | |1 to | |1 12 | |0 hours | ."
"He |1 's | |0 getting | |0 used | |1 to | his |0 new | |0 home | , |1 but | |1 has | n't |0 eatin | |0 yet | ."
I |0 have | |0 bearded | |0 dragon | |0 juvenile | |0 food | |1 and | |0 freeze | - |0 dried | |0 crickets | .
|1 Any | |0 advice | |1 would | |1 be | |0 greatly | |0 appreciated | .
|0 Thank | you |1 for | your |0 time | .
"|0 Let | me |0 try | to |0 break | this |1 down | |0 as | |0 simply | as I |1 can | : |0 diurnal | ( |0 active | |1 during | |1 the | |0 day | |0 time | ) |0 reptiles | |1 like | |1 the | |0 bearded | |0 dragon | |0 require | |1 3 | |0 types | |1 of | "" |0 light | , "" |0 UVA | , |0 UVB | , |1 and | |0 heat | ."
"|1 Any | |0 white | |0 light | |0 emitting | |0 light | |0 source | |1 will | |0 emit | |0 UVA | , |0 including | |0 heat | |0 bulbs | , that |1 's | |1 the | |0 easy | |0 one | to |0 provide | |1 for | ."
|0 UVB | |1 on | |1 the | |0 other | |0 hand | |1 can | |0 only | |1 be | |0 reproduced | |1 by | |1 a | |0 fluorescent | |0 source | .
"|0 UVB | |1 will | |0 always | |1 be | |1 a | |0 separate | |0 bulb | |1 from | |1 the | |0 heat | |0 lamp | , unless you |0 use | |1 a | |0 MVB | ( |0 mercury | |0 vapor | |0 bulb | ) which |1 is | |1 the | |0 only | |0 reptile | |0 use | |0 bulb | that |1 will | |0 emit | |1 both | |0 UVB | |1 and | |0 heat | |1 from | |1 one | |0 bulb | ."
I |0 highly | |0 recommend | that you |1 do | not |0 use | |0 coiled | / |0 compact | |0 UVB | |0 bulbs | as they |1 are | |0 known | to |0 cause | |0 severe | |0 eye | |0 damage | |1 and | / |1 or | |0 blindness | |1 in | |0 reptiles | |0 not | to |0 mention | they |0 have | |0 trouble | |0 maintaining | |0 UVB | |0 output | |1 over | |0 time | .
"|1 The | |0 long | |0 tube | |0 UVB | |0 bulbs | |1 are | |0 best | , |1 like | |0 Zoomed | 's |0 Repsitun | |0 model | : http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ |0 Remember | to |0 replace | |0 UVB | |0 bulbs | |0 according | |1 to | |1 the | |0 manufacturer | s |0 recommendation | |1 after | |1 which | |0 time | |1 the | |0 bulb | |1 will | |0 no | |0 longer | |0 produce | |0 UVB | |0 even | if |0 visible | |0 light | |0 still | |0 is | ."
"|0 So | , to |0 answer | your |0 question | , |0 no | , if you |0 just | |0 have | |1 a | |0 bulb | that |0 says | it |0 produces | |0 UVA | |0 then | you |1 do | not |0 have | "" |1 the | |0 sun | 's |0 rays | "" that your |0 bearded | |0 needs | ."
You |0 need | to |0 also | |0 provide | |1 a | |0 source | |1 a | |0 UVB | |0 lighting | .
|1 The | |0 person | |1 at | |0 Petsmart | |1 is | |0 very | |0 wrong | ; |1 in | |0 fact | it |1 is | |0 always | |1 a | |0 good | |0 idea | to |0 second | |0 guess | what |0 most | |0 pet | |0 store | |0 employees | |0 tell | you ; they |1 do | n't |0 have | |1 the | |0 best | |0 track | |0 record | |0 regarding | |0 giving | |0 reliable | |0 pet | |0 care | |0 info | .
"|0 UVB | |1 and | |0 basking | |0 temp | ( |1 should | |1 be | |0 about | |1 110 | |0 F | |1 for | |1 a | |0 baby | , |1 95 | |0 F | |1 for | |1 an | |0 adult | ) |1 should | |1 be | |0 available | |1 for | |1 10 | - |1 12 | |0 hours | |1 a | |0 day | ."
|0 Freeze | |0 dried | |0 food | |1 is | not |1 a | |0 good | |0 staple | |0 food | |0 source | ; you |0 need | to |0 offer | |0 live | |0 feeder | |0 insects | .
"|0 Bearded | |0 dragons | |1 are | |0 sight | |0 hunters | , they |0 need | to |0 see | |1 the | |0 food | |0 move | to |0 trigger | |1 a | |0 feeding | |0 response | , |0 especially | |0 when | they |1 are | |0 babies | ."
|0 Live | |0 food | |1 is | |0 also | |0 higher | |1 in | |0 nutritional | |0 value | |1 than | |0 freeze | |0 dried | .
"|0 Crickets | , |0 silk | |0 worms | , |0 phoenix | |0 worms | , |1 and | |0 various | |0 feeder | |0 roaches | , |1 like | |0 red | - |0 lobster | , |0 turkistan | , |1 and | |0 dubia | , |1 are | |0 good | |0 example | |1 of | |0 staple | |0 insects | to |0 offer | your |0 bearded | ."
"|0 Wax | |0 worms | |1 and | |0 meal | |0 worms | |1 should | |0 only | |1 be | |0 offered | |1 as | |0 treat | |0 items | , |1 for | |0 variety | 's |0 sake | ."
I |1 would | |0 highly | |0 recommend | that you |0 read | |1 through | |1 some | |0 reliable | |0 bearded | |0 guides | to |0 make | |0 sure | you |0 have | everything |0 set | |1 up | |0 correctly | :
http://herp-info.webs.com/beardeddragon.htm
http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/caresheet/?page=1
|0 mm | it |0 depends | |1 on | |1 the | |0 size | |1 of | his |0 tank | |1 or | |0 cage | |1 or | |1 whatever | you |0 have | him |1 in | .. |0 atleast | |0 as | |0 far | as i |1 'm | |0 concerned | .
"if there |0 are | |0 shady | |0 areas | he |1 can | |0 move | |1 to | ( |1 for | |0 example | |1 a | |1 3 | x |1 5 | x |1 4 | |0 tank | |1 with | |0 light | |1 on | |1 one | |0 side | ) |0 then | you |1 can | |0 leave | it |0 on | |1 a | |0 full | |1 12 | - |1 14 | |0 hours | , if it |1 s | |1 a | |0 small | |0 tank | |1 and | he |1 ca | n't |0 escape | |1 the | |0 light | |0 then | |1 4 | - |1 6 | |0 at | |0 most | |1 at | |1 a | |0 time | |0 though | |0 quite | |0 possibly | |1 4 | - |1 6 | |0 hours | |1 at | |1 a | |0 time | |0 twice | |1 a | |0 day | ."
|1 either | |0 way | you |0 also | |0 need | to |0 keep | |1 an | |0 eye | |1 on | |1 the | |0 temperature | if you |1 are | |0 using | |1 a | |0 dry | |0 fish | |0 tank | |1 as | |0 UV | |0 lights | |1 in | my |0 experience | |0 up | |1 the | |0 temperature | |0 significantly | |1 and | |1 without | |0 proper | |0 ventilation | it |1 can | |0 become | |1 an | |0 oven | .
|1 as | to what |1 the | |0 light | |0 provides | it |0 gives | |0 UV | |0 rays | .. which |1 is | |0 important | |1 for | |0 health | |1 in | |0 lizards | as it |1 is | |1 in | |0 humans | .
|1 That | |0 lady | |1 at | |0 PetSmart | |1 is | |1 a | |0 disgrace | |1 to | |1 the | |0 rest | |1 of | us |0 PetSmart | |0 associates | ... |0 sheesh | .
"|0 Yes | , it |0 gives | him |1 the | "" |0 sun | |0 rays | "" |0 necessary | , that |0 's | what |0 UVA | |1 is | ."
"|1 And | it |1 should | |1 be | |0 on | |1 10 | - |1 12 | |0 hours | , |0 just | like |1 the | |0 sun | |1 would | |1 be | |0 up | |1 for | |1 10 | - |1 12 | |0 hours | |1 in | his |0 natural | |0 environment | ."
"|1 As | |1 for | |1 the | |0 heat | , |0 just | |1 be | |0 sure | to |0 use | |1 a | |0 thermometer | ."
"|0 Also | , |0 Beardies | |0 often | |1 do | not |0 eat | |0 food | that |1 is | not |0 moving | , |0 so | it |0 s | anyone 's |0 guess | whether |1 or | |0 not | he |1 'll | |0 touch | |1 the | |0 freeze | - |0 dried | |0 crickets | |1 or | |1 the | |0 processed | |0 food | ."
"I |0 tell | |0 all | my |0 customers | they |1 can | |0 try | it , |1 but | |1 do | n't |0 count | |1 on | it ."
"|0 Also | |0 try | |0 green | |0 leafy | |0 veggies | , |1 like | |0 kale | |1 and | |0 spinach | ."

"|0 Hi | |0 there | ,"
|0 Please | |0 choose | |1 the | |0 parakeet | ...
|0 Here | |1 s | my |0 reason | .....
I |0 did | |1 the | |0 same | |0 thing | that you |0 did | |1 for | |0 christmas | .
I |0 ended | |1 up | |0 getting | |1 a | |0 pair | |1 of | |0 zebra | |0 finches | |1 for | |0 christmas | .
|1 At | |0 first | it |1 was | |0 all | |0 cool | |1 and | |1 all | .
They |1 were | |0 chirping | |1 and | |0 doing | their every |0 day | |0 business | .
|1 After | |1 a | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 weeks | I |0 got | |0 tired | |1 of | them .
They |1 are | |0 quite | |0 messy | |1 and | you |1 can | not |0 hold | |1 or | |0 pet | them .
I |1 ve | |0 tried | to |0 tame | them |1 and | they |0 just | |1 would | not |1 get | |0 tamed | .
They |1 do | nt |0 want | to |1 be | |0 held | |1 or | |0 touched | .
I |0 want | |1 a | |0 bird | that I |1 can | |0 hold | |1 and | |0 do | |0 tricks | .
I |0 still | |0 have | them |1 and | they |1 are | |0 doing | |0 well | .
|1 A | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 months | after I |0 got | |0 parakeets | / |0 budgies | .
They |1 are | |0 adorable | they |0 have | |0 beautiful | |0 colors | |1 and | |0 personality | .
I |0 love | them .
|0 First | |1 of | |1 all | they |1 are | |0 very | |0 tame | .
I |0 tamed | them |1 in | |1 4 | |0 days | .
They |1 can | |0 do | |0 tricks | |1 and | they |1 are | nt |0 messy | .
|1 The | |0 whole | |0 family | |0 loves | them .
My |0 parents | |0 even | |0 plays | |1 with | them .
They |1 are | |1 a | |0 big | |0 part | |1 of | our |0 family | .
I |0 hope | this |0 helps | you |1 with | your |0 decision | .

|0 When | |0 choosing | |1 a | |0 parakeet | |0 look | |1 for | |1 a | |0 young | |0 one | .
"( |1 the | |0 younger | |1 the | |0 eaiser | to |0 tame | ) |0 Look | |1 for | |0 clean | |0 smooth | |0 feathers | , |0 beak | , |1 and | |0 clean | |0 vent | |0 feathers | ( |1 the | |0 feathers | |1 around | |1 the | |0 butt | .. |0 dirty | |0 vent | |0 feathers | |0 means | |1 the | |0 bird | |1 is | not |0 healthy | ) |0 Look | |1 for | |1 a | |0 dark | |0 eye | |1 with | |1 no | |0 circles | ( |1 the | |0 older | |0 ones | |0 have | |1 a | |0 circle | |0 ring | |1 in | their |0 eyes | ) ."
|0 Look | |1 for | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | |0 stripes | |1 in | their |0 head | that |0 starts | |1 from | |1 the | |0 beak | |1 and | |0 goes | |0 back | |1 to | |1 the | |0 back | |1 fo | |1 the | |0 bird | .
|1 the | |0 stripes | |1 are | |1 like | |0 hair | |1 the | |0 less | |0 stipes | |1 the | |0 older | .
( |0 think | |1 of | |1 a | |0 balding | |0 man | |0 lol | ) |0 Look | |1 for | |0 clean | |0 feathers | .
If you |0 want | |1 a | |0 boy | |1 the | |0 cere | ( |1 the | |0 nostrils | |0 piece | |1 above | |1 the | |0 beak | ) |1 must | |1 be | |0 blue | .
|1 The | |0 girl | |0 has | |1 either | |0 pink | |1 or | |0 brown | .
I |1 would | |0 recommend | that you |0 get | |1 two | |0 parakeets | .
"|1 But | |0 get | |1 either | |1 one | |0 male | |1 and | |1 one | |0 female | , |1 or | |1 two | |0 males | ."
|1 Do | not |0 get | |1 two | |0 females | .
"They |0 sometimes | |1 do | nt |0 get | |0 along | ( you |0 know | |0 how | |1 some | |0 girls | |1 are | |0 lol | |0 hahahaahh | |1 but | |1 for | |0 real | |0 though | , |1 two | |0 girls | |0 tend | to |0 fight | |1 a | |0 lot | ."
I |0 have | |1 one | |0 yellow | |0 girl | |1 and | |1 a | |0 green | |1 and | |0 yellow | |0 boy | .
They |1 are | |1 the | |0 best | !
If you |0 choose | to |0 get | |1 a | |0 parakeet | this |1 is | |1 a | |0 trick | that I |0 used | to |0 tame | them .
"|0 However | if you |0 plan | on |0 getting | |1 one | , |0 then | |0 get | |0 more | |1 than | |1 one | |1 at | |1 the | |0 same | |0 time | they |0 need | |0 company | ."
My |0 mom | |0 told | me |0 how | to |0 tame | them |1 and | I |1 was | |0 very | |0 happy | |1 with | |1 the | |0 results | .
It |0 took | me |1 4 | |0 days | to |0 get | |1 the | |0 new | |0 one | to |1 be | |0 able | to |0 step | |1 on | |1 and | |0 eat | |1 out | |1 of | my |0 hand | .
These |1 are | |1 the | |0 steps | I |0 used | .
|0 Honestly | they |1 have | |0 worked | |1 for | me |0 twice | |1 with | my |0 parakeets | .
|0 Hopefully | they |1 will | |0 work | |1 for | you .
"1 ) |0 When | you |0 get | |1 the | |0 bird | , |0 place | him |1 or | her |1 or | them |1 in | |1 the | |0 cage | ."
|0 Leave | them |1 in | |0 there | |1 with | |0 food | |1 and | |0 water | |1 and | |0 such | |1 for | |0 about | |1 2 | |0 hours | .
2 ) |0 Then | |0 place | you |0 hand | |1 in | |1 the | |0 cage | .
I |0 took | |1 the | |0 cage | |1 and | |0 place | it |0 next | |1 to | |1 the | |0 couch | .
"|0 Then | I |0 sat | |1 on | |1 the | |0 couch | , |0 placed | |1 one | |0 hand | |1 in | |1 the | |0 cage | , |0 holding | |1 a | |0 millet | |0 spray | ."
"( |1 this | |0 way | the |1 will | |0 associate | your |0 hand | |1 with | |0 food | , |1 and | |0 birds | |0 love | |0 food | |0 lol | ) |0 Then | I |0 turned | |1 on | |1 the | |0 tv | |1 and | |0 watch | ."
|1 This | |0 way | they |1 will | |0 see | that your |0 hand | |1 is | |0 good | |1 and | it |1 s | not |0 going | to |0 grab | them |1 or | |0 hurt | them .
|0 Do | this |1 for | |0 about | |1 one | |0 hour | .
( you |1 can | |0 take | |0 breaks | if you |0 have | too ) |1 and | |0 repeat | |1 the | |0 steps | |1 after | |0 about | |1 2 | |0 hours | .
"3 ) |1 After | |0 about | |0 day | |1 2 | , they |1 will | |0 start | |1 to | |0 eating | |1 the | |0 millet | |0 spray | |1 from | your |0 hand | ."
"( |1 do | not |0 take | |1 away | |1 the | |0 food | |0 dish | |1 from | |1 the | |0 birds | , they |1 will | |0 associate | you |1 as | |1 the | |0 person | who |0 takes | |1 away | their |0 food | ) ...."
"|0 Then | |0 take | your |0 finger | |1 and | |0 place | it |1 under | their |0 belly | , |1 in | |0 front | |1 of | their |0 feet | |1 and | |0 say | |0 up | ."
|0 Push | you |0 finger | |1 to | their |0 feet | |0 gently | |1 and | |0 say | |0 up | .
( |1 the | |0 first | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 times | they |1 will | |0 fly | |0 all | |1 over | |1 the | |0 cage | |1 but | |0 as | |0 long | as you |1 do | nt |0 jump | |0 back | |1 or | |0 screem | they |1 will | |0 get | |0 used | |1 to | you ) They |1 will | |0 have | |1 no | |0 choice | but to |0 go | |1 on | your |0 finger | .
"|0 When | they |0 see | that you |1 ar | nt |0 harming | them , the |1 will | |0 go | |1 up | |1 on | your |0 finger | |0 when | you |0 say | |0 up | ."
4 ) If they |1 are | not |0 going | |0 up | |1 by | |0 now | you |0 just | |0 got | ta |0 keep | |0 trying | |1 and | |0 keep | |0 trying | .
"|1 Do | not |0 hit | , |0 yell | , |1 or | |0 harm | them ."
You |0 have | |0 patience | .
|1 Do | nt |0 give | |1 up | !
"|1 After | |1 a | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 weeks | mines |0 knows | |0 when | I |0 say | |0 shoulder | it |0 means | ot |0 go | |1 on | my |0 sholder | , |0 when | I |0 say | |0 up | it |0 means | to |0 jump | |0 up | |1 on | my |0 finger | , |0 when | I |0 say | |0 up | |1 and | |0 out | it |0 means | |1 up | |1 on | my |0 finger | |1 and | |1 out | |1 of | |1 the | |0 cage | ."
|1 and | |0 when | I |0 say | |0 go | |0 home | it |0 means | to |0 go | |1 in | |1 the | |0 cage | .
|0 Good | |0 luck | !
They |0 worked | |1 for | me |1 and | I |0 hope | they |0 worked | |1 for | you !
They |1 are | |0 awesome | !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
|1 And | that |1 s | my |0 reason | |0 why | you |1 should | |0 choose | |1 a | |0 parakeet | |1 over | |1 a | |0 finch | .
|1 a | |0 parakeet | |1 is | |0 friendlier |
|0 Parakeet | .
They |1 are | |0 normally | |0 quiet | |1 and | it |1 is | |0 easy | to |0 take | |0 care | |1 of | them .
They |1 are | |0 also | |0 friendly | .
I |0 have | |1 a | |0 parakeet | |0 named | |0 Cookie | . :P
|0 When | |1 is | |1 the | |0 best | |0 time | to |0 travel | |1 to | |0 Ireland | ?
My |0 sister | |1 and | I |1 would | |0 like | to |0 go | |1 to | |0 Ireland | .
"I |0 graduate | |1 in | |1 the | |0 spring | , |1 and | |0 so | we |1 'd | |0 like | to |0 go | |1 between | |0 then | |1 and | |0 winter | ."

We |1 're | |0 both | |1 in | our |0 early | |0 20s | |1 and | |0 just | |0 wanting | to |0 explore | |1 the | |0 beautiful | |0 country | while we |1 're | |0 still | |0 young | |1 and | before our |0 lives | |0 start | to |0 get | |0 even | |0 crazier | !
|1 Can | anyone |0 give | me |1 an | |0 idea | of |0 when | |1 the | |0 best | |0 time | for us to |0 go | |1 to | |0 Ireland | |1 would | |1 be | ?
"|0 People | |1 do | not |0 go | |1 to | |0 Ireland | |1 on | |0 holiday | |1 for | |1 the | |0 weather | , it |1 is | |0 unpredictable | ."
|1 One | |0 thing | you |1 can | |1 be | |0 sure | |1 of | |1 about | |0 Irish | |0 weather | |0 is | |0 how | |0 little | you |1 can | |1 be | |0 sure | |1 of | .
"It |1 may | |1 be | |0 shirtsleeves | |1 and | |0 sunglasses | |1 in | |0 February | , |1 but | |0 winter | |0 woollies | |1 in | |0 March | |1 and | |0 even | |1 during | |1 the | |0 summer | ."
|1 And | |0 then | |0 there | |0 ’s | |1 the | |0 rain | .
"|0 Ireland | |0 receives | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | |0 rain | , with |0 certain | |0 areas | |0 getting | |1 a | |0 soaking | |0 as | |0 many | |1 as | |1 270 | |0 days | |1 of | |1 the | |0 year | ."

It |1 does | |0 get | |0 pretty | |0 cold | |1 in | |0 Ireland | |0 so | |0 going | |1 before | |0 winter | |1 is | your |0 best | |0 bet | .

|0 Rent | |1 a | |0 car | |1 and | |0 spend | |1 a | |0 couple | |0 days | |0 outside | |1 of | |0 Dublin | |0 seeing | |1 the | |0 countryside | |1 and | you |1 will | |0 have | |1 the | |0 trip | |1 of | |1 a | |0 lifetime | .

|1 By | |0 definition | |0 most | |0 tourists | |1 will | |0 go | |1 to | |1 the | |0 best | |0 places | |0 so | you |1 might | |0 have | to |0 put | |1 up | |1 with | |1 a | |0 few | |0 tourists | |1 along | |1 the | |0 way | .

|1 The | |0 water | |0 changes | |0 help | |1 with | that |0 too | .
You |0 also | |1 may | |0 need | to |0 treat | |1 the | |0 incubation | |0 water | .
|1 The | |0 chlorine | |1 and | |0 ammonia | ( |0 choramine | ) |1 are | not |0 good | |1 for | |1 the | |0 eggs | .

|0 Leaving | |1 a | |0 jar | |1 with | |1 a | |0 dozen | |0 black | |0 worms | |1 in | it |1 will | |0 sate | |1 the | |0 adult | 's |0 desire | |1 for | |0 snacks | |1 and | they |1 are | |0 more | |0 likely | to |0 leave | |0 fry | |1 or | |0 eggs | |0 alone | .
If |1 a | |0 pair | |1 is | n't |0 leaving | |0 eggs | ... |0 check | |1 the | |0 following | :
1 . |1 Is | |1 a | |0 tank | |0 mate | ( |0 such | |1 as | |1 another | |0 female | |0 killie | |1 or | |1 a | |0 Cory | |1 or | |0 large | |0 snails | ) |0 rating | |1 the | |0 eggs | ?

3 . |0 Is | there |0 too | |0 much | |0 mineral | |1 in | |1 the | |0 water | ?
|0 Aplo. | |0 lineatus | |0 are | |0 wide | - |0 spread | |1 over | |0 southern | |0 India | .
That |0 indicates | that they |0 thrive | |1 in | |0 different | |0 water | |0 chemistries | .
"|0 Still | if you |1 can | |0 get | your |0 pet | |0 shop | to |0 do | |1 a | |0 hardness | |1 or | |0 TDS | ( |0 total | |0 Dissolved | |0 Solids | ) |0 test | , that |1 may | |0 give | you |1 a | |0 hint | ."
"|0 Winging | it |1 a | |0 little | |0 here | , |1 a | |0 hardness | |1 of | |1 100 | |1 to | |0 nearly | |1 200 | |0 PPM | ( |0 parts | |1 per | |0 million | ) |1 or | |1 5.8 | |1 to | |1 10.6 | |0 DH | |1 should | |1 be | |0 fine | |1 for | |0 gardneri | ."
|0 TDS | |0 meters | ( |1 the | |0 thrifty | |0 aquarist | 's |0 hardness | |0 meter | |1 can | |1 be | |0 used | if one |1 has | |0 seen | |1 one | |1 of | your |0 municipal | |0 water | |0 department | 's |0 annual | |0 reports | .

|1 A | |0 number | |1 of | |0 minerals | |1 are | not |1 of | |0 much | |0 consequence | .
|0 However | if there |0 is | |1 a | |0 high | |0 level | |1 of | |0 sodium | |0 chloride | ( |0 common | |0 salt | ) that |1 can | |0 break | |1 down | |1 the | |0 chorion | ( |0 shell | ) |1 around | |1 the | |0 egg | |1 and | |0 allow | |0 critters | to |0 get | |0 in | |1 and | |0 eat | |1 the | |0 yoke | |1 and | |0 embryo | . )
|0 Ironically | |0 sometimes | it |1 is | |0 wise | |1 to | |0 newly | |0 picked | |0 eggs | |1 in | |0 fresh | |0 tap | |0 water | |1 with | |1 some | |0 chlorination | to |0 kill | |0 microscopic | |0 critters | that |0 ride | |0 in | |1 with | |1 the | |0 eggs | .

"If you |0 get | |0 eggs | |1 in | |1 the | |0 mail | |1 in | |1 a | |0 medicine | |0 vial | , that |1 is | |0 fine | ."
"|1 But | |0 get | |1 the | |0 eggs | |1 out | , |0 maybe | |0 rinsed | |1 in | |0 fresh | |0 tap | |0 water | |1 and | |0 then | |1 into | |1 the | |0 incubation | |0 water | ."
|1 In | |0 time | |1 the | |0 eggs | |1 can | |0 suffocate | |1 in | |1 the | |0 shipping | |0 container | .
"After |1 a | |0 number | |1 of | |0 people | |0 began | |0 complaining | |1 about | "" |0 mystery | |0 deaths | "" |1 among | |0 incubating | |0 eggs | , |1 some | |1 of | |1 the | |0 more | |0 advanced | |0 killie | |0 people | |0 began | |0 suggesting | that |1 after | |1 7 | - |1 8 | |0 days | |1 of | |0 incubation | , one |1 should | |0 do | |1 a | |1 100 | % |0 water | |0 change | - as |1 the | |0 eggs | |0 develop | , they |1 do | |0 release | |0 waste | |0 material | ."
|1 Another | |0 problem | |0 is | that |0 sometimes | |0 bad | |0 eggs | |1 will | |0 fungus | |1 and | |1 the | |0 fungus | |1 will | |0 spread | |0 out | |1 and | |0 kill | |1 all | |1 the | |0 eggs | .
"|1 Some | |0 people | |0 put | |1 in | |1 a | |0 very | |0 dilute | |0 Acriflaven | |0 solution | to |0 slow | |1 down | |1 the | |0 fungus | , so one |1 can | |0 take | |0 white | |0 eggs | |1 out | |1 with | |1 a | |0 pipette | |1 or | |0 eyedropper | ."
|0 Other | |1 will | |0 add | |1 a | |0 drop | |1 of | |0 Methylene | |0 blue | .

|0 Also | one |1 can | |0 keep | their |0 privacy | |1 in | |1 the | |0 cabins | |1 and | |0 make | |1 the | |0 time | |1 in | |0 seclusion | .
To |0 relax | |1 and | to |0 rejuvenate | |0 Disney | |0 cruise | |1 are | |1 the | |0 best | |0 option | .
There |0 are | |0 many | |0 online | |0 sites | |0 offering | |1 the | |0 booking | |0 facility | |1 with | |0 affordable | |0 rates | .
You |1 can | |0 select | |1 the | |0 proper | |0 route | |1 and | |0 travel | |0 plans | by |0 consulting | |1 the | |0 agents | |0 prior | |1 to | |1 the | |0 booking | ........
"|0 Off | |0 season | |1 is | |0 good | , |0 however | , |1 the | |0 Disney | |0 cruises | |0 are | |0 almost | |0 ALWAYS | |0 completely | |0 booked | ."
"I |1 would | |0 suggest | |1 a | |0 warmer | |0 season | , |1 but | |0 not | |0 Spring | |0 Break | |1 or | |0 early | |0 summer | ."
You |1 may | |0 also | |0 want | to |0 avoid | |0 Thanksgiving | |0 week | |1 and | |1 the | |0 Christmas | |0 holidays | .
"We |0 REALLY | |0 enjoyed | our |0 balcony | -- |0 coffee | |1 in | |1 the | |0 mornings | , |0 drinks | |1 at | |0 night | , |0 standing | |0 outside | |0 when | |0 docking | |1 and | |0 leaving | |0 port | -- |0 however | , it |1 is | |1 quite | |1 a | |0 bit | |0 more | |0 expensive | ."
"|1 With | |0 young | |0 ones | , I |1 would | |0 definitely | |0 get | |1 a | |0 window | |1 or | |0 view | |0 room | so they |1 can | |0 see | |0 outside | ."
|0 Check | |1 out | |1 the | |0 kids | ' |0 space | |0 as | |0 soon | as you |0 get | |0 onboard | .
|1 Do | NOT |0 feel | |0 guilty | about |0 taking | them |0 there | .
"They |0 have | |1 a | |0 BLAST | |0 so | |1 the | |0 sooner | they |0 get | |0 there | , |1 the | |0 sooner | they |1 can | |0 have | |0 fun | ."
"We |0 liked | |0 getting | |1 the | |0 late | |0 dinner | |0 seating | , so you |0 have | |0 more | |0 time | to |0 see | |0 movies | |1 and | |0 stuff | |1 but | if your |0 kids | |1 are | ' |0 early | |1 to | |0 bed | ' you |1 may | |0 want | |1 the | |0 earlier | |0 seating | |1 for | |0 dinners | ."
|0 Bring | |1 some | |0 sort | |1 of | |0 magnet | |1 or | |0 small | |0 magnetic | |0 whiteboard | |1 for | your |0 door | .
|1 All | |1 of | |1 the | |0 doors | |0 tend | to |0 look | |0 alike | |1 and | |0 having | ' something ' |1 on | your |0 door | |0 helps | you |1 and | your |0 kids | |0 find | your |0 room | |0 easier | .
You |1 can | |0 also | |0 leave | |0 notes | |1 for | |1 the | |0 rest | |1 of | your |0 family | ( |0 husband | ) about |0 where | you |1 are | |1 at | |1 any | |0 given | |0 point | .
|0 Cell | |0 phones | |1 do | NOT |0 work | |1 on | |0 board | |1 but | they |0 give | you |1 a | ' |0 walkie | - |0 talkie | ' |0 kind | |1 of | |0 phone | |1 in | your |0 room | that |1 WILL | |0 work | |0 onboard | .
|1 Each | |0 evening | you |1 will | |0 get | |1 a | ' |0 magazine | ' |0 called | |1 The | |0 Navigator | which |0 lists | |1 all | |1 of | |1 the | |0 activities | |1 for | |1 the | |0 next | |0 day | .
We |0 always | |0 took | ours |1 to | |0 dinner | |1 and | |0 discussed | |1 what | |0 things | we |0 felt | we ' |0 had | ' to |0 do | |1 and | |1 which | |0 ones | we |0 felt | like |0 skipping | |1 in | |0 lieu | of |0 just | |0 chilling | .
|1 Any | |0 time | |1 would | |1 be | |0 great | .
|0 off | |0 season | |0 cruises | |1 might | |0 actually | |1 be | |0 better | |1 with | |0 preschoolers | as |0 prices | |1 might | |1 be | |0 lower | |1 in | |1 the | |0 off | |0 season | .
"My |0 wife | |1 and | I , |1 in | our |0 60's | |1 at | |1 the | |0 time | , |0 originally | |0 planned | |1 a | |1 3 | |0 generation | |0 trip | |1 but | |1 some | |0 family | |0 emergencies | |0 caused | everyone |0 else | to |0 cancel | ."
We |0 had | |1 a | |0 ball | .
We |0 had | |1 an | |0 inside | |0 cabin | |1 and | it |1 is | what I |1 would | |0 recommend | .
There |0 are | |0 so | |0 many | |0 things | to |0 do | that you |1 will | |0 only | |0 use | your |0 room | |1 for | |0 sleeping | |1 and | |1 the | |0 extra | |0 cost | |1 of | |1 the | |0 balcony | |1 is | |0 wasted | .
|1 The | |0 children | |1 can | |1 be | |0 checked | |1 in | |1 and | |0 checked | |1 out | |1 in | |1 a | |0 safe | |0 way | |1 at | |0 many | |0 activities | |0 so | you |1 can | |0 have | |1 a | |0 bit | |1 of | |0 free | |0 time | |1 without | |1 the | |0 little | |0 ones | .
|1 The | |0 range | |1 of | |0 activities | |1 can | |1 be | |0 illustrated | by |0 describing | |1 the | |0 water | |0 activities | .
There |0 is | |1 a | |0 splash | |0 fountain | ( |1 no | |0 standing | |0 water | ) |1 for | |0 little | |0 ones | |0 still | |1 in | |0 diapers | ; |0 Next | |1 is | |1 a | |0 wading | |0 pool | |1 for | those who |0 are | |0 potty | |0 trained | ; |0 Then | |1 a | |0 family | |0 pool | ; |0 Finally | there |0 is | |1 a | |0 pool | |1 for | |0 adults | |0 only | with |0 kids | |0 not | |0 allowed | .
You |1 will | |0 never | |1 be | |0 so | |0 spoiled | |1 in | your |0 life | as you |1 are | |1 on | |1 a | |0 Disney | |0 Cruise | .
"If you |0 stay | |1 with | your |0 dining | |0 schedule | , |1 every | |0 night | |1 is | |0 dinner | |1 and | |1 a | |0 show | ."
|1 The | |0 real | |0 payoff | |1 is | that you |1 will | |0 have | |1 the | |0 same | |0 waiter | |1 for | |1 the | |0 entire | |0 cruise | .
Our |0 waiter | |0 quickly | |0 grasped | |1 the | |0 fact | that I |0 like | |0 Ginger | |0 ale | |1 and | |0 rather | |0 spicy | |0 foods | while my |0 wife | 's |0 taste | |0 ran | |1 to | |0 lemonade | |1 and | |0 less | |0 spicy | |0 fare | .
"Since they |0 knew | our |0 preferences | , we |0 almost | |0 always | |0 went | |0 along | |1 with | their |0 menu | |0 suggestions | |1 and | |1 were | |0 never | |0 sorry | we |0 did | ."
|0 Obviously | they |0 had | |1 a | |0 full | |0 beverage | |0 list | |0 including | |0 alcohol | |1 for | |0 adults | who |0 wanted | it .
"If you |1 should | |0 miss | |1 a | |0 meal | , you |0 also | |0 missed | |1 a | |0 great | |0 show | ."
|1 but | |0 food | |1 is | |0 always | |0 available | |1 and | it |1 is | |0 consistently | |0 good | .
I |0 think | I |0 gained | |1 three | |0 pounds | |1 in | my |0 week | |0 long | |0 cruise | .
"This |1 is | |1 about | my |0 farrier | , |0 girls | ."
That |0 's | |0 why | I |1 'm | |0 posting | |0 here | !
|0 Help | ?
"I |0 posted | this |1 in | |0 singles | |1 and | |0 dating | |0 too | , |0 so | I |1 've | |0 just | |0 copied | |1 and | |0 pasted | ."
"|0 Well | , I |1 'll | |0 try | to |0 make | this |0 short | ."

He |1 is | my |0 farrier | ( |0 shoes | my |0 horse | s |0 feet | ) |0 so | I |1 am | |0 technically | |1 a | |0 client | if you |0 want | to |0 view | it |1 that | |0 way | .
"|0 Well | , |0 almost | |1 two | |0 weeks | |0 ago | he |0 came | |0 out | |1 and | |0 did | my |0 horse | s |0 feet | |1 and | |1 was | |0 SO | |0 flirty | ."

That |1 has | |0 NEVER | |0 happened | |0 before | |0 so | I |1 was | |0 kinda | |0 realizing | |1 at | |1 that | |0 point | that he |1 was | |1 a | |0 little | |0 interested | .
|0 Right | ??
"|0 Anyway | , |0 so | he |0 ended | |1 up | |0 leaving | |1 one | |0 nail | |1 out | |1 of | my |0 horse | s |0 foot | ( I |1 've | |0 never | |0 heard | of |1 a | |0 farrier | |0 doing | this ) |1 and | |0 telling | me to |0 call | him |1 in | |1 a | |0 few | |0 days | ( |0 first | it |1 was | |1 a | |0 week | , |0 then | it |1 was | |1 a | |0 few | |0 days | |0 lol | ) |1 and | he |1 'd | |0 come | |0 back | |0 out | |1 and | |0 put | it |0 in | ."
He |0 told | me to |0 remember | to |0 call | |0 like | |1 3 | |0 times | before he |0 left | .
"|0 So | , I |0 waited | |1 a | |0 week | to |0 call | because I |1 was | |0 busy | |1 and | I |0 wanted | to |0 have | him |0 come | |0 out | |1 on | |1 a | |0 day | |0 when | I |1 am | |0 more | |0 available | |1 in | |0 case | we |0 were | to |0 hang | |1 out | |0 after | ;)"
"|0 Anyway | , |0 so | that |1 was | |1 2 | |0 days | |0 ago | |0 that | I |0 called | |1 and | |0 left | |1 a | |0 message | , |1 but | he |0 still | |1 has | n't |0 called | |1 back | |0 yet | ."
I |1 do | n't |0 know | if I |1 should | |0 call | him |0 again | |0 tomorrow | |1 or | not ?
"I |0 know | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | |0 people | |0 say | to |0 wait | until he |0 calls | you , |1 but | it |1 's | |0 different | because I |1 'm | |1 a | |0 client | |1 and | |0 technically | that |1 's | |1 all | I |1 am | |1 at | |1 this | |0 point | ."
"|1 On | |1 the | |0 other | |0 hand | |0 though | , if I |1 'm | |1 a | |0 client | he |1 should | |0 really | |1 of | |0 called | |1 back | |1 by | |0 now | because you |1 do | n't |0 leave | |1 a | |0 customer | |0 hanging | ."
He |1 did | n't |0 have | my |0 number | |0 either | because this |1 was | |1 the | |0 first | |0 time | I |1 've | |0 called | HIM |0 instead | |1 of | his |0 dad | .
It |1 's | |1 a | |0 father | |1 and | |0 son | |0 business | .
"|0 Anyway | , I |1 would | |0 appreciate | |1 ANY | |0 insight | |1 on | this |0 at | |0 all | ."
|0 Thank | you |1 for | |0 reading | if you |0 did | ! :)
"|0 Ok | , |0 well | |0 as | |0 far | as him |1 being | |1 a | |0 bad | |0 farrier | for |0 leaving | |1 a | |0 nail | |0 out | - That |1 is | not |1 the | |0 case | , they |1 are | |0 extremely | |0 well | |0 known | |0 farriers | |1 in | |1 the | |0 area | ."
I |1 would | |1 be | |1 a | |0 lot | |0 more | |0 concerned | if |1 the | |0 shoe | |0 fell | |0 off | because it |1 was | |0 missing | |1 one | |0 lousy | |0 nail | .
"|1 The | |0 reason | he |0 said | he |1 did | n't |0 put | |1 that | |0 nail | |0 in | |0 was | because he "" |1 did | n't |0 want | to |0 risk | it "" |1 with | my |0 horse | 's |0 horrible | |0 feet | ."
This |1 is | |0 about | |1 the | |0 fourth | |0 time | they |1 've | |0 done | my |0 horse | 's |0 feet | because I |0 just | |0 switched | |0 back | |1 to | them .
|1 The | |0 only | |0 reason | I |0 switched | |0 away | |1 from | them |1 in | |1 the | |0 first | |0 place | |0 is | because my |0 good | |0 friend | who |0 apprenticed | |1 with | them |1 was | |0 starting | |1 out | |1 on | his |0 own | .
"|0 However | , he |0 left | my |0 horse | |1 without | |1 a | |0 shoe | |1 for | |1 TWO | |0 WEEKS | ( |0 now | that |0 's | what I |0 call | |1 a | |0 crap | |0 farrier | ) ."
"Which , I |1 might | |0 add | |1 is | |1 the | |0 same | |0 foot | that |0 keeps | |0 crumbling | |1 with | |1 the | |0 nails | ."
"|0 So | , |0 obviously | I |0 switched | |0 back | |1 to | |1 these | |0 guys | ."
"|0 Ok | , |0 calm | |1 down | , it |0 's | not like he |1 's | |1 some | |0 stranger | that |0 came | |0 up | |1 and | |0 groped | me |0 lol | ."
I |1 've | |0 known | |1 the | |0 guy | |1 for | |0 about | |1 10 | |0 years | .
"I |1 am | |1 21 | , |0 so | |0 yeah | we |1 were | |0 both | |0 kids | |0 when | we |0 knew | |1 each | |0 other | !"
He |1 is | |1 a | |0 few | |0 years | |0 older | |1 than | me .
"|1 And | |0 yes | , I |1 do | |0 like | him ."
"To |0 answer | |0 Barry | |0 White | , |0 yes | that |1 did | |0 occur | |1 to | me :) I |0 hope | that |1 is | |1 all | he |1 's | |0 waiting | |1 for | ."
"|1 On | |1 the | |0 other | |0 hand | , he |1 could | |0 very | |0 easily | |0 just | |0 call | me |1 and | |0 say | |0 hey | I |1 'm | |0 busy | |0 right | |0 now | , I |1 'll | |0 call | you |0 when | I |1 can | |0 come | |0 out | ."
"|1 And | |0 as | |0 far | as |0 scheduled | |0 visits | |0 go | , I |0 have | |1 no | |0 idea | ."
I |1 've | |0 never | |0 done | that |0 before | |0 though | |0 either | .
"It |0 's | |0 always | |0 just | "" |0 Okay | , they're |0 feet | |0 need | to |1 be | |0 done | , |0 better | |0 call | |1 the | |0 farrier | . """
|1 And | they |0 usually | |0 come | |0 out | |1 within | |1 a | |0 few | |0 days | .
He |1 will | |0 call | you |1 back | I |1 m | |0 sure | !
|0 Sounds | like He |0 really | |0 likes | you ..
|1 But | you |0 need | to |0 ask | yourself |1 do | you |0 feel | |1 the | |0 same | |0 way | ?
|1 would | You |0 like | |0 going | |1 for | * |0 coffee | * |1 with | him ?
|1 or | |1 is | he Not your |0 type | ?
|1 Or | |1 are | you |0 undecided | ?
If i |1 were | you I |1 would | |0 Go | ...
I |1 would | |0 say | if he |1 does | not |0 call | you |1 back | |1 by | |0 friday | |0 call | him |0 again | he |1 could | |1 be | |0 playing | |0 hard | to |0 get | ?
I |0 think | he |0 left | |1 the | |0 Nail | |1 out | |1 of | |1 the | |0 shoe | |1 as | |1 a | |0 excuse | to |0 come | |0 back | |1 and | |0 see | you |0 hey | he |1 may | |1 be | your |0 Prince | |0 charming | ..
|0 Edit | ... I |0 really | |1 do | nt |0 think | Your |0 horse | |1 Is | |1 in | |0 danger | Of |1 being | |0 hurt | With |1 one | |0 Nail | |0 missing | ..
I |1 have | |0 seen | |0 horses | |0 Loose | |0 Nails | |1 On | there |0 Own | |1 And | |0 do | |0 just | |0 fine | with |1 ONE | |0 nail | |0 gone | |0 Now | if he |1 had | |0 left | |0 out | |1 2 | |1 or | |1 3 | I |1 would | |1 be | |0 wondering | |0 to | ...
I |0 really | |1 do | |0 belive | he |0 left | |1 the | |0 nail | |0 out | |1 becuse | |1 of | |1 the | |0 horse | s |0 Hoof | |0 condition | |1 and | It |1 s | |1 a | |0 added | |0 bonus | he |1 would | |0 get | to |0 see | her |0 again |
|0 When | I |1 was | |0 Younger | |1 In | my |0 early | |0 20s | My |0 farrier | |1 was | |1 A | |0 hottie | |0 named | |0 Joby | .. ( |1 for | those who |1 do | n't |0 Know | I |1 AM | |1 A | |0 GIRL | |0 read | my |0 Bio | |1 on | my |0 Page | ) |0 dumb | |1 as | |1 a | |0 post | |1 about | everything |1 But | |0 horses | ..
He |1 was | |1 In | his |0 30s | |0 divorced | |1 and | |0 Had | |1 2 | |0 kids | .. |1 but | we |1 both | |0 flirted | |0 Horribly | |1 with | |1 each | |0 other | .. |1 but | |1 neither | |1 one | |1 of | us |0 took | |1 the | |0 chance | |1 and | |0 Asked | |1 to | |0 other | |1 on | |1 a | |0 date | . :(
|0 sort | |0 a | |0 wonder | what it |1 would | |1 have | |1 been | |1 like | ?
|1 But | That |1 was | |0 Years | |0 ago | .
He |0 had | |1 this | |0 Habit | of |0 telling | you Everything ..
|0 Well | |1 one | |0 day | he |0 said | |1 to | me You |0 know | i |1 do | n't |0 wear | |0 Underwear | as he |1 was | |0 bent | |0 over | |0 Working | |1 on | my |0 Mare | s |0 Right | |0 front | |0 hoof | .. |1 and | I |0 was | |0 Like | |0 Ummmm | |0 okay | ???
I |1 m | |0 glad | his |0 butt | |1 was | |0 facing | me so he |1 could | n't |0 see | my |0 red | |0 face | I |0 think | my |0 Mare | |1 was | |0 even | |0 laughing | ..
|0 Well | |1 6 | |0 weeks | |0 Later | |0 when | he |0 came | |0 back | |0 out | He |1 was | |0 again | |0 working | |1 on | my |0 mare | s |0 front | |0 Foot | |1 and | I |0 looked | |0 Down | |1 and | |0 Yeah | he |0 had | |0 Wholes | |1 In | his |0 pants | |1 In | |1 the | |0 wrong | |0 places | I |0 bust | |1 out | |0 Laughing | |1 and | He |1 was | |0 like | what ???
I |0 was | |1 like | |0 Ummmm | i |1 can | |0 see | your |0 ass | |0 cheeks | ... he |0 was | |1 like | |0 Oops | |1 did | i |0 forget | my |0 Underwear | ???
that |1 was | |1 a | |0 strange | |0 way | to |0 flirt | .. |1 but | i |0 guss | it |1 was | his |0 way | ...
|1 But | like i |0 said | nothing |0 ever | |0 came | |1 of | It .. |1 the | |0 next | |0 time | I |0 saw | him He |1 had | |0 told | Me he |0 had | To |1 get | |0 married | |1 to | |1 a | |0 girl | Who he |0 worked | |1 with | becuse he |0 knocked | Her |1 Up | ..
I |1 was | |0 heartbroken | .. |1 but | |0 then | |0 realized | He |1 was | not |1 the | |0 Guy | |1 for | me ..
"|0 Wow | he |1 does | |0 sound | |0 interested | |1 in | you , my |0 farrier | |0 never | |0 gives | me |0 hugs | |1 like | that ( |0 probably | |1 a | |0 good | |0 thing | as he |0 has | |1 a | |0 wife | |1 and | |1 2 | |0 kids | ) |0 anyway | , I |0 find | that they |1 can | |1 be | |0 very | |0 busy | |0 so | I |1 would | |0 wait | |1 a | |0 week | |0 lo9nger | |1 and | if |0 still | |1 no | |0 reply | |0 give | him |1 a | |0 call | |1 but | |1 do | n’t |0 leave | |1 a | |0 message | so you |1 do | n’t |0 have | to |0 necessarily | |0 wait | for him to |0 call | ."
"|1 From | |1 the | |0 point | |1 of | |0 view | |1 of | |1 a | |0 business | , |1 and | |0 client | / |0 operator | |0 relationships | , he |1 's | |0 doing | |1 a | |0 really | |0 shitty | |0 job | ."
|0 Leaving | |0 nails | |0 out | so you |1 'll | |0 call | |1 and | |0 have | him |0 come | |0 back | |0 out | |0 later | ?
"|0 Cute | |1 or | not , I |1 'd | |0 call | |1 a | |0 different | |0 bloke | because he |1 's | |0 doing | |1 a | |0 sub-par | |0 job | |1 at | something he |0 needs | to |1 be | |0 doing | his |0 best | |1 at | , whether he |1 's | |0 flirting | |1 or | |0 trying | to |0 ask | you |0 out | |1 or | not , he |1 ought | to |0 put | |0 quality | |0 first | ."
"This |1 is | , |0 after | |0 all | , his |0 business | , |1 and | if he |0 wants | you to |0 remain | |1 a | |0 customer | |0 why | |1 on | |0 earth | |1 is | he |0 doing | |0 shoddy | |0 work | ?"
"|0 EPM | , Anyone |0 Dealt | |1 with | it ?"
|1 Might | |1 be | something |0 different | ?
I |0 have | |1 the | |0 opportunity | to |0 pick | |1 up | |1 a | |0 super | |0 nice | |1 6 | |0 year | |0 old | |1 for | |0 free | .
"He |1 's | not |0 lame | , |1 but | he |1 's | |1 been | |0 having | |0 issues | ."
|0 Here | |1 's | what |1 the | |0 owner | |1 has | |0 said | :
I |0 have | |1 a | |1 5 | |0 year | |0 old | that |0 lost | |1 all | |1 of | his |0 cheek | |0 muscle | |1 on | |1 the | |0 right | |0 side | |1 about | |1 3 | - |1 4 | |0 months | |0 ago | .
"I |0 chalked | it |1 up | |1 to | |0 possible | |0 nerve | |0 damage | , because this |1 is | what |1 the | |0 vet | |0 thought | |1 and | |1 the | |0 other | |0 cheek | |0 muscle | |1 was | |0 fine | |1 and | he |0 had | |1 no | |0 theeth | |0 problems | ."
|0 So | I |0 sent | him |1 to | |1 the | |0 trainers | |1 the | |0 first | |1 of | |0 September | to |1 be | |0 started | |1 on | |1 the | |0 barrels | .
I |0 got | him |0 back | |1 the | |0 first | |1 of | |1 the | |0 month | |1 and | he |1 had | |0 lost | |1 some | |0 weight | |1 but | |0 attributed | that to |1 be | |0 worked | |0 everyday | ( I |0 expected | him to |0 drop | |1 some | ) .
He |1 is | |0 now | |0 losing | |1 the | |0 cheek | |0 muscle | |1 on | |1 the | |0 left | |0 side | |1 of | his |0 face | |1 and | |0 seems | to |1 be | |0 dropping | |0 weight | |1 by | |1 the | |0 day | .
|0 Had | him |1 to | |1 a | |0 dentist | |0 yesterday | |1 and | there |0 is | |1 no | |0 teeth | |0 problems | .
"He |1 can | |0 eat | |1 all | his |0 feed | |1 and | |1 does | n't |0 drop | |1 any | , |1 but | |1 can | not |0 eat | |0 hay | |1 from | |0 lack | |1 of | |0 muscle | to |0 chew | it ."
He |1 is | |0 gant | |0 looking | |1 in | his |0 flank | |0 area | |1 and | |1 is | |0 losing | |0 topline | |0 muscle | .
|1 The | |0 only | |0 neurological | |0 sign | |1 that | he |0 shows | |0 is | that he |0 barely | |0 drags | his |0 toes | |1 and | |0 sometimes | |0 has | |0 trouble | |1 with | his |0 right | |0 lead | .
|1 The | |0 horse | I |1 had | |0 posted | |1 about | |1 a | |0 couple | |0 weeks | |0 ago | |1 with | |1 the | |0 atrophied | |0 cheek | |0 muscles | |1 is | |1 down | |1 to | his |0 last | |0 resort | |1 for | |0 life | .
I |1 CAN | NOT |0 afford | to |0 treat | whatever |1 is | |0 wrong | |1 with | him .
"|0 NO | , I |1 have | not |0 done | |1 an | |0 EPM | |0 test | |1 but | |1 have | |0 done | |1 an | |0 extensive | |0 blood | |0 panel | |1 and | my |0 vet | |0 did | |1 a | |0 neurological | |0 physical | |0 exam | ."
We |0 elected | to not |0 do | |1 the | |0 EPM | |0 test | because there |0 was | |1 NO | |0 neurological | |0 signs | .
"He |1 is | |0 still | |0 showing | |1 no | |0 signs | |0 other | |1 than | |1 the | |0 weight | |0 loss | , |1 and | |1 some | |0 muscle | |0 atrophy | ."
He |0 eats | |1 all | |1 of | his |0 grain | |1 but | it |0 just | |0 takes | him |1 a | |0 while | to |0 get | it |0 chewed | |1 because | |1 of | |1 the | |0 lack | |1 of | |0 muscle | |1 in | his |0 jaws | .
|0 So | I |1 might | |0 get | |1 the | |0 horse | |1 and | |0 see | what I |1 can | |0 do | .
"I |1 will | |1 be | |0 getting | |1 with | my |0 vet | |0 first | |1 and | if I |1 do | |0 get | him , |0 have | |1 the | |0 spinal | |0 fluid | |0 test | |0 done | |1 for | |0 EPM | |1 and | |1 a | |0 titer | |0 test | ."
|1 Will | |1 be | |0 getting | |1 a | |0 copy | |1 of | |1 the | |0 blood | |0 results | |1 the | |0 owner | |1 has | |0 already | |0 ran | |0 as | |0 well | .
My |0 other | |0 theory | |1 would | |1 be | |0 wobblers | .
I |1 'll | |1 be | |0 having | my |0 equine | |0 chiro | / |0 acupuncturist | |0 out | to |0 do | |1 some | |0 work | |0 as | |0 well | if I |1 do | |0 get | him ....
|0 So | |1 any | |0 ideas | ?
|0 Think | I |1 should | |0 do | it ?
"|0 Arby | ,"
|0 Horse | |1 is | |1 out | |1 of | |0 state | |1 and | not |0 local | .
|0 Owner | |1 is | |0 willing | to |0 meet | me half |0 way | |1 with | him .
I |1 will | |1 be | |0 calling | my |0 vet | |1 and | |0 chiro | |1 about | him .
"|0 Worse | |0 comes | |1 to | |0 worse | , I |1 'm | |1 out | |1 of | |1 the | $ $ |1 and | |0 have | to |0 put | him |1 down | |0 anyway | |1 or | |0 have | |1 a | |0 pretty | |0 pasture | |0 ornament | ."
He |1 's | |0 still | |0 rideable | |0 currently | |1 and | not |0 having | |0 many | |0 issues | |1 under | |0 saddle | .
This |1 is | |1 a | |0 horse | that I |0 otherwise | |1 would | n't |1 be | |0 able | to |0 afford | |1 and | |0 even | if I |0 spend | |1 2 | |1 K | |1 and | |0 treatment | I |0 come | |0 out | |1 ahead | |1 of | his |0 purchase | |0 price | .
"I |0 posted | what |1 the | |0 owner | |1 as | |0 said | |1 in | |0 paragraph | |1 2 | |1 & | |1 3 | , that |1 is | not me to |0 clarify | ."
She |1 is | |1 the | |0 one | that |1 ca | n't |0 afford | to |0 do | anything |0 else | |1 for | him in |0 case | he |1 does | n't |0 recover | |0 fully | .
He |1 can | |0 eat | |0 grain | |1 and | I |0 already | |0 have | |1 a | |0 feed | |0 regimen | |1 in | my |0 head | |1 for | |1 the | |0 guy | since he |1 ca | n't |0 eat | |0 regular | |0 hay | .
I |1 do | n't |0 think | it |1 will | |1 be | |0 hard | to |0 keep | his |0 weight | |0 up | |0 so | |0 long | as he |1 can | |0 eat | |1 the | |0 grain | .
I |1 am | not |0 going | to |0 go | |0 pick | |1 up | |1 a | |0 horse | I |1 ca | n't |0 afford | .
I |1 am | |0 willing | to |0 pull | |1 the | |0 EPM | |0 test | |1 and | |0 treat | .
|1 The | |0 owner | |1 is | |1 the | |0 one | who |1 is | |0 unable | .
I |1 will | |0 also | |1 be | |0 having | my |0 other | |0 vet | |0 up | who |1 's | |1 a | |0 chiro | |1 & | |0 acupuncturist | to |0 evaluate | him |1 for | |0 wobblers | .
|0 July | |1 is | |0 when | he |0 started | to |0 exhibit | |0 slight | |0 symptoms | |1 and | |1 the | |0 owner | |1 and | |0 vet | |0 originally | |0 thought | it |1 was | |0 just | |1 some | |0 nerve | |0 damage | |1 from | something |1 in | |1 the | |0 pasture | |1 with | |1 no | |0 visible | |0 injury | .
"He |1 's | |0 only | |0 exhibited | |0 weight | |0 loss | |1 and | |1 some | |0 muscle | |0 atrophy | , |1 with | |1 the | |0 slight | |0 toe | |0 drag | |1 and | |1 a | |0 bit | |1 of | |0 trouble | |1 with | |1 the | |0 right | |0 lead | ( which |1 could | |1 or | |1 could | n't |1 be | |0 related | ) ."
|1 The | |0 horse | |1 is | not |1 in | |0 pain | .
He |1 's | not |0 starving | .
He |1 's | |0 dropping | |0 we |
|1 The | |0 horse | |1 is | not |1 in | |0 pain | .
He |1 's | not |0 starving | .
"He |1 's | |0 dropping | |0 weight | , |1 but | |0 most | |1 of | that |0 came | from |1 being | |1 at | |1 the | |0 trainer | s |1 and | |1 being | |0 ridden | |0 hard | |1 for | |1 60 | |0 days | ."
He |1 's | not |0 putting | it |0 back | |0 on | .
I |0 know | that I |0 have | |1 the | |0 possibility | of |0 treating | him |1 and | |0 still | |0 having | to |0 put | him |1 down | .
|1 At | |1 the | |0 same | |0 time | I |1 do | |0 know | |0 people | who |1 have | |0 had | |0 horses | |0 come | |0 back | |0 successfully | |1 after | |0 EPM | .
I |0 know | this |1 is | |0 going | to |1 be | |0 expensive | .
I |1 'm | |0 willing | to |0 give | it |1 a | |0 shot | .
"|0 Gallop | , I |1 've | |0 already | |0 read | |1 that | |0 whole | |0 site | |1 and | |1 been | |0 reading | |1 through | |0 research | |0 articles | |1 from | |1 the | |0 research | |0 colleges | |0 as | |0 well | ."
"|0 Looked | |1 at | |0 studies | , |0 treatment | |0 options | |1 and | |0 such | ."
I |1 will | |0 have | |1 the | |0 EPM | |0 test | |0 done | before |0 treating | .
|1 The | |0 chiro | / |0 acupuncturist | |1 will | |1 be | |0 there | to |0 evaluate | |1 the | |0 horse | |1 for | |0 wobblers | which |1 is | |0 often | |0 caused | |1 by | |0 spinal | |0 compression | |1 and | |1 can | |1 be | |0 confused | |1 with | |0 EPM | .
If that |1 is | |1 the | |0 case | |0 then | |0 acupuncture | |1 is | n't |0 going | to |0 hurt | him .
It |1 's | |0 actually | |1 one | |1 of | |1 the | |0 alternative | |0 therapies | |1 for | |0 EPM |
I |0 think | it |1 is | |0 wonderfully | |0 responsible | that you |1 are | |0 going | |1 into | |1 this | |0 rescue | |0 eyes | |0 open | |1 and | |1 are | |0 getting | |1 the | |0 opinions | |1 of | |0 qualified | |0 professionals | ( |1 and | |1 a | |0 bunch | |1 of | |0 Yahoos | ) before you |0 decide | to |0 take | |1 this | |0 horse | |1 on | .
I |1 do | |0 think | |1 some | |0 Y!A | |0 users | |0 need | to |0 work | |1 on | their |0 reading | |0 comprehension | as I |1 ca | n't |0 comprehend | |0 how | |0 taking | |1 a | |0 horse | |1 in | |1 as | |1 a | |0 rescue | |1 and | |0 getting | it |0 qualified | |0 medical | |0 treatment | |1 is | |0 abuse | .
|0 Worst | |0 case | |0 scenario | you |0 fall | |1 in | |0 love | |1 and | after |0 spending | |0 thousands | |1 of | |0 dollars | you |0 have | to |0 put | |1 the | |0 horse | |1 down | .
|1 Is | that something you |1 are | |1 up | |1 for | ?
If |0 so | |0 go | |1 for | it |1 and | I |1 'll | |0 give | you |1 all | |1 the | |0 moral | |0 support | I |1 can | as you |0 figure | |1 out | what |1 is | |0 up | .
"It |1 is | |0 heartbreaking | to |0 try | to |0 bring | |1 a | |0 horse | |1 back | |1 and | |0 then | |0 have | to |0 put | it |1 down | , |1 but | |1 some | |0 horses | |1 are | |0 worth | |1 the | |0 risk | ."
If you |0 feel | |1 this | |0 guy | |1 is | |0 worth | it |0 then | I |0 hope | your |0 vet | |1 can | |0 figure | |0 things | |1 out | .
|1 As | |1 to | |0 EPM | like |0 Shee | |0 said | |1 being | |1 in | |0 MI | we |1 've | |0 had | to |0 deal | |1 with | it .
|0 Pretty | |0 much | |1 every | |0 large | |0 stable | |1 has | |0 here | .
Our |0 first | |0 diagnosed | |0 EPM | |0 horse | |0 was | |0 back | |0 when | there |0 was | |1 no | |0 treatment | |1 in | |1 the | |0 US | |1 and | |0 only | |1 an | |0 experimental | |0 chicken | |0 feed | |0 additive | |1 in | |0 Canada | .
We |0 hauled | |1 the | |0 horse | |1 to | |0 Windsor | |1 and | |0 got | him |0 treated | |0 there | .
|1 That | |0 horse | |0 returned | |1 to | |0 racing | |1 and | we |1 did | n't |0 notice | |0 much | |0 difference | .
"We |1 've | |0 had | |1 a | |0 few | |1 since | |0 then | , |1 but | |0 none | since our |0 race | |0 horses | |0 began | |0 wintering | |1 in | |0 Florida | ."
"I |0 have | |1 no | |0 idea | if that |1 is | |0 related | |1 or | |0 farmers | |1 are | |0 doing | |1 a | |0 better | |0 job | of |0 clearing | |1 out | |0 opossums | |0 now | because they |0 know | |0 opossums | |1 are | |0 carriers | , |1 but | we |1 have | n't |0 had | |1 an | |0 EPM | |0 horse | |1 in | |0 at | |0 least | |1 10 | |0 years | ."
I |1 can | |0 say | |1 all | |1 of | our |0 EPM | |0 horses | |1 were | |0 treated | |0 early | |0 when | they |1 were | |0 showing | |0 mild | |0 signs | like |0 Shee | |0 gave | |1 and | |0 all | |0 returned | |1 to | |0 racing | .
|1 One | |0 horse | |0 even | |0 got | his |0 lifetime | |0 mark | after |1 being | |0 treated | |1 for | |0 EPM | .
We |1 've | |0 always | |0 liked | |0 big | |0 long | |0 trotters | that |0 do | |0 better | |1 on | |0 mile | |0 tracks | |1 then | |1 1 | / |1 2 | |0 mile | .
|1 The | |0 only | |0 difference | we |0 noticed | |0 is | that |1 the | |0 EPM | |0 horses | |0 seemed | to |0 do | |0 worse | |1 on | |1 the | |0 smaller | |0 tracks | |0 after | .
It |1 might | |0 just | |1 be | |0 coincidence | |1 or | |1 the | |0 fact | |1 those | |0 great | |0 big | |0 trotters | |1 with | |1 those | |0 extremely | |0 long | |0 backs | |0 lost | |1 a | |0 bit | |1 of | |0 fine | |0 coordination | to |0 get | |1 those | |0 gangly | |0 bodies | |1 around | |1 those | |0 tighter | |0 turns | .
I |1 do | n't |0 know | .
|0 MSU | |0 does | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | |0 EPM | |0 studies | |1 because | of |0 how | |0 common | it |1 is | |0 here | .
You |1 may | |0 want | to |0 see | if you |1 can | |0 get | |1 in | |0 touch | |1 with | their |0 EPM | |0 group | |1 and | |0 get | |1 this | |0 guy | |1 in | |1 a | |0 study | .
I |0 know | they |0 did | |0 lab | |0 work | |0 showing | that |0 Strongid | |0 C | |0 used | |0 daily | |1 could | |0 help | |0 prevent | |0 EPM | .
"I |0 believe | they |0 have | |1 a | |0 real | |0 study | |0 testing | |1 the | |0 lab | |0 work | |1 in | |0 real | |0 world | |0 situations | |0 now | , |1 but | it |1 may | |1 be | |1 some | |0 time | before |1 those | |0 results | |1 are | |0 released | ."
|1 Another | |0 thought | with this |1 being | |1 a | |0 mosquito | |0 season | |1 from | |0 hell | |1 could | it |1 be | |0 West | |0 Nile | ?
|0 West | |0 Nile | |1 can | |0 cause | |0 EPM | |0 like | |0 symptoms | |1 and | |1 does | n't |0 always | |0 include | |1 a | |0 fever | .
|0 Let | us |0 know | what you |0 decide | to |0 do | .
"You |0 hate | to |0 see | |0 talent | |1 get | |0 wasted | , |1 but | |0 honestly | I |1 do | n't |0 think | I |1 could | |0 take | |1 in | |1 a | |0 horse | |0 right | |0 now | |1 these | |0 issues | ."
|0 Personally | I |0 think | you |1 should | |0 just | |0 keep | on |0 walking | |0 by | .
You |1 should | |0 have | you |0 chiro | |0 out | before you |0 decide | if you |0 want | |1 this | |0 horse | |1 or | not .
"If you |0 have | |1 a | |0 good | |0 repoire | ( which I |1 'm | |0 sure | you |0 do | ) |1 with | them , they |1 should | |1 be | |0 honest | on if |1 this | |0 horse | |1 is | |0 fixable | |1 to | |1 any | |0 degree | ... not |0 really | |0 sure | what you |0 want | to |0 do | |1 with | him ..."
"|0 Even | if you |1 can | |0 figure | |1 out | what |1 is | |0 wrong | |1 with | |1 this | |0 poor | |0 poneh | , there |0 is | |0 always | |1 the | |0 chance | |1 for | |0 remission | |1 and | |0 then | |0 relapse | |0 so | you |1 may | |0 have | to |0 do | |0 deal | |0 with | |0 again | |1 in | |1 the | |0 future | ."
"|0 So | |1 all | |1 in | |1 all | , |0 put | |1 the | |0 money | |1 up | |0 front | before |0 taking | |1 on | |1 this | |0 horse | ."
|1 A | |0 few | |0 hundred | |1 out | |1 of | |0 pocket | |0 now | |1 will | |0 possibly | |0 save | you |0 thousands | once |1 the | |0 horse | |1 is | |1 in | your |0 name | .
|1 Could | he |1 have | |0 had | |1 a | |0 blow | |1 to | |1 the | |0 head | |0 causing | |1 this | |0 atrophy | ?
|1 Or | |1 a | |0 difficult | |0 birth | ?
|1 Was | it |0 always | |1 like | this ?
|1 Or | |1 has | it |0 occurred | |1 since | |0 birth | .
I |0 also | |0 wonder | if he |1 might | |1 have | |0 had | |1 a | |0 slight | |0 stroke | ?
I |0 think | if you |1 can | not |0 afford | to |0 get | him |0 treated | that you |1 should | not |0 consider | him |1 as | |1 a | |0 prospect | .
"Who |0 knows | what |1 the | |0 future | |1 might | |0 hold | , |1 and | it |1 might | |1 be | |0 expensive | ?"
|0 Extremely | |0 bad | |0 customer | |0 service |
"|1 Do | not |0 go | |1 to | |1 this | |0 salon | , |0 especially | if you |0 have | to |0 get | your |0 hair | |0 straightened | ."
They |0 did | |1 a | |0 very | |0 bad | |0 job | |1 with | my |0 hair | |1 and | |1 were | |0 extremely | |0 rude | |0 when | I |0 went | |0 back | to |0 ask | them |0 why | it |1 did | n't |0 work | |1 for | my |0 hair | .

I |1 was | |0 saddened | to |0 see | |1 the | |0 reviews | that |0 claimed | |0 World | |0 Hats | |0 Mart | |0 has | |0 poor | |0 service | .
It |0 led | me to |0 believe | that |1 the | |0 reviewers | |0 simply | |0 had | |0 difficulty | |0 tolerating | |0 people | |1 with | |0 strongly | - |0 accented | |0 English | .
|1 The | |0 husband | |1 and | |0 wife | who |0 run | |1 this | |0 spot | |1 are | |0 lovely | |0 people | .

|1 This | |0 woman | |1 should | |1 be | |0 working | |1 in | |0 supercuts | ... if that .

|0 Napa | |1 is | |0 all | |1 about | |0 wine | |1 but | |0 gives | |0 very | |0 short | |0 descriptions | |1 of | |1 the | |0 wines | |1 on | their |0 lists | .
I |0 found | my |0 initial | |0 selection | |0 satisfactory | |1 but | |1 the | |0 wine | |0 flight | we |0 chose | to |0 be | |0 poorly | |0 composed | .

|1 The | |0 facilities | |1 are | |0 more | |1 than | |0 adequate | |1 and | |1 the | |0 staff | |1 are | |0 just | |0 phenomenal | .

"|0 Coming | |1 from | |1 a | |0 person | who |0 hates | |1 the | |0 dentist | |1 in | |0 general | , |0 Dr. | |0 Taylor | |1 was | |1 the | |0 best | !"
He |0 really | |0 made | |1 the | |0 visit | |1 a | |0 pain | |0 free | |0 one | |1 with | |0 excellent | |0 service | !
I |1 would | |0 recommend | him |1 to | everyone !
|0 HORRIBLE |
|1 This | |0 school | |1 is | |1 the | |0 worst | |1 one | i |1 've | |0 ever | |0 been | |1 to | .
"I |0 attended | it |1 for | |1 2 | |0 years | , |1 and | that |1 was | |0 enough | ."
"There |0 's | |0 holes | |0 everywhere | |1 in | |1 the | |0 ceiling | , |0 sewage | |0 constantly | |0 leaks | |1 through | |1 the | |0 ceiling | , |1 and | |1 the | |0 whole | |0 condition | |1 of | |1 the | |0 school | |1 is | |0 horrible | ."
"|1 The | |0 staff | |1 and | |1 the | |0 Principal | |1 are | |0 rediculous | , they |1 do | n't |0 listen | |1 to | |1 any | |0 input | , |1 and | they |0 make | |1 up | |0 rediculous | |0 rules | ( They |0 banned | |0 backpacks | , because |1 a | |0 teacher | |0 TRIPPED | |1 OVER | |1 a | |0 student | 's ) ."
"|1 The | |0 education | |1 is | |0 horrible | |0 at | |0 best | , |0 do | |0 society | |1 a | |0 favor | , |1 and | |1 do | NOT |0 send | your |0 student | |0 here | ."
|0 Excellent | |0 customer | |0 service | |1 and | |0 quality | |0 work | .
They |0 went | |1 the | |0 extra | |0 mile | to |0 repair | my |0 cowboy | |0 boots | -- they |0 had | to |0 have | |1 a | |0 special | |0 kind | |1 of | |0 paper | that |0 looked | |1 like | |0 wood | |0 grain | to |0 fix | |1 the | |0 heels | .
That |1 was | |1 4 | |0 years | |0 ago | .
I |1 have | n't |1 been | |0 able | to |0 find | |1 a | |0 shoe | |0 repair | |0 place | |1 in | |0 Seattle | |0 since | that |1 has | |1 been | |0 able | to |0 do | it .
( I |1 've | |1 been | |1 through | |0 at | |0 least | |1 5 | |0 places | |0 already | . )
"If I |0 had | |0 time | to |0 drive | |1 to | |0 Tacoma | before they |0 closed | |1 during | |1 the | |0 work | |0 week | , I |1 would | |0 just | so I |1 could | |0 get | |1 those | |0 boots | |0 fixed | |0 properly | |0 again | ."
|0 So | |0 Handy | |1 for | |0 Local | |0 La | |0 Jolla | |0 Stuff | - |0 Especially | for |0 Finding | |0 Residential | |0 Numbers |
"Since |0 moving | |0 back | |1 from | |0 college | |1 and | |0 trying | to |0 settle | |0 roots | |1 in | |1 the | |0 Village | , I |1 have | |0 referred | |1 to | |1 the | |0 La | |0 Jolla | |0 Blue | |0 Book | |1 for | |1 a | |0 ton | |1 of | |0 local | |0 numbers | ."
|1 The | |0 white | |0 pages | |0 allowed | me to |0 get | |1 in | |0 touch | |1 with | |0 parents | |1 of | my |0 high | |0 school | |0 friends | so that I |1 could | |0 track | |0 people | |1 down | |1 one | |1 by | |1 one | |1 and | |1 the | |0 restaurant | |0 section | |1 is | |0 basically | my |0 cookbook | .
It |1 's | |0 really | |0 cool | that |0 so | |0 many | |0 local | |0 businesses | |1 are | |0 found | |0 so | |0 quickly | |1 in | |1 one | |0 place | |1 and | I |0 want | to |0 spread | |1 the | |0 word | .
|0 THX | :-)
"|1 The | |0 staff | |1 do | |0 occasionally | |0 get | |0 game | |0 info | |0 correct | , |1 but | if you |1 r | |0 looking | |1 fot | |1 a | |0 good | |0 game | |1 and | |1 are | n't |1 a | |0 nerd | , |1 do | nt |0 ask | them ."
|1 The | |0 last | |0 time | I |0 did | that I |1 was | |0 suggested | to |0 buy | |0 oblivion | |0 when | I |0 told | them I |1 was | |0 looking | |1 for | |1 a | |0 fps | .
I |0 knew | what it |1 was | |1 and | |0 told | |1 the | |0 guy | that it |1 was | n't |1 a | |0 fps | .
He |0 tried | to |0 tell | me it |0 was | |0 when | I |0 told | |0 asked | him if he |0 knew | what |0 fps | |0 stood | |1 for | |1 and | he |0 had | |1 no | |0 clue | .
|0 Overall | they |1 are | n't |0 very | |0 knowledge | |1 about | |1 the | |0 type | |1 of | |0 games | |1 are | |1 on | |1 the | |0 market | .
|0 First | |1 and | |0 Last | |0 time | we |1 'll | |0 eat | |0 there |
My |0 friend | |1 and | I |0 went | |0 there | |1 for | |0 lunch | |0 today | .
|1 Neither | |0 one | |1 of | us |1 had | |0 ever | |1 been | - |0 so | we |0 thought | we |1 'd | |0 try | it .
|0 BIG | |0 MISTAKE | - |1 The | |0 food | |1 was | |0 tasteless | |1 and | |0 cold | .
We |1 both | |0 kept | |0 trying | to |0 find | something we |0 liked | .
"|1 The | |0 only | |0 thing | I |0 found | |0 edible | |1 were | |1 the | |0 potato | |0 wedges | , I |0 finally | |0 gave | |1 up | , he |0 kept | |0 trying | - he |0 found | |1 the | |0 fried | |0 wantons | to |1 be | |0 OK | - His |0 Mongolian | |0 bowl | |1 was | |0 awful | ."
|1 Would | NOT |0 recommend | |1 this | |0 place | |1 to | anyone - |1 in | |0 fact | - |0 save | your |0 money | |1 and | |0 go | |0 somewhere | |0 else | .

|0 David | |1 is | |0 amazing |
|0 David | |1 is | |1 the | |0 most | |0 helpful | |1 and | |0 creative | |0 photographer | that I |1 have | |0 used | .
He |1 is | |0 willing | to |0 do | |1 whatever | you |0 need | |1 from | him |1 without | |0 hesitation | .
He |1 was | |0 patient | |1 and | |0 adapted | |0 when | everything |1 did | n't |0 go | |0 according | |1 to | |0 schedule | |1 on | my |0 wedding | |0 day | .
|1 Both | |1 the | |0 engagement | |1 and | |0 wedding | |0 pictures | that he |0 took | |1 for | us |0 we | |0 absolutely | |0 amazing | .
He |0 got | |1 the | |0 pictures | |0 back | |1 to | me |0 quickly | .
I |1 would | |0 highly | |0 recommend | |0 David | |1 to | anyone .
He |1 will | |0 exceed | your |0 expectations | !
He |1 does | n't |0 just | |0 take | |0 pictures | he |0 makes | |0 art | |1 out | |1 of | them |1 and | you |1 wo | n't |0 even | |0 notice | that there |0 's | |1 a | |0 camera | |0 there | .
Not |0 so | |0 great |
My |0 husband | |0 just | |0 got | |1 a | |0 bike | |0 there | |1 as | |1 a | |0 gift | he |1 's | |0 only | |0 had | it |1 a | |0 month | .
It |1 's | |1 a | |0 nice | |0 bike | |1 and | it |0 cost | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | |0 money | .
|1 But | |0 just | |1 this | |0 week | |1 a | |0 peddle | |0 broke | .
He |0 took | it |0 back | |1 and | they |1 would | not |0 honor | |1 a | |0 warranty | |1 and | |0 said | it |1 was | his |0 fault | |1 because | |1 of | his |0 shoes | ??
|0 So | they |1 were | |0 going | to |0 charge | him |1 for | |0 new | |0 peddles | |1 and | |0 proceeded | to |0 put | them |0 on | without |0 even | |0 telling | him |1 the | |0 price | .
Which |1 was | |0 very | |0 expensive | .
He |0 asked | |1 for | |1 a | |0 different | |0 pair | |0 instead | |1 and | they |0 only | |0 gave | him |1 five | |0 dollars | |0 off | ??
|0 Trek | |1 is | not |0 so | |0 great |
|0 Only | |0 Concerned | |1 With | |0 Money |
I |1 have | |1 been | |0 getting | my |0 treatments | |1 for | |1 a | |0 few | |0 months | |0 now | |1 and | |1 have | |0 seen | |1 some | |0 results | |1 but | |0 not | |1 up | |1 to | |1 the | |0 standards | that I |1 was | |0 told | I |1 should | |0 expect | .
"|1 The | |0 people | |0 there | |0 attempt | to |0 come | |0 across | |1 and | |0 professional | |1 and | |0 nice | , |1 but | I |1 was | |0 disappointed | |1 with | their |0 customer | |0 service | ."
"|0 Never | |0 miss | |1 an | |0 appointment | because they |1 will | |0 charge | you |1 the | |0 price | |1 of | |1 a | |0 treatment | , |0 even | if you |0 had | |1 an | |0 emergency | ."
It |1 's | |0 pretty | |0 ridiculous | !
They |0 want | to |0 squeeze | |0 as | |0 much | as they |1 can | |1 from | you |0 even | if you |0 just | |0 got | |1 in | |1 a | |0 car | |0 accident | !!!!
They |1 do | n't |0 care | |1 one | |0 bit | |1 about | you !!!!!
|0 Terrible | |0 service | !!!
|0 Made | |1 an | |0 appointment | to |0 have | them |0 come | |1 to | |1 the | |0 house | to |0 discuss | |0 curtain | |0 options | |1 and | |0 give | |1 an | |0 estimate | .
They |0 sent | |1 over | someone who |0 said | he |0 knows | nothing |1 about | |0 curtains | |1 and | |1 could | not |0 show | me |0 fabric | |0 options | |1 or | |0 give | |1 an | |0 estimate | .
"|0 When | I |0 called | |1 the | |0 manager | to |0 complain | , she |0 said | she |0 KNEW | |1 the | |0 guy | |1 did | n't |0 know | |1 about | |0 curtains | |1 and | that |1 the | |0 usual | |0 lady | |0 called | |0 in | |0 sick | |0 hours | |0 earlier | !"
|0 Instead | of |0 rescheduling | they |0 chose | to |0 waste | my |0 time | |0 instead | .
|0 So | what |1 was | |1 the | |0 point | |1 of | |1 the | |0 appointment | !?!
To |0 just | |0 come | |0 over | |1 and | |0 hang | |1 out | ?!?
I |1 will | |0 NEVER | |0 do | |0 business | |1 with | |1 this | |0 company | !
|0 EVER | !!!

I |0 asked | |0 why | |0 so | |0 high | |1 and | they |0 said | it |1 was | |1 due | |1 to | |1 the | |0 labor | of |0 moving | |0 things | |1 out | |1 of | |1 the | |0 way | .
|1 Those | |0 things | |0 ended | |1 up | |1 being | |1 a | |0 windsheild | |0 washer | |0 fluid | |0 tank | ( |1 1 | |0 screw | ) |1 and | |1 the | |0 air | |0 filter | |0 canister | ( |1 4 | |0 spring | |0 clips | ) .

|1 A | |0 simple | |0 follow | - |1 up | |0 phone | |0 call | |1 with | |1 a | |0 woman | |0 quickly | |0 turned | |1 into | |1 a | |0 nightmare | .
She |1 may | |1 be | |1 the | |0 reason | |1 for | |1 all | |1 the | |0 change | .
I |0 sincerely | |0 wonder | if |1 the | |0 doctor | |0 has | |1 a | |0 clue | about what |1 is | |0 going | |1 on | |1 within | his |0 practice | .
If he |1 does | |0 know | |1 and | |0 approves | |1 of | |1 this | |0 behavior | |0 then | it |1 is | |1 a | |0 poor | |0 reflection | |1 on | him .
|0 Sometimes | it |1 is | not |0 worth | it to |0 go | |1 through | |1 that | |0 kind | |1 of | |0 staff | |1 and | their |0 personal | |0 attitude | to |0 get | |1 to | |1 a | |0 doctor | .

You |1 will | not |1 be | |0 disappointed | !!!!!!
|0 Outdated | |1 but | |0 not | |0 bad |
|0 So | I |0 really | |0 felt | like |1 this | |0 place | |1 was | |0 extremely | |0 outdated | |0 especially | since |1 the | |0 pictures | |0 make | it |0 look | |0 nice | |1 and | |0 modern | .
It |1 had | |0 listed | that there |0 was | |1 a | |0 hot | |0 breakfast | |1 but | |1 all | this |0 meant | |0 is | that they |0 added | |1 a | |0 waffle | |0 maker | |1 to | |1 the | |0 common | |0 continental | |0 affair | |1 at | |0 most | |0 cheap | |0 hotels | .
|1 The | |0 family | |0 suite | |1 was | |0 basically | |1 two | |0 rooms | |1 with | |1 a | |0 small | |0 opening | |1 between | them which |0 worked | |0 great | |1 for | us because we |1 were | |1 two | |0 families | |0 traveling | |0 together | .
If you |1 are | |1 in | |0 town | |1 and | |0 need | |1 that | |0 kind | |1 of | |0 space | I |0 say | |0 stay | |0 here | |1 but | if you |1 are | |0 looking | |1 for | |1 a | |0 little | |0 more | |0 upscale | |0 affair | |1 do | n't |0 let | |1 the | |0 pictures | |0 fool | you |1 and | |0 book | |0 somewhere | |0 else | .

|1 The | |0 decor | |0 left | |1 a | |0 lot | to |1 be | |0 desired | |1 and | |1 the | |0 posters | |0 telling | me |1 all | |1 the | |0 reasons | |0 99 | |1 was | |0 great | |0 just | |0 served | |1 as | |1 an | |0 ironic | |0 contrast | |1 against | |1 the | |0 reality | .
|0 Personally | I |0 recommend | you |0 take | your |0 money | |0 elsewhere |
"|0 When | I |0 arrived | |1 at | |0 Brickell | |0 Honda | |1 on | |1 6/4/11 | , I |1 was | |0 greeted | |1 and | |0 attended | |1 to | |1 by | |1 the | |0 Sales | |0 Manager | , |0 Gustavo | |0 Guerra | , |1 in | |1 a | |0 very | |0 friendly | |1 and | |0 professional | |0 manner | ."
I |0 explained | |1 to | him what I |0 wanted | |1 and | that I |0 previously | |0 went | |1 to | |0 Braman | |0 Honda | .
|0 Bramen | |0 Honda | |1 was | |1 a | |0 bit | |1 of | |1 a | |0 hassle | .
"He |0 told | me "" |1 no | |0 problem | , we |1 will | |0 match | |1 the | |0 offer | |1 or | |0 do | |0 better | . """
|0 Mr. | |0 Guerra | |0 gave | me |1 a | |0 better | |0 deal | |1 without | |1 any | |0 hassles | |1 nor | |1 any | |0 type | |1 of | |0 problems | .
|0 Brickell | |0 Honda | |1 has | |1 been | |1 the | |0 best | |0 buying | |0 experience | |1 in | |1 the | |0 world | .
I |0 urge | |1 all | |0 St. | |0 Thomas | |1 the | |0 Apostle | |0 parishioners | |1 and | |1 all | |1 of | |0 South | |0 Florida | |0 residents | to |0 come | |0 see | |0 Gus | !!!
|0 Excellent | |0 customer | |0 service | !!!
"|0 Great | , |0 Honest | |0 Service |"
I |0 took | my |1 2001 | |0 Nissan | |0 Frontier | |0 in | to |0 fix | |1 a | |0 cracked | |0 manifold | .
|1 The | |0 dealer | |0 wanted | $ |1 1300 | to |0 fix | that |1 and | |1 another | $ |1 1500 | to |0 fix | |1 some | |0 other | |0 things | .
|0 Eagle | |0 Transmission | |0 determined | that |0 much | |1 of | |1 the | |0 work | |1 the | |0 dealer | |0 said | |0 needed | to |1 be | |0 done | |1 was | |0 unneccesary | |1 and | what |0 needed | to |1 be | |0 fixed | |1 was | |0 only | $ |1 400 | !!
I |1 was | |0 so | |0 impressed | |1 with | |1 the | |0 honesty | |1 and | |0 integrity | |1 of | |0 Mike | |1 and | everyone |1 at | |0 Eagle | |0 Transmission | !
I |0 dropped | |1 the | |0 truck | |1 off | |1 in | |1 the | |0 morning | |1 and | it |1 was | |0 ready | |1 that | |0 afternoon | .
I |1 have | |0 finally | |0 found | |1 a | |0 mechanic | I |0 trust | !!
|1 And | it |1 was | |0 great | that they |1 did | not |0 charge | |1 a | |0 service | |0 fee | to |0 diagnose | |1 the | |0 problem | - |1 an | |0 added | |0 bonus | !!
|0 Dr. | |0 Shady |

"|1 After | |1 the | |0 way | she |0 spoke | |1 to | me |1 on | my |0 last | |0 visit | , I |1 will | not |1 be | |0 returning | !!"
|0 Good | |0 luck | |0 keeping | |0 business | |1 with | |1 that | |0 stuck | |1 up | |0 attitude | |0 Dr. | |0 Shady | .
You |1 have | |0 just | |0 lost | mine .
"|1 The | |0 next | |0 time | you |0 feel | like |1 being | |0 condescending | |1 to | someone , it |1 is | not |0 going | to |1 be | me !!!!!!"
|0 Dr. | |0 Shady | |1 is | |0 inexperienced | |1 and | |0 prideful | .
She |0 probably | |1 does | not |0 even | |0 have | |1 10 | % |1 of | |1 the | |0 knowledge | that |1 some | |1 of | |1 the | |0 other | |0 EXPERIENCED | |0 vets | |0 do | |1 in | |1 this | |0 area | .

"|0 Beautifully | |0 written | |0 reviews | |0 Doctor | , |1 but | |0 completely | |0 UNTRUE | ."
|0 Poor | |0 Experience |
I |1 did | not |0 have | |1 a | |0 good | |0 experience | |1 w | / |0 Dr. | |0 Ghassemlou | .
"|1 During | |1 the | |0 session | , he |0 demanded | to |0 have | my |0 physical | |0 address | , which I |1 've | |0 always | |0 kept | |0 private | as I |1 am | |0 enrolled | |1 in | |1 a | |0 witness | |0 protection | |0 program | ."
"I |0 believe | he |1 is | |0 correct | in |1 that | he |0 needs | my |0 physical | |0 address | |1 for | |0 legal | |0 reasons | , |0 however | , he |1 did | not |0 adequately | |0 explain | this |1 during | our |0 session | ."
I |0 learned | |0 more | |1 about | this |0 doing | my |0 own | |0 research | |0 afterward | .
I |0 think | he |1 could | |1 've | |0 done | |0 more | to |0 assuage | my |0 concerns | by |0 giving | me |0 concrete | |0 facts | .
|0 Saying | that I |0 need | to |0 give | him my |0 address | |1 or | |0 else | I |0 have | |0 intimacy | |0 issues | |1 is | not |0 helpful | .

I |1 have | |0 had | my |0 back | |0 fused | |1 in | |1 2 | |0 places | .

He |0 really | |0 knows | what he |1 is | |0 talking | |1 about | |1 and | |1 will | |0 approach | |1 the | |0 different | |0 options | |0 fairly | .
"You |1 can | |0 see | |0 different | |0 treatments | that |1 a | |0 surgeon | |1 ca | n't |0 see | , so that you |1 can | |0 have | |0 several | |0 treatment | |0 options | before you |0 decide | what to |0 do | ."

I |0 think | |1 90 | |0 percent | |1 of | |1 the | |0 tenants | |1 are | |0 smokers | !
"If you |1 do | not |0 smoke | , |1 do | not |0 move | |0 here | ."

they |0 seemed | |0 more | |0 interested | in |0 helping | me |0 find | |1 the | |0 right | |0 car | |0 rather | |1 then | |0 just | |0 make | |1 a | |0 sale | .
"my |0 experience | |1 with | them |1 was | |0 great | - |0 low | |0 stress | , |0 very | |0 helpful | |1 and | |0 very | |0 personal | ."

|1 This | |0 insurance | |0 co. | |1 Is | |1 a | |0 joke | !!!

They |1 will | |0 make | |1 every | |0 attempt | to |0 misinform | |1 and | |0 misrepresent | themselves .
They |0 make | |1 up | |0 excuses | |1 in | |0 hopes | to |0 confuse | their |0 policy | |0 holders | |1 with | |0 misinformation | .

I |0 shopped | it |0 around | |1 and | they |1 were | |0 extremely | |0 competitive | |1 in | |0 pricing | |1 and | |0 also | |0 added | |0 nitrogen | |1 to | my |0 tires | which |1 should | |0 extend | |1 the | |0 life | |1 and | |0 get | me |0 better | |0 gas | |0 mileage | .

|0 Very | |0 high | |0 pressured | |0 sales | |1 and | |1 with | |1 the | |0 reviews | |1 of | |0 many | |0 others | |0 bad | |0 service | .
I |1 'm | |0 glad | I |0 trusted | my |0 gut | |1 and | |1 did | n't |1 get | |0 sucked | into |0 doing | |0 business | |1 with | them .

|1 The | |0 best | |0 part | |0 is | I |0 got | my |0 whole | |0 bathroom | |0 remodeled | |1 for | |0 about | |1 the | |0 same | |0 price | |1 the | |0 other | |0 company's | |1 were | |0 quoting | |0 just | to |0 fix | |1 the | |0 shower | |0 tile | |1 and | |0 fixtures | .
They |0 had | |1 the | |0 work | |0 done | |1 in | |0 about | |1 half | |1 the | |0 time | |0 quoted | which |0 made | me |1 and | my |0 wife | |0 extremely | |0 happy | .
We |1 have | |0 had | nothing |1 but | |0 compliments | |1 on | our |0 bathroom | |0 when | |0 guest | |0 come | |0 over | - who |1 would | |1 have | |0 guessed | |1 that | |0 one | ?
|0 Very | |0 nice | |0 work | |1 and | |0 friendly | |0 guys | |0 too | .
|0 Best | |0 money | I |1 've | |0 spent | |1 on | |0 remodeling | |0 ever | .
I |0 highly | |0 recommend | |1 any | |0 one | |0 considering | |0 home | |0 repair | to |0 give | |1 these | |0 guys | |1 a | |0 call | .
|0 New | |0 training | |0 Centre | |1 is | |0 excellent |

We |1 have | |0 attended | A |0 Ward | |0 Dance | |0 Centre | |1 for | |1 over | |1 a | |0 year | |1 and | |0 really | |0 enjoy | |1 the | |0 friendly | |1 and | |0 welcoming | |0 way | we |1 are | |0 taught | |0 Ballroom | |1 and | |0 Latin | |0 as | |0 well | |1 as | |1 the | |0 fun | |0 filled | |0 social | |0 dance | |0 evening | |0 held | |1 every | |0 Saturday | |0 evening | ....
"It |1 is | not |0 really | |0 possible | to |0 score | |1 this | |0 school | |0 too | |0 highly | , We |1 would | |0 give | it |1 12 | |1 out | |1 of | |1 10 | |1 and | |1 5 | |0 Stars | |1 across | |1 the | |0 board | |0 Steve | |1 & | |0 Anne |"
I |0 purchased | |1 a | |1 2 | - |0 year | |0 old | |0 certified | |0 pre-owned | |0 BMW | |1 from | |1 this | |0 dealership | .
"|1 The | |0 night | I |0 drove | |0 back | |0 home | , I |0 found | that |1 the | |0 rear | |0 window | |0 has | |1 some | |0 leakage | ."
( You |1 can | |0 hear | |1 the | |0 wind | while |0 driving | |1 on | |0 highway | .
|0 Very | |0 likely | it |0 needs | |1 a | |0 new | |0 window | |0 seal | ) .
I |0 admit | that I |1 should | |1 have | |0 paid | |0 attention | |1 to | |1 this | |0 kind | |1 of | |0 little | |0 things | while |0 test | |0 drive | .
( |1 But | this |1 is | |1 a | |0 certified | |0 car | |1 from | |1 a | |0 dealer | . )
|0 So | I |0 brought | |1 the | |0 car | |0 back | |1 the | |0 second | |0 day | .
They |0 told | me that this |1 is | not |1 under | |0 warranty | |1 and | |0 want | to |0 charge | me $ |1 175 | |0 just | to |0 diagnose | |1 the | |0 problem | !
Who |0 knows | |0 how | |0 much | they |0 want | me to |0 pay | to |0 fix | |1 this | |0 thing | .
I |0 walked | |0 away | .
|0 So | my |0 advice | |1 is | that |0 NEVER | |0 TRUST | |1 THIS | |0 DEALER | .
|0 STAY | |0 AWAY | |0 AS | |0 FAR | AS |0 POSSIBLE | .
|0 Perfect | |0 Practice |
After I |1 had | |0 chosen | |1 The | |0 Fountain | |0 Dental | |0 Practice | they |0 provided | |1 a | |0 slick | |1 and | |0 professional | |0 service | |1 from | |0 start | |1 to | |0 finish | .
"Everyone |1 was | |0 friendly | |1 from | |1 the | |0 receptionist | |1 to | |1 the | |0 surgeon | herself , |0 putting | me |1 at | my |0 ease | |1 and | |0 explaining | |1 the | |0 whole | |0 process | , |1 both | |0 initially | |1 and | |0 then | as we |0 went | |0 along | ."
|0 Surgery | |0 visit | |0 timings | |1 were | |0 always | |0 made | to |0 suit | me |1 and | |0 not | them |1 and | they |0 gave | me |1 the | |0 feeling | that I |0 mattered | |1 and | |1 was | |0 important | |1 to | them .
"|1 The | |0 surgery | itself |1 is | |0 slick | , |0 modern | |1 and | |0 very | |0 relaxed | |1 and | I |0 always | |0 felt | that I |1 was | |1 in | |0 capable | |0 hands | ."
"My |0 dental | |0 surgeon | , |0 Dr. | |0 Lucy | |0 Nichols | |1 is | |0 clearly | |1 a | |0 dental | |0 perfectionist | |1 and | |0 clearly | |0 proud | |1 both | |1 of | |1 the | |0 work | she |0 does | |1 and | |1 the | |0 reputation | she |1 has | |0 established | ."

"|0 Even | though we |1 were | |0 only | |0 supposed | to |0 have | |1 those | |0 specific | |0 types | |1 of | |0 pizza | , |0 when | |0 guests | |0 asked | |1 for | |1 a | |0 different | |0 type | , it |1 was | |0 brought | |0 out | |1 with | |1 no | |0 charge | |1 to | us !"

I |0 go | |1 to | |0 school | |1 in | |1 the | |0 area | |1 and | |0 usually | |0 wait | until I |0 go | |0 home | to |0 get | my |0 hair | |0 cut | .
I |0 decided | it |1 was | |0 time | to |0 grow | |1 up | |1 and | |0 made | |1 an | |0 appointment | .
|0 Sierra | |1 was | my |0 stylist | |1 and | i |0 love | what she |0 did | .

It |1 was | |1 the | |0 first | |0 time | i |1 had | |0 left | |1 a | |0 salon | with my |0 hair | |0 curly | .
|0 Usually | they |0 blow | |0 dry | it |1 out | |1 and | i |0 have | to |0 wait | until i |0 wash | it to |0 see | what it |1 will | |0 look | |1 like | |1 in | its |0 natural | |0 state | .
|1 But | she |0 did | |1 a | |0 fabulous | |0 job | |0 letting | me |0 know | what she |1 was | |0 doing | |1 at | |1 all | |0 times | |1 and | |0 styled | my |0 hair | |1 in | |1 a | |0 way | i |1 could | |0 do | it |1 at | |0 home | .

I |0 left | |1 with | |1 a | |0 case | |1 of | |0 BRAWLER | !!!! !
|0 Oil | |0 Change | |0 Disaster |
My |0 wife | |1 had | |0 taken | her |1 '07 | |0 Ford | |0 Fusion | |0 in | |1 for | |1 a | |0 routine | |0 oil | |0 change | .
"|1 A | |0 couple | |0 days | |1 after | |1 the | |0 oil | |0 change | , |1 the | |0 engine | |0 ran | |0 rough | , |1 the | |0 low | |0 oil | |0 pressure | |0 light | |1 would | |0 come | |1 on | |0 sporadically | , |1 and | |1 the | |0 engine | |1 would | |0 whir | |0 loudly | ."
"|0 Turns | |1 out | |1 the | |0 engine | |0 had | |1 no | |0 oil | , |1 and | |0 when | |0 oil | |1 was | |0 put | |0 it | , it |1 would | |0 just | |0 run | |1 out | |1 of | |1 the | |0 filter | ."
There |1 could | |0 have | ( |0 hopefully | |1 does | n't |0 have | ) |0 major | |0 damage | |1 to | |1 the | |0 engine | .
|1 All | |1 of | this |0 started | |1 after | their |0 oil | |0 change | .
Once they |0 realized | their |0 mistake | they |0 sent | |1 a | |0 mechanic | |1 and | |0 tow | |0 truck | |1 to | my |0 wife | 's |0 work | |1 and | |0 towed | it |0 back | to |0 fix | it .
"I |1 would | not |0 recommend | |1 this | |0 shop | |1 for | anything , |0 not | |0 even | something |0 as | |0 simple | |1 as | |1 an | |0 oil | |0 change | ."
"|1 Plus | they |1 will | |0 overcharge | you |1 for | |0 just | |0 about | everything , |1 and | |0 smile | while |0 doing | it ."
"|0 Liars | , |0 negative | |0 stars | !"
|0 Took | my |0 Cruze | |0 in | |0 twice | |1 for | |0 poor | |0 fuel | |0 economy | .
|1 The | |0 first | |0 time | they |0 claimed | to |0 get | |0 reasonable | |0 mpg | .
"|0 However | , they |1 would | |0 never | |0 drive | |1 the | |0 car | with me |1 in | it to |0 prove | their |0 findings | ."
I |0 wonder | if they |1 were | |0 going | |1 down | |1 a | |0 hill | !
They |0 told | me to |0 bring | it |0 back | |1 after | |1 5000 | |0 miles | .
I |0 brought | it |0 back | |1 with | |1 9000 | |0 miles | .
"They "" |0 finished | "" |1 the | |0 work | |1 and | |0 told | me |1 the | |0 car | |1 was | |0 ready | ."
"I |0 found | |1 out | they |1 did | not |0 even | |0 drive | |1 the | |0 car | , |0 stated | they |0 looked | |1 at | it |0 before | ."
They |0 still | |1 would | not |0 drive | |1 the | |0 car | |1 with | me to |0 show | their |0 mpg | |0 number | .
"They |0 also | |0 claimed | |0 not | to |0 see | anything |0 wrong | |1 with | |1 the | |0 blower | |0 fan | ( |1 a | |0 seperate | |0 issue | ) , |1 but | |0 when | I |0 drove | |1 the | |0 car | |0 home | I |0 had | |1 the | |0 same | |0 symptoms | ."
I |1 will | |0 never | |0 purchace | |1 another | |0 vehicle | |1 from | |0 Vic | |0 Canever | .
|0 Great | |0 Job |
I |0 want | to |0 say | that |0 Mike | |0 did | |1 a | |0 great | |0 job | |1 for | our |0 family | |1 in | our |0 time | |1 of | |0 need | .
|1 Both | my |0 grandparents | |0 passed | |0 away | |1 4 | |0 months | |0 apart | |1 and | |0 Mike | |1 was | |0 very | |0 understanding | .
It |1 was | |1 a | |0 very | |0 trying | |0 time | |1 for | my |0 family | |1 and | myself |1 yet | |0 Mike | |0 took | |1 the | |0 time | to |0 greet | |1 each | |1 and | |1 every | |1 one | |1 one | |1 of | us .
He |1 is | |0 very | |0 professional | |1 in | his |0 position | |1 as | |1 a | |0 director | |1 and | |1 yet | he |0 still | |0 made | |0 time | to |1 be | |0 compassionate | for what we |1 were | |0 all | |0 going | |1 through | .
I |1 'm | |0 sure | it |1 s | not |1 every | |0 day | that |1 a | |0 funeral | |0 director | |0 sees | |1 the | |0 same | |0 family | |1 in | |1 such | |1 a | |0 short | |0 time | .
"My |0 grandfather | |0 passed | |0 away | |0 silently | |1 in | his |0 sleep | , |1 and | my |0 grandmother | |0 passed | |0 away | |1 after | |1 a | |0 short | |0 struggle | |1 with | |0 cancer | ."
|1 Both | my |0 grandparents | |0 looked | |0 as | |0 natural | as |1 could | |1 be | |0 expected | .
|0 Thank | you |0 Mike | |1 for | |1 all | your |0 help | |0 professionally | |1 and | |0 personally | .

"If you |0 like | |1 the | |0 drama | |0 described | |1 in | |0 popular | |0 sitcom | ' |0 Seinfeld | ' , you |1 will | |0 see | it |0 here | ."
We |0 signed | our |0 name | |1 in | |0 about | |1 6:00 | |0 pm | .
There |0 were | |1 3 | |0 names | |1 before | us .
|1 The | |0 greeter | |0 said | there |0 was | |0 about | |1 15 | |0 minutes | |0 waiting | .
"|0 However | , we |0 waited | |1 and | |0 waited | |1 and | |1 in | |1 the | mean |0 time | , |0 saw | |1 4 | |0 groups | |1 of | |0 people | |0 simply | |0 just | |0 paraded | |0 in | without |0 signing | there |0 names | ."
"|1 This | |0 sign | |1 in | |0 policy | |1 is | |0 posted | |1 by | |1 the | |0 restaurant | “ |1 no | |0 reservation | , |0 sign | your |0 name | |0 here | ” ."
"I |0 had | to |0 ask | |1 the | |0 greeter | , he |0 explained | his |0 reasons | |1 with | |0 broken | |0 English | ."
I |1 could | not |0 understand | |1 any | his |0 reasons | .
I |1 could | |0 only | |0 take | it as they |1 would | |0 seat | |1 the | |0 people | they |0 know | |0 first | .
My |0 conclusion | |0 is | that you |1 should | |0 only | |0 go | |0 there | if you |0 want | to |0 wait | |0 a | |0 least | |1 an | |0 hour | |1 and | |0 see | |1 all | |0 kinds | |0 other | |0 people | |1 being | |0 seated | |1 before | you .

|1 This | |0 place | |1 is | |0 marginal | |0 at | |0 best | .
|0 Not | |0 very | |0 welcoming | |1 and | |0 focused | |0 mostly | on |0 keeping | |0 little | |0 kids | |0 entertained | .

"I |0 understand | |0 not | |0 wanting | to |0 put | |0 labels | |1 like | |1 5.10 | |1 on | |1 an | |0 indoor | |0 course | , because |0 yes | , it |1 is | not |1 the | |0 same | , |1 but | |1 some | |0 clear | |0 understanding | |1 of | |1 the | |0 difficulty | |1 of | |1 one | |0 course | |1 to | |1 another | |1 is | |0 nice | |0 when | you |1 are | |1 an | |0 intermediate | |0 climber | |0 looking | to |0 improve | ."

|0 Best | |0 DJ's | |1 In | |0 Town | !
|0 Wow | !
|1 These | |0 guys | |1 were | |1 the | |0 best | .
"They |1 were | |0 thorough | , |0 high | |0 class | , |1 and | |0 went | |0 above | |1 and | |0 beyond | ."
"We |0 never | |0 had | to |0 worry | |1 about | |1 a | |0 thing | , |1 and | they |0 led | |1 the | |0 way | |1 the | |0 whole | |0 time | ."
"They |0 asked | us |0 things | that we |1 would | |1 have | |0 never | |1 have | |0 thought | |1 of | , |1 and | |0 took | |0 extra | |0 time | to |0 meet | |1 with | us |0 when | we |0 needed | it |1 before | |1 the | |0 wedding | ."
|0 Having | |1 a | |0 team | |1 was | |1 the | |0 best | because they |0 kept | |1 the | |0 flow | |1 of | |1 the | |0 wedding | |0 going | |1 the | |0 whole | |0 time | !
"They |1 may | |0 look | |0 young | |1 but | |1 do | n't |0 let | that |0 fool | you , as their |0 knowledge | |1 of | |0 music | |0 far | |0 surpassed | what we |0 expected | ."

|0 So | we |1 did | n't |0 expect | them to |0 even | |0 know | |1 some | |1 of | |1 the | |0 requests | that we |0 asked | |1 that | |0 night | .
They |0 just | |0 really | |0 know | their |0 stuff | !
|0 NEVER | |0 fear | |0 going | |1 to | |1 the | |0 dentist | |0 again | !

|1 By | |1 the | |0 age | |1 of | |1 24 | I |0 stopped | |0 going | |1 to | |1 the | |0 dentist | .
My |0 fear | |1 and | |0 discomfort | |1 from | |0 dental | |0 work | |0 scared | me !
It |0 took | |1 all | |1 the | |0 courage | I |1 could | |0 muster | to |0 make | |1 an | |0 appointment | .
"|1 At | |1 the | |0 front | |0 door | |1 of | his |0 office | , I |0 nearly | |0 turned | |0 around | ."
I |0 considered | |0 just | |0 leaving | after |0 going | |0 inside | |1 and | |0 nearly | |1 did | .
|0 Doctor | |0 Gonzales | |1 and | his |0 entire | |0 staff | |1 are | |1 the | |0 most | |0 professional | |0 people | I |1 have | |0 ever | |0 dealt | |1 with | .
"They |0 made | me |0 feel | |0 confident | in what they |1 would | |0 do | , |1 and | |0 treated | me |1 like | |1 a | |0 member | |1 of | their |0 own | |0 family | ."
I |0 never | |0 felt | |0 pain | |1 or | |0 discomfort | .
|1 The | |0 ability | to |0 smile | |1 and | |0 eat | |0 again | |1 can | |0 only | |1 be | |0 described | |1 as | |1 a | |0 whole | |0 new | |0 lease | |1 on | |0 life | .

"|0 not | |0 only | |1 is | |1 this | |0 place | |0 too | |0 expensive | for what it |0 is | , it |1 s | |0 horrible | !"
"|1 In | |1 the | |0 past | , I |0 got | |1 a | |0 steak | |1 and | there |0 was | |0 more | |0 fat | |1 and | |0 rough | |0 pieces | than there |0 was | |0 good | |0 steak | ( |1 and | this |1 was | |1 the | |0 sirloin | ! ) , |1 the | |0 sides | |1 were | |0 drenched | |1 with | |0 butter | |1 and | |1 the | |0 salad | |1 was | |1 a | |0 little | |1 on | |1 the | |0 brown | |0 side | ."

It |0 took | |0 over | |1 1.5 | |0 hours | for our |0 food | to |0 come | |0 out | |1 and | |1 by | |1 that | |0 time | my |1 8 | |0 month | |0 old | |0 had | it !
|1 Does | it |0 seriously | |0 take | |0 that | |0 long | |1 for | |1 a | |0 soup | |1 and | |0 salad | ?

|0 Texas | |0 Roadhouse | |1 is | |0 WAY | |0 better | !!
|0 Spay | |1 and | |0 neuter | |0 service | .

"My |0 vet | |0 even | |0 said | it |1 was | not my |0 fault | it |1 was | |1 the | |0 vet | that |0 did | |1 the | |0 surgery | , |0 So | I |1 would | not |0 recommend | |0 getting | |1 that | |0 program | unless you |0 have | |1 an | |0 extra | |1 hundred | |0 dollars | |1 or | |0 so | |1 for | |0 antibiotics | |1 and | |1 a | |0 vet | |0 visit | ."
You |1 'd | |0 think | they |1 would | |0 do | |1 a | |0 good | |0 job | |1 but | they |1 do | n't |0 care | unless they |1 are | |1 getting | |0 paid | |0 full | |0 price | .
Which |1 is | |0 so | |0 dumb | .
|0 Not | to |0 mention | |1 the | |0 fact | that they |0 gave | us our |0 cats | |0 back | |0 not | |0 even | |1 30 | |0 minutes | after they |1 were | |0 out | |1 from | |0 surgery | .
|0 Billing | |0 Issues | ...
I |0 had | |1 a | |0 routine | |0 surgery | |1 for | |1 an | |0 ingrown | |0 toenail | .
"My |0 insurance | |0 company | , |0 Blue | |0 Cross | / |0 Blue | |0 Shield | |0 paid | |1 the | |0 fees | |1 and | everything |1 was | |0 fine | ."
|0 Then | I |0 got | |1 a | |0 bill | |1 for | $ |1 483.00 | .
"|1 The | |0 doctor | 's |0 office | |0 said | that |0 payments | |1 had | |1 been | "" |0 reversed | "" ."
|0 Blue | |0 cross | |0 has | |1 no | |0 record | |1 of | |1 aa | |0 reversal | .
|1 The | |0 office | |0 refused | my |0 requests | to |0 see | what they |0 got | |1 from | |0 BC | / |0 BS | .
They |0 eventually | |0 turned | it |1 over | |1 to | |1 a | |0 collection | |0 agency | |1 and | |0 now | |1 will | not |0 even | |0 discuss | |1 the | |0 matter | .
"I |0 eventually | |0 decided | to |0 just | |0 pay | |1 the | |0 balance | |0 even | though |1 the | |0 doctor | |1 has | |0 already | |1 been | |0 paid | , |1 but | |0 now | |1 the | |0 collection | |0 agency | |1 is | |0 trying | to |0 say | |1 another | |0 reversal | |1 of | $ |1 160.00 | |1 has | |0 come | |0 through | ."
It |1 was | |1 an | |0 ingrown | |0 toenail | .
|0 How | |0 much | |1 could | it |0 possibly | |0 cost | ?
"|0 Not | |0 only | |1 am | I |1 being | |0 bilked | |1 for | |0 money | I |1 do | not |0 owe | , |1 the | |0 office | |0 staff | |1 is | |0 rude | to |0 boot | ."

"We |1 have | |1 been | |0 blessed | to |0 find | |0 Elite | |0 Flyers | |0 online | |1 and | |1 would | not |0 use | anyone |0 else | to |0 handle | our |0 postcards | , |0 posters | , etc ."
We |1 were | |0 looking | |1 for | |1 a | |0 company | |1 with | |0 decent | |0 rates | as our |0 company | |1 was | |0 just | |1 getting | |0 started | .

"|1 On | |1 one | |0 order | , we |0 needed | it |0 rushed | |1 and | |0 shipped | |1 to | |1 a | |0 different | |0 state | ."

I |0 also | |0 appreciate | their |0 honesty | .
I |0 sent | |1 a | |0 graphic | that |1 would | |1 have | |1 been | |0 distorted | if |0 printed | as it |0 was | .
They |0 called | |1 and | |0 worked | |1 with | me to |0 fix | it so that it |1 would | |0 look | |0 perfect | .

"I |0 ordered | |1 1000 | |0 postcards | , we |0 normally | |0 order | |1 5000 | |1 or | |0 more | ."
"Because they |0 had | |0 room | to |0 do | |1 5000 | , they |0 created | |1 the | |0 larger | |0 amount | , |1 and | |0 shipped | them |0 early | ."

|0 Well | I |0 think | |1 a | |0 blown | |0 engine | |0 falls | |1 under | |1 the | |0 catagory | |1 of | |0 mechanics | |0 right | ?
|0 Anyway | they |0 jimmy | |0 rigged | it so i |1 could | |0 drive | it |0 home | .

I |1 am | |1 a | |0 proud | |0 owner | |1 of | |1 a | |0 brand | |0 new | |1 2010 | |0 Hyundai | |0 Genesis | .
I |1 have | |0 never | |0 seen | |1 this | |0 car | |0 before | until |1 this | |0 lady | |1 at | |0 wal | |0 mart | |0 had | it |1 and | she |0 told | me she |0 got | it |0 here | |1 and | that everyone |1 was | |0 so | |0 nice | |1 to | her .
I |0 asked | her who she |0 worked | |1 with | |1 and | she |0 just | |0 told | me ti |1 was | |1 the | |0 sales | |0 manager | .
"I |0 took | |1 the | |0 weekend | |1 off | |1 and | |0 came | |0 in | |1 and | |0 asked | |1 for | |1 the | |0 manager | who |1 is | |0 Jeff | |1 and | he |0 remembered | her |0 right | |0 away | |0 even | |0 remembered | her |0 dog | , I |1 was | |1 a | |0 bit | |0 shocked | that someone |1 would | |0 pay | |0 that | |0 close | |0 attention | ."
"We |0 got | to |0 talking | |1 and | he |0 got | me |0 set | |1 up | |1 and | I |0 test | |0 drove | |1 with | |0 Craig | |1 and | I |0 fell | |0 head | |1 over | |0 heels | |1 for | |1 this | |0 car | |1 all | I |0 kept | |0 saying | , "" |0 was | I |0 got | ta |0 have | it ! """
I |0 thouhgt | it |1 would | |1 be | |1 out | |1 of | my |0 price | |0 range | |1 but | they |0 really | |0 worked | |1 with | me |1 and | |0 now | I |1 could | nt |1 be | |0 happier | .
|0 Jeff | |1 and | |0 Craig | |1 are | |0 really | |0 good | at what they |0 do | |1 and | |0 know | |0 exactly | |0 how | to |0 treat | |1 a | |0 customer | .
|0 Definitely | |0 go | |0 see | them !
"|0 Bait | |1 and | |0 switch | , |0 untrained | |0 workers |"
"|0 Called | |1 the | |0 Bonanza | |0 store | |1 2 | |0 weeks | |0 ago | , before I |0 ripped | |1 out | |1 350 | |0 sq | |0 ft | |1 of | |0 ceramic | |0 tile | ... |1 was | |0 told | I |1 would | |0 need | |1 a | "" |0 dual | |0 head | |0 concrete | |0 grinder | "" to |0 remove | |0 thinset | |1 and | |0 make | |1 a | |0 nice | "" |0 finished | "" |0 look | ( |0 ready | |1 for | |0 concrete | |0 stain | ) ."
"|1 Was | |0 quoted | $ |1 55 | |0 all | |0 inclusive | |1 of | |0 grinder | |0 inserts | , etc ."
"|1 No | |0 problem | , |0 sounded | like it |1 's | |0 done | |1 every | |0 day | ."
|1 Will | |0 look | |0 beautiful | .
"|0 Got | |1 the | |0 tile | |0 ripped | |1 out | , |0 call | |0 today | , |0 now | |0 all | |0 the | |0 sudden | |1 this | |0 grinder | |1 wo | n't |0 leave | |1 a | |0 finished | |0 look | |1 AND | it |1 's | $ |1 125 | |1 PLUS | |0 around | $ |1 75 | |1 for | |1 the | |0 inserts | ."
I |1 can | |0 rent | |1 another | |0 machine | |1 for | |0 like | $ |1 60 | that |1 will | |0 give | it |1 a | |0 finished | |0 look | .
|0 So | |1 from | $ |1 55 | |1 to | $ |1 260 | ?
|1 Are | they |0 serious | ?
I |0 feel | like they |1 did | n't |0 tell | me |1 the | |0 pitfalls | before I |0 pulled | |0 out | |1 this | |0 tile | |1 and | |0 now | that I |0 have | |1 no | |0 other | |0 options | they |0 want | |1 5 | |0 TIMES | |1 the | |0 price | ?
"|1 Either | |1 these | |0 people | |1 do | n't |0 know | anything about what they |1 are | |0 renting | , |1 or | |0 worse | - they |1 are | |0 bait | |1 and | |0 switching | ."
One |0 suspects | |1 that | |0 earlier | |0 reviewer | |0 works | |1 for | |1 another | |0 laundry | .
"|0 Outside | of |0 parking | |1 being | |1 at | |1 a | |0 premium | , |0 especially | |1 on | |0 discount | |0 days | , |1 The | |0 Laundry | |0 Tub | |1 is | not |0 filthy | |1 and | it |1 's | |0 no | |0 smaller | |1 than | |1 any | |1 of | |1 a | |0 dozen | |0 laundromats | I |1 've | |1 been | |1 in | ."
"|0 Yes | , there |0 are | |0 bigger | , |1 but | |0 bigger | |1 is | n't |0 necessarily | |0 better | ."
"I |0 availed | myself |1 of | |1 the | |0 wash | |1 'n | |0 fold | |0 service | , |0 taking | |0 just | |1 about | |1 a | |0 year | 's |0 worth | |1 of | |0 dirty | |0 clothes | |0 in | |1 and | |0 getting | |0 back | |0 neatly | |0 folded | , |0 clean | |0 clothes | |1 in | |0 clear | |0 plastic | |0 bags | ( I |1 'd | |0 originally | |0 brought | them |0 in | , |1 in | |1 six | |0 large | |0 yellow | |0 garbage | |0 bags | ) ."
|1 The | |0 cost | |1 was | |0 certainly | |0 reasonable | |1 and | I |1 will | |0 continue | my |0 patronage | |1 of | |1 The | |0 Laundry | |0 Tub | |1 in | |1 the | |0 future | .
|1 Did | n't |0 hurt | |0 any | that they |0 knew | my |0 name | |1 by | my |0 second | |0 visit | |1 and | |0 greeted | me |0 warmly | |0 then | |1 and | |1 on | my |0 third | |0 visit | .
"Whereas my |0 answer | |1 to | |1 the | |0 question | "" |0 Where | |1 do | you |0 get | your |0 laundry | |0 done | ? "" |0 used | to |1 be | , "" |1 At | |1 the | |0 checkout | |0 line | |1 at | |0 WalMart | , "" I |1 can | |0 honestly | |0 say | |1 the | |0 answer | |0 now | |0 is | , "" |1 At | |1 The | |0 Laundry | |0 Tub | .

|0 Thank | you !
I |0 recently | |0 took | |1 a | |0 rescue | |0 puppy | |1 to | |1 this | |0 Clinic | |1 and | I |1 was | |0 SHOCKED | at |0 how | |0 well | |0 Romeo | |1 and | My |0 family | |1 was | |0 treated | .
They |0 worked | |1 around | |1 the | |0 clock | to |0 ensure | that my |0 puppy | |0 life | |1 was | |0 saved | .
We |0 have | to |0 leave | him |1 at | |1 the | |0 vet | |1 for | |1 3 | |0 days | |1 and | I |1 was | |0 told | to |0 call | |1 for | |0 check | |0 ups | |0 as | |0 often | as I |0 wished | that |0 no | |0 matter | |0 how | |0 many | |0 times | I |0 called | I |1 would | not |0 annoy | them .
|0 lol | They |0 where | |0 super | |0 friendly | |1 towards | us |1 and | |0 treated | us |1 like | |0 people | |0 not | |0 walking | |0 bags | |1 of | |0 cash | .
"|1 In | |1 this | |0 day | it |1 s | |0 rare | to |0 find | |0 such | |0 wonderful | |0 people | who |0 CARE | , |0 Not | |1 the | |0 kind | |1 of | |0 want | to |0 make | |0 cash | ."
I |1 would | |0 strongly | |0 suggest | you |0 give | them |1 the | |0 chance | to |0 prove | |1 to | you that |0 not | |1 all | |0 people | |1 in | |1 this | |0 world | |1 are | |0 evil | !
I |1 will | |0 never | |0 go | |1 to | |1 another | |0 vet | |0 as | |0 long | as I |0 have | |0 animals | .
I |0 live | |0 nearly | |1 two | |0 hours | |0 away | |1 and | |1 yet | I |1 will | |0 still | |0 make | |1 the | |0 drive | to |0 see | them !
|1 In | |0 fact | I |0 look | |0 forward | to |0 taking | my |0 animals | |1 to | |1 the | |0 vet | |0 simply | |1 because | of |0 how | my |0 animals | |1 and | I |1 are | |0 treated | .
"|0 Okay | , |0 here | |1 's | |1 the | |0 scoop | ."
I |1 'm | |1 a | |0 regular | |1 at | |1 the | |0 HH | .
"|1 The | |0 food | |1 is | |0 excellent | , |1 the | |0 serivce | |1 is | |0 horrible | ."
I |0 think | they |1 're | |0 still | |1 in | |1 the | |0 mindset | from |0 when | it |1 was | |0 only | |0 smokers | |0 sitting | |0 around | |1 and | |0 drinking | ... |0 not | |1 in | |1 any | |0 hurry | .
|1 In | my |0 experience | |1 the | |0 food | |1 has | |1 been | |0 excellent | ( |1 for | |1 the | |0 most | |0 part | ) .
"|0 However | , |1 the | |0 bartenders | / |0 waitresses | |0 definately | |0 need | to |1 be | |0 re-trained | ( if they |0 ever | |0 had | |1 any | to |0 begin | |1 with | ) |1 and | |0 learn | |1 two | |0 things | : |0 only | |0 chat | |1 with | |0 customers | |0 when | |0 other | |0 customers | |1 are | not |0 impatiently | |0 waiting | |1 and | to |0 look | |0 around | |0 more | |0 often | to |0 see | if |0 people | |1 are | |0 waiting | ."
"|1 In | |1 some | |0 cases | |1 the | |0 result | |1 is | |1 because | |1 of | |0 understaffing | , |1 in | |1 some | |0 cases | |1 the | |0 staff | |0 just | |1 does | n't |0 care | / |0 know | |0 better | ."
"They |1 must | |0 also | |0 get | something to |0 keep | |0 take | - |0 out | |0 warm | , so it |1 's | not |0 room | |0 temperature | |0 at | |0 best | |0 when | you |0 get | it |0 home | ."
You |0 just | |0 have | to |0 know | what you |1 're | |0 getting | |1 into | |0 when | you |0 go | .
"|0 Nice | |0 local | |0 pub | , |0 excellent | |0 food | ( |0 especially | |0 wings | ) , |1 and | |1 do | n't |0 go | if you |0 have | |1 a | |0 limited | |0 amount | |1 of | |0 time | ."
|0 Trust | |1 The | |0 Midas | |0 Touch |
"I |0 personally | |0 trust | |1 this | |0 Midas | |0 store | |1 with | |1 all | my |0 vehicles | , I |1 have | |1 been | |0 going | |0 there | |1 for | |0 years | |1 & | |1 would | |0 never | |0 go | |0 anywhere | |0 else | !"
|1 the | |0 staff | |1 is | |0 very | |0 personable | |1 & | |0 actually | |0 care | |1 about | |1 the | |0 customers | |0 safety | |0 rather | |1 than | |0 taking | there |0 money | .
This |1 is | |0 however | |1 a | |0 very | |0 busy | |0 shop | |1 but | there |0 are | |0 appointments | |0 available | |1 & | |1 the | |0 staff | |1 up | |0 front | |1 will | |0 surely | |0 make | |0 sure | you |0 get | |0 back | |1 in | |1 a | |0 timely | |0 manner | .
I |0 look | |1 at | |1 some | |1 of | |1 these | |0 other | |0 comments | |1 & | |0 laugh | because |0 people | |0 think | that |1 the | |0 world | |0 revolves | |1 around | them !
|1 Like | |1 the | |0 girl | |1 with | |1 the | |0 fuse | |0 problem | ...
|0 Midas | |0 has | |1 the | |0 most | |0 high | |0 tech | |0 equipment | |1 in | |0 town | |1 & | I |0 guarantee | you if they |0 told | you it |1 was | |0 electrical | |0 then | in |0 deed | it |1 s | |0 electrical | !
|0 maybe | you |1 should | |0 understand | |0 how | |1 the | |0 world | |0 works | |1 & | |0 realize | you |1 are | |0 just | |1 like | |1 any | |0 other | |0 person | |1 & | not |0 put | yourself |1 on | |1 a | |0 pedestal | .
I |1 will | |0 continue | |0 going | |1 to | |0 Dave | |1 at | |0 Midas | because he |1 is | |1 one | |1 of | |1 the | |0 most | |0 honest | |0 business | |0 owners | |1 in | |1 this | |0 town | !
|0 When | |0 having | your |0 car | |0 worked | |1 on | you |0 have | to |0 trust | |1 the | |0 mechanic | |1 & | |1 this | |0 Midas | |1 is | |0 truly | someone you |1 can | |0 trust | !
"We |0 decided | to |0 try | |1 this | |0 place | |0 last | |0 night | because we |0 noticed | that it |0 had | |1 some | |0 interesting | |0 things | |1 on | |1 the | |0 menu | |0 aside | |1 from | |1 the | |0 usual | |0 rolls | -- |0 live | |0 scallop | |0 sashimi | , |0 duck | |0 breast | |0 nigiri | |1 with | |0 foie | |0 gras | , |0 panko | |0 mussels | -- |1 but | |0 none | |1 of | these |1 were | |0 particularly | |0 great | |1 or | |0 worth | |1 the | |0 sticker | |0 price | ."
"|0 Additionally | we |0 tried | |1 the | |0 Logan | |0 Circle | |0 roll | , |0 spicy | |0 crab | |1 and | |0 tuna | |0 roll | , |1 and | |0 sweet | |0 potato | |0 tempura | |0 roll | ( $ |1 15 | , $ |1 10 | , |1 and | $ |1 3.75 | |0 respectively | ) ."
"|1 The | |0 sweet | |0 potato | |0 tempura | |0 roll | |1 was | |0 actually | |1 a | |0 great | |0 surprise | : |0 cheap | |1 and | |0 delicious | , |1 the | |0 only | |0 thing | we |0 tried | that I |1 would | |0 say | |1 was | |0 well | |0 worth | it |1 and | |1 a | |0 great | |0 value | ( |1 and | I |0 never | |0 get | |0 vegetarian | |0 rolls | ) ."
"|1 The | |0 other | |0 rolls | |1 were | n't |0 at | |0 all | |0 special | , |0 especially | |0 given | their |0 pricing | ."
|1 The | |0 bottom | |0 line | |0 is | that |1 the | |0 food | |1 is | n't |0 great | |1 and | |1 is | |0 relatively | |0 high | - |0 priced | .
"|1 The | |0 service | |1 is | |0 solicitous | , |1 the | |0 atmosphere | |1 is | |0 nice | |1 and | |0 mod | |1 except | |1 the | |1 out | - |1 of | - |0 place | |0 flat | - |0 screen | |0 TV | |0 playing | |0 football | ."
|1 But | I |1 'd | |0 go | |0 elsewhere | unless |1 the | |0 prices | |1 are | |0 cut | .
It |1 's | |0 just | not |0 worth | it .
|1 Do | n't |0 Expect | |0 Sleep | |1 or | |0 Courtesy |
I |1 was | |0 booked | |1 for | |1 2 | |0 nights | |1 at | |1 this | |0 hotel | |1 in | |0 Oct | |1 2007 | .
"|1 At | |1 3:15 | |0 am | |1 on | |0 night | |0 # | |1 2 | , |1 the | |0 fire | |0 alarm | |1 and | |0 strobe | |0 light | |0 activated | |1 in | my |0 room | ."
These |1 are | not |0 household | |0 type | |0 alarms | .
"|0 When | they |0 sound | |1 off | , it |1 is | |1 a | |0 true | |0 audio | / |0 visual | |0 experience | ."
I |0 called | |1 the | |0 front | |0 desk | |1 and | |0 got | |1 no | |0 answer | .
"After |0 checking | |1 for | |0 signs | |1 of | |0 fire | |1 or | |0 smoke | |1 and | |0 seeing | |0 none | , I |0 decided | to |0 just | |0 pack | |1 up | |1 and | |0 leave | ."
"|1 The | |0 desk | |0 agent | |0 actually | |0 argued | |1 with | me , |0 claiming | that |1 no | |0 such | |0 alarm | |1 had | |0 gone | |1 off | ( as if I |1 would | |0 make | that |1 up | ? ) ."
"He |0 finally | |0 admitted | that |0 only | |1 the | |1 4 | |0 ADA | |0 room | |0 alarms | |1 had | |0 sounded | , |0 so | |0 only | |1 4 | |0 guests | |1 were | |0 effected | ( |1 no | |0 big | |0 deal | |1 to | him ) ."
"|1 This | |0 little | |0 drip | |0 offered | |1 no | |0 apologies | |0 whatsoever | , |1 and | |0 even | |0 refused | to |0 give | me |1 the | |0 name | |1 of | |1 the | |0 manager | until I |0 pressed | him |1 for | it |1 3 | |0 times | ."
"|1 This | |0 hotel | |1 is | |0 adequate | |0 enough | , |1 but | there |0 is | |1 an | |0 obvious | |0 problem | |1 with | |1 the | |0 staff | |1 and | |0 management | ."
|1 Do | not |0 go | |0 there | if you |0 expect | to |0 sleep | |1 through | |1 the | |0 night | .
"|0 Poor | |0 Service | , |0 Lack | |1 of | |0 Passion | : |1 Do | NOT |0 go |"
"I |0 began | |0 seeing | |0 Dr. | |0 Romanick | |0 back | |1 in | |1 2000 | |1 and | |1 have | |0 seen | |1 a | |0 significant | |0 decline | |1 in | |1 the | |0 quality | |1 of | |0 care | , |0 patient | - |0 doctor | |0 communication | , |1 and | |0 just | |1 the | |0 overall | |0 level | |1 of | |0 services | ."
"|1 The | |0 poor | |0 quality | |0 starts | |1 at | |1 the | |0 receptionist | |0 desk | , |0 where | |1 the | |0 staff | |1 is | |0 very | |0 impatient | |1 and | |0 lack | |1 the | |0 efficiency | I |0 once | |0 loved | |1 about | |1 the | |0 office | ."
"It |0 took | them |0 nearly | |1 two | |0 months | to |0 complete | |1 a | |0 simple | |0 task | , |1 and | |0 countless | |0 calls | |1 from | my |0 part | |1 due | |1 to | their |0 lack | |1 of | |0 response | |1 and | |0 passion | ( not that it |1 's | |1 a | |0 requirement | |1 for | |1 the | |0 job | , |1 but | it |0 helps | to |0 at | |0 least | |0 pretend | to |1 be | |0 helpful | ) ."
"|0 Also | , I |1 was | |0 promised | to |0 have | my |0 test | |0 results | |0 emailed | |1 to | me , |1 but | it |0 never | |0 happened | , |1 and | |1 after | |1 a | |0 few | |0 attempts | to |0 get | |0 Dr. | |0 Romanick | |1 on | |1 the | |0 phone | to |0 brief | me |1 on | my |0 condition | , I |0 finally | |0 gave | |1 up | |1 and | |0 went | |1 to | |1 a | |0 different | |0 doctor | ."
"|0 Please | |1 do | not |0 go | |0 there | if it |1 's | |0 professional | , |0 friendly | , |0 diligent | |0 medical | |0 services | you |1 're | |0 looking | |1 for | ."
"|0 Save | yourself |1 the | |0 trouble | , |0 money | |1 and | |0 time | |1 and | |0 visit | |1 a | |0 more | |0 caring | |0 facility | / |0 doctor | ."
"|1 The | |0 moving | |0 company | |1 is | |0 actualy | |0 based | |1 in | |0 Brooklyn | , |1 but | |0 advertised | |0 all | |1 over | |0 NY | / |0 NJ | , |0 including | |0 Fort | |0 Lee | ."
|0 When | |1 the | |0 guys | |0 arrived | ( |1 2 | |0 hours | |0 later | than |0 agreed | ) they |0 told | that you |0 have | to |0 pay | |1 all | |1 the | |0 tolls | they |0 payed | |0 coming | |1 from | |0 Brooklyn | |1 and | |0 extra | $ |1 100 | for them to |0 drive | |0 back | |1 from | your |0 destination | .
"That |1 was | not |1 in | |0 agreement | |0 eather | , |1 but | they |0 realy | |0 demand | it ."
|1 And | |1 another | $ |1 100 | for |0 wrapping | |1 the | |0 furniture | .
|0 So | |0 totalling | $ |1 212 | |0 just | |1 for | |0 start | before |1 any | |0 work | |0 started | .
"|0 Guess | what , |1 was | not |1 in | |1 the | |0 initial | |0 agreement | |0 as | |0 well | ."
I |1 was | |0 moving | |1 out | |1 from | |1 2 | |0 bdr | |0 apartment | |1 and | it |0 took | |1 for | |1 3 | |0 strong | |0 guys | |1 6 | |0 hours | to |0 load | |1 a | |0 track | ( |1 from | |1 2 | |0 pm | - |1 8 | |0 pm | ) .
"|1 The | |0 only | |0 reason | I |1 'm | |0 giving | |1 3 | |0 stars | |0 instead | |1 of | |1 1 | |1 or | |1 2 | , I |1 should | |0 admit | , nothing |1 was | |0 broken | ."
|0 So | I |0 still | |1 can | |0 recomend | them |1 but | |0 prepare | |0 pay | |0 twice | |0 as | |0 much | as they |0 tell | you |0 initially | .
"|1 One | |0 more | |0 thing | , they |1 do | n't |0 take | |1 any | |0 credit | |0 cards | |1 or | |0 checks | ."
You |0 have | to |0 pay | |0 CASH | |0 ONLY | before they |0 start | |0 unloading | |0 track | |1 on | your |0 destination | .
|0 Worst | |0 Apartments | |0 EVER |
"We |0 lived | |0 here | |1 for | |1 2 | |0 years | , |1 the | |0 first | |0 year | |1 or | |0 so | |1 was | |0 okay | ."
"|0 Then | , |1 the | |0 more | |0 power | they |0 gave | |1 to | |0 Linda | , |1 the | |0 worse | |1 the | |0 place | |0 got | ."
"We |1 were | |0 always | |0 having | our |0 water | |0 shut | |1 off | , there |0 were | |0 always | |0 people | |0 having | |0 parties | |1 at | |1 the | |0 pool | , |0 even | after it |1 was | |0 supposed | to |1 be | |0 closed | ."
"|1 The | |0 pool | |1 was | |0 supposed | to |0 close | |1 at | |1 10 | |1 and | they |1 would | |0 have | |0 people | |0 down | |0 there | |1 until | |1 11:45 | |0 yelling | , |0 playing | |0 music | |1 and | |0 do | who - |0 knows | - what |1 in | |1 the | |0 dark | |0 corners | |1 of | |1 the | |0 pool | ."
"|0 Then | , |0 when | we |0 moved | |1 out | , we |0 cleaned | |1 the | |0 apartment | |0 top | |1 to | |0 bottom | , they |0 came | |0 back | |1 and | |0 tried | to |0 charge | us |1 for | |1 two | |0 cleaning | |0 fees | ( |1 and | we |0 never | |0 got | our |0 deposit | |0 back | ) |1 and | |0 past | |0 utilities | ( that |1 were | |0 already | |0 paid | , we |0 have | |0 check | |0 numbers | |1 and | |0 records | |1 of | this ) ."
"|0 Linda | |1 is | |1 the | |0 rudest | |0 person | you |1 will | |0 ever | |0 talk | |1 to | |1 and | she |0 sticks | |1 up | |1 for | |1 all | |1 of | |1 the | |0 trashy | , |0 rude | |0 people | that |0 live | |0 there | , |0 not | |1 the | |0 nice | |0 ones | that |0 actually | |0 give | |1 a | |0 crap | about |0 respecting | |0 others | ."

|1 The | |0 Worst | |0 Experience | |0 Ever | !!!
"I |1 have | |0 worked | |1 with | |0 Ted | |0 Jurek | |1 at | |0 Decor | |1 and | |0 You | , |1 and | it |0 started | |1 out | |1 as | |1 a | |0 decent | |0 experience | ."

I |0 figure | I |1 would | |0 give | |1 this | |0 company | |1 a | |0 chance | .
"|0 However | , after |0 giving | |1 a | |0 required | $ |1 500.00 | ( NON |0 REFUNDABLE | ) |0 deposit | before |0 seeing | |1 any | |0 plans | |1 or | |0 ideas | , I |1 was | |0 sorry | I |1 did | ."
"We |0 met | |1 a | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 weeks | |0 later | , |0 Ted | |1 was | |0 late | ."
"He |0 brought | |0 fabric | |0 books | , |1 and | |0 pictures | |1 of | |0 furniture | |0 only | , which |1 all | |0 came | |0 way | |1 over | |0 budget | ."
"|1 By | |1 the | |0 time | we |0 got | |1 to | |1 the | |0 budget | i |0 told | him I |1 could | |0 work | |1 with | , there |0 was | |0 basically | |1 no | |0 design | ."
|0 Just | |0 curtains | |1 and | |1 a | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 accessories | .
WHAT |1 IS | THAT ?????
|1 This | |0 company | |1 is | |0 way | |0 too | |0 expensive | |1 with | nothing to |0 show | |1 for | it .

"|1 After | |1 a | |0 good | |0 few | |0 minutes | , he |0 asked | : "" what |1 do | you |0 want | ? """
|0 Somewhere | |1 in | |1 between | his |0 rudeness | he |0 asked | if we |0 smoked | .
I |0 asked | if |1 this | |0 hotel | |0 had | |0 smoking | |0 rooms | .
"He |0 immediately | |0 said | "" |0 no | , there |0 is | |1 a | $ |1 50 | |0 deposit | |0 now | ! """
|0 Sure | |0 enough | he |0 charged | it |1 to | |1 the | |0 credit | |0 card | .
"|0 When | I |0 inquired | he |0 rudely | |0 replied | "" |1 in | |1 the | |0 morning | |0 when | |0 things | |1 are | |0 checked | |1 out | you |1 'll | |0 get | it |0 back | . """
I |0 called | |0 customer | |0 service | |1 about | it because |1 the | |0 website | |0 specifically | |0 states | that there |0 are | |1 no | |0 other | |0 charges | |1 at | |1 the | |0 check | - |0 in | .
I |0 also | |0 mentioned | |1 to | |1 the | |0 reception | |0 person | .
"He |0 responded | "" we |0 have | |0 problem | |1 with | ' |0 people | ' "" ."
|0 Imagine | |1 a | |0 hotel | |0 having | |0 problems | |1 with | |0 people | .
I |0 finally | |0 alerted | him |1 to | his |0 rudeness | .
He |0 said | he |1 's | |0 had | |1 a | |0 long | |1 and | |0 bad | |0 day | .
We |0 had | |1 no | |0 choice | but to |0 stay | |1 but | |1 will | |0 take | this |0 as | |0 far | as we |1 can | .
|1 Do | n't |0 stay | |0 there | .
I |0 came | to |0 find | |1 out | |1 the | |0 person | |1 was | |1 the | |0 hotel | |0 OWNER | |0 also | .
"My |0 friend | |1 and | I |0 were | to |0 stay | |0 here | |1 for | |1 a | |0 girls | |0 night | , |0 catch | |1 up | |1 on | our |0 lives | |0 evening | ."
We |0 live | |1 within | |1 20 | |0 miles | |1 of | |1 the | |0 hotel | |1 and | |0 wanted | to |0 get | |0 away | |1 from | our |0 responsibilities | |1 for | |1 the | |0 night | .
|0 Unfortunalty | my |0 husband | |1 and | I |0 had | to |0 put | our |1 13 | |0 year | |0 old | |0 lab | |1 down | |1 that | |0 morning | |1 and | we |1 were | not |0 expecting | this .
My |0 friend | |0 called | |1 the | |0 hotel | to |0 cancel | our |0 room | |0 as | |0 soon | as I |0 called | her .
They |0 said | that we |0 were | to |1 be | |0 charged | |1 for | |1 this | |0 room | |0 regardless | because we |1 did | not |0 cancel | |1 within | |1 the | |1 72 | |0 hours | .
I |0 called | them |0 back | |1 a | |0 few | |0 hours | after |0 putting | my |0 Bodhi | |1 down | |1 and | they |0 still | |1 would | n't |0 budge | .
"|0 Times | |1 are | |0 hard | , I |0 know | , |1 but | they |0 had | |1 no | |0 compassion | ."
"I |0 called | |1 3 | |0 times | to |0 talked | |1 to | |1 a | |0 manager | , |0 never | |1 a | |0 call | |0 back | ."
"I |0 emailed | |1 4 | |0 times | , |0 never | |1 a | |0 response | ."
"|1 In | |1 one | |1 of | |1 the | |0 emails | I |0 attached | |1 the | |0 letter | |1 from | |1 the | |0 Vet | 's that |0 expressed | their |0 sympathy | , |1 this | |0 hotel | |0 did | nothing ."
I |0 even | |0 emailed | |0 Mackinaw | |0 Tourist | |1 and | nothing .
"I |1 am | |0 sure | this |1 is | |1 a | |0 good | |0 place | to |0 stay | from |0 reading | |1 the | |0 other | |0 reviews | , |1 but | if something |0 unexpected | |0 happens | |1 in | your |0 life | , they |1 will | not |0 care | ."

"|0 Ok | I |1 am | |1 a | |0 New | |0 Yorker | who |1 has | |1 been | |0 going | |1 to | |0 school | |1 in | |0 Oxford | , |0 England | ."
I |0 thought | |1 the | |0 UK | |1 was | |0 completely | |0 devoid | |1 of | |0 good | |0 NYC | |0 style | |0 pizza | .
"I |0 thought | to |0 get | |1 a | |0 decent | |0 pizza | |1 the | |0 only | |0 way | |1 was | |1 at | |1 a | |0 fancy | |0 restaurant | , |1 and | I |0 have | to |0 get | |1 a | |0 whole | |0 pie | ."
I |0 thought | I |1 would | |0 have | to |0 wait | until I |0 went | |0 home | |1 to | |0 NYC | .
|0 Well | |0 then | I |0 went | |1 on | |1 a | |0 trip | |1 to | |0 Glasgow | |1 and | |1 was | |0 walking | |0 around | .
I |0 saw | |1 this | |0 place | |1 and | it |0 looked | |1 like | |1 the | |0 HOLY | |0 GRAIL | .
"I |0 knew | I |1 had | |0 found | |1 the | |0 real | |0 deal | , |0 big | |0 pies | , |0 sold | |1 by | |1 the | |0 slice | , with |1 the | |0 pizzas | |0 sitting | |1 under | |1 the | |0 glass | |1 in | |1 the | |0 front | ."
They |0 have | |0 crushed | |0 red | |0 pepper | |0 flakes | |1 and | |0 oregano | .
|0 So | I |0 ordered | |1 a | |0 slice | .
It |0 tasted | like I |0 just | |0 flew | |0 back | |0 home | .
"I |1 du | n |0 no | |0 how | they |0 did | it , |1 but | |0 Scottish | |0 friends | --- this |1 is | |1 THE | |0 REAL | |0 DEAL | ."
I |0 congratulated | |1 this | |0 establishment | for |0 doing | |1 the | |0 research | on |0 making | |0 NYC | |0 pizza | because |1 these | |0 Scots | |0 fcking | |0 nailed | it .
"That |1 being | |0 said | , I |1 do | n't |0 know | |0 how | their |0 delivery | |0 service | |1 is | ."
"They |1 might | |0 want | to |0 change | |1 the | |0 name | to |0 reflect | |1 the | |0 new | |0 yorkedness | |1 of | |1 the | |0 pizza | , |0 scrummy | |0 yummy | |0 sounds | |0 gimmicky | |1 to | me ."
"|0 Good | |0 food | , |0 good | |0 wait | |0 staff | , |0 poor | |0 management |"
We |0 visited | |1 on | |1 7/26/08 | |1 for | |0 dinner | We |0 received | |1 a | |0 gift | |0 certificate | |1 for | |1 the | |0 Mama | |0 Mia | 's |1 on | |0 Greenfield | |0 Ave | .
"|1 The | |0 food | |1 was | |0 good | , |1 and | |0 so | |1 was | our |0 waitress | ."
"|0 When | it |0 came | |0 time | to |0 pay | |1 the | |0 bill | |0 up | |0 front | , they |1 would | not |0 let | me |0 use | |1 any | |1 of | |1 the | |0 certificate | |1 for | |1 a | |0 tip | ( which I |1 have | |0 done | |1 with | |1 any | |0 other | |0 restaurant | I |1 've | |0 gotten | |1 a | |0 gift | |0 certificate | |1 for | . )"
I |0 then | |0 asked | if I |1 could | |0 have | |0 money | |0 back | |1 in | |0 cash | .
"|1 The | |0 person | |0 went | to |0 go | |0 check | |1 with | |1 the | |0 manager | , who |1 was | |0 sitting | |1 at | |1 a | |0 table | |0 chatting | |1 with | her |0 friends | who |1 were | |0 eating | |0 there | ."
Her |0 answer | |1 was | |0 short | |1 and | |0 manner | |0 rather | |0 rude | .
|0 Sorry | for |0 interrupting | I |0 guess | .
"|1 The | |0 cashier | |1 was | |0 also | |0 short | , |0 unapologetic | |1 and | |0 made | me |0 feel | as I |1 was | |0 wasting | her |0 time | ."
There |0 were | |1 no | |0 other | |0 options | |0 available | ( I |0 only | |0 brought | my |0 check | |0 card | to |0 cover | |1 any | |0 overage | |0 cost | ) |1 and | she |0 rang | it |1 up | |1 and | |0 applied | it |1 to | |1 the | |0 gift | |0 card | before |0 telling | me |1 about | |1 the | |0 tip | |0 policy | .
I |1 will | not |1 be | |0 visiting | |0 Mama | |0 Mia | 's |0 again | .

|0 Identity | |0 Theft |
Myself |1 and | my |0 fiance | 's |0 identity | |1 was | |0 stolen | |1 from | |1 the | |0 office | |0 staff | .
We |1 were | |0 told | |1 by | |1 a | |0 detective | |1 and | |0 asked | to |0 check | our |0 credit | |1 for | anything |0 unusual | .
|0 Luckily | they |0 caught | |1 the | |0 crooks | before they |0 did | |1 one | |1 on | us .
It |1 was | |1 a | |0 black | |0 female | that |0 use | to |0 work | |1 in | |1 the | |0 office | .
She |0 stole | |1 the | |0 information | |1 and | |0 gave | it |1 to | |1 another | |0 guy | that |0 did | |1 all | |1 the | |0 work | .
|1 The | |0 other | |0 guy | |1 was | |0 pulled | |0 over | |1 one | |0 day | |1 and | |1 a | |0 cop | |0 saw | |0 suspicious | |0 papers | |1 with | |0 names | |1 and | |0 social | |0 security | |0 numbers | |1 on | it .
That |0 s | |0 how | they |1 were | |0 caught | .
They |1 both | |0 went | |1 to | |0 jail | |1 and | |1 a | |0 new | |0 manager | |1 was | |0 put | |1 in | |0 charge | |1 of | |1 the | |0 apartments | .
|1 The | |0 apartment | |1 across | |1 from | mine |0 belonged | |1 to | |1 a | |0 gang | |1 of | |0 hookers | .
Nobody |0 lived | |0 there | .
"|1 A | |0 girl | |1 would | |0 show | |1 up | , |0 then | |1 a | |0 guy | |1 in | |1 a | |0 nice | |0 car | |1 would | |0 show | |1 up | ."
"|0 Short | |0 time | |0 later | |1 the | |0 guy | |1 would | |0 leave | , |0 then | |1 the | |0 girl | |0 leave | ."
My |0 apartment | |1 was | |0 usually | |0 quiet | .
I |0 lived | |1 in | |1 one | that |1 did | not |0 face | |1 the | |0 parking | |0 lot | .
|0 Parking | |0 spaces | |1 are | |0 just | |0 big | |0 enough | |1 for | |1 a | |0 Mini | |0 Cooper | .
It |0 sucked | |0 having | |1 an | |0 SUV | .
"If I |0 found | |1 a | |0 spot | , I |1 could | nt |0 fit | |1 in | it ."
|0 Gates | |0 worked | |1 30 | % |1 of | |1 the | |0 time | |0 at | |0 best | .
"|0 Bugs | |1 were | |1 a | |0 small | |0 problem | , nothing |0 too | |0 bad | ."
|1 The | |0 best | there |0 is | |1 in | |0 service | .
I |1 was | |0 recently | |0 traveling | |1 down | |0 I | - |0 24 | |1 from | |0 Nashville | |1 with | my |1 3 | |0 young | |0 children | |1 and | |0 had | |1 a | |0 blowout | |1 on | |1 the | |0 southeast | |0 side | |1 of | |0 Murfreesboro | .
"It |1 was | |1 4:50 | |0 when | |1 a | |0 friend | |0 told | me to |0 call | |0 Bud | , he |1 would | |0 take | |0 care | |1 of | me ."
"|0 Not | |0 only | |1 did | they |0 answer | |1 the | |0 phone | |1 at | |1 4:50 | |1 on | |1 a | |0 Thursday | , they |0 hit | |1 the | |0 ground | |0 moving | !."
"They |0 tracked | |1 down | |1 the | |0 only | |0 tire | that |0 fit | my |0 BMW | |0 330i | |1 in | |0 Murfreesboro | |1 within | |0 minutes | |1 and | |0 secured | it , |0 then | they |0 came | |0 out | , |0 took | |1 off | my |0 tire | ( it |1 was | |1 a | |0 runflat | - |1 but | |0 runflats | |1 do | n't |0 do | you |1 any | |0 good | if they |0 blow | |1 out | ) , |1 and | |0 brought | it |1 to | their |0 shop | to |0 change | |1 the | |0 tire | ."
They |1 were | |0 back | |0 quickly | |0 considering | |0 how | |0 far | |1 outside | |1 of | |0 Murfreesboro | we |1 were | |1 and | |0 had | us |1 on | our |0 way | |1 by | |1 6:30 | |1 that | |0 evening | .
|0 Thanks | |0 Bud | |1 for | |1 all | |1 of | your |0 help | |1 and | |0 taking | |0 time | |0 away | |1 from | your |0 family | |1 that | |0 evening | .
"It |1 's | |1 without | |1 a | |0 doubt | , |1 the | |0 best | |0 service | |0 experience | I |1 've | |0 ever | |0 had | |1 and | |0 just | to |1 be | |0 clear | , |1 the | |0 price | he |0 charged | me |1 was | |1 the | |0 same | |1 as | my |0 tire | |0 guy | |1 in | |0 Nashville | 's |0 price | for |0 putting | |1 on | |1 the | |0 other | |0 rear | |0 tire | ."

I |1 was | |0 told | |0 management | |1 would | |0 call | me |1 back | |1 but | |0 still | |0 waiting | |1 for | |1 that | |0 call | .
"I |1 will | |0 probably | |0 stay | |0 here | |0 again | because it |1 s | |0 cheap | |1 and | I |1 ca | nt |0 afford | |1 a | |0 better | |0 hotel | , |1 but | |1 do | not |0 look | |0 forward | |1 to | it |1 and | |1 would | |0 definitely | not |0 recommend | |1 this | |0 hotel | |1 for | |0 families | |1 or | |0 single | |0 female | |0 travellers | ."
|1 Was | |0 there | |1 this | |0 past | |0 weekend | |1 and | |1 the | |0 guy | |1 behind | |1 the | |0 counter | |0 yelled | |1 at | me |1 and | my |0 son | because we |0 believed | he |0 left | |1 the | |0 grandma | |0 slice | |1 in | |1 the | |0 oven | |1 a | |0 little | |0 too | |0 long | |1 and | |1 the | |0 cheese | |1 got | |0 all | |0 dried | |1 out | |1 and | |1 the | |0 slice | |0 tasted | |0 more | |1 like | |1 a | |0 cracker | .
"He |0 preceded | to |0 grab | |1 the | |0 slice | |1 off | |1 the | |0 countertop | |1 and | |0 throw | it |1 into | |1 the | |0 trash | while |0 yelling | |1 at | me |0 saying | , "" you |1 do | not |0 order | what you |1 do | not |0 know | |1 about | "" |1 and | "" you |1 do | n't |0 know | |0 how | |0 pizza | |1 is | |0 made | "" ."

"|1 A | |0 restaurant | |1 with | |1 this | |0 many | |0 patrons | |0 willing | to |0 stand | |1 in | |0 line | |0 just | to |0 order | |0 tacos | |1 must | |1 be | |0 good | , |0 right | ?"
"I |0 mean | , that |1 's | |1 the | |0 way | it |0 works | |1 at | |0 amusement | |0 parks | : |1 the | |0 longest | |0 lines | |1 are | |1 at | |1 the | |0 best | |0 rides | ."

|1 Unlike | |0 Saratoga | .
I |0 rrly | |0 seek | |1 the | |0 cehf | |1 out | to |0 introduce | myself -- |1 but | |1 the | |0 second | |0 time | we |0 went | -- i |0 made | |1 a | |0 point | of |0 asking | our |0 wait | |0 person | to |0 introduce | my |0 friend | |1 and | myself |1 to | |1 the | |0 chef | to |0 tell | him |0 just | |0 how | |0 good | our |0 meals | |1 were | .
|1 Can | not |0 wait | to |0 go | |0 gain | .

"|0 First | |1 of | |1 all | , if you |0 call | |1 for | |1 an | |0 appointment | they |1 wo | n't |0 tell | you to |0 call | |0 back | |1 a | |0 month | |0 later | so you |1 can | |0 then | |0 make | |1 one | ."

I |0 feel | that |1 the | |0 way | |1 some | |0 doctor | s |0 offices | |0 work | |1 around | |0 here | |1 is | |1 a | |0 little | |0 bit | |0 absurd | |0 so | I |1 'm | |0 happy | that |1 these | |0 guys | |1 do | n't |0 do | |1 those | |1 two | |0 things | |1 in | |0 particlular | .
|0 Usually | you |1 can | |1 be | |0 seen | |1 the | |0 same | |0 week | |1 or | |0 maybe | |1 the | |0 following | |0 week | .
|1 The | |0 doctor | |1 did | |0 tell | me that my |0 male | |0 pattern | |0 baldness | |1 is | |1 due | |1 to | my |0 mother | s |0 father | because |1 the | |0 gene | |1 is | |0 exclusively | |0 passed | |1 on | |1 through | |0 maternal | |0 line | |1 but | that |1 's | |1 a | |0 common | |0 misconception | ( http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm ) .
|1 In | |0 general | I |1 would | |0 say | that |1 the | |0 staff | |1 is | |0 attentive | |1 and | |0 nice | .

|0 First | |0 trip | |1 to | |0 Canada |
I |0 recently | |0 traveled | |1 to | |0 Canada | |1 on | |0 business | |1 and | |0 had | |1 a | |0 most | |0 excellent | |0 experience | .
I |0 work | |1 for | |1 a | |0 large | |0 retail | |0 company | |0 recently | |0 expanding | our |0 operations | |1 into | |0 Canada | |1 and | |0 had | to |0 travel | to |0 ensure | |1 all | |1 of | our |0 computer | |0 network | |0 equipment | |1 was | |0 installed | |0 properly | |1 and | |1 on | |0 time | .
This |1 can | |0 tend | to |1 be | |1 a | |0 stressful | |0 experience | |1 in | itself |0 let | |0 alone | |0 adding | |0 crossing | |0 boarders | |1 for | |1 the | |0 first | |0 time | .
I |1 was | |0 very | |0 pleased | to |0 find | my |0 accommodations | |1 and | |1 the | |0 hotel | |0 staff | to |1 be | |1 a | |0 very | |0 calming | |1 and | |0 comforting | |0 part | |1 of | my |0 trip | .
"I |0 found | |1 the | |0 hotel | to |1 be | |0 amazingly | |0 clean | , |0 not | to |0 mention | |0 very | |0 well | |0 adorned | |1 with | |0 many | |0 pleasant | |0 surprises | ."
|1 From | my |0 first | |0 encounter | |1 at | |0 check | |0 in | |1 to | my |0 regrettable | |0 check | |0 out | I |0 found | |1 the | |0 staff | |1 and | |0 facility | to |0 exceed | my |0 expectation | .

I |1 will | |1 be | |0 traveling | |1 in | |1 this | |0 area | |1 in | |1 the | |0 future | |1 and | you |1 can | |1 be | |0 assured | that |1 this | |0 experience | |1 will | |1 be | |0 helpful | |1 in | my |0 choice | |1 of | |0 hotels | |1 and | |0 Novotel | |1 will | |1 be | my |0 first | |0 selection | .
|0 Yes | |1 the | |0 parking | |1 can | |1 be | |1 a | |0 challenge | |1 but | |1 being | |1 from | |0 NJ | I |1 am | |1 no | |0 stranger | |1 to | |0 tight | |0 corners | .
|0 Please | |0 pass | my |0 appreciation | |1 to | |1 the | |0 Staff | |1 and | |0 Management | |1 for | their |0 excellent | |0 hospitality | |1 and | |0 good | |0 spirits | as it |0 helped | |0 make | |1 a | |0 stressful | |0 trip | |0 enjoyable | .
|0 Favorite | |0 place | |1 in | |0 Tampa | .
|0 Update | : I |0 had | to |0 add | |1 to | my |0 review | .
I |1 was | |0 just | |0 in | |0 last | |0 night | |1 and | |0 had | |1 a | |0 chance | to |0 dine | |1 in | their |0 new | |0 dining | |0 room | .
|0 AMAZING | !
I |0 frequent | |1 this | |0 resturant | |1 on | |1 a | |0 weekly | |0 basis | |1 but | |0 usally | |0 only | |1 for | |0 lunch | .
"|0 Well | I |1 was | |1 in | |1 for | |1 a | |0 treat | |0 when | I |1 was | |0 greeted | |1 by | |1 the | |0 friendly | |0 girls | |1 at | |1 the | |0 counter | who |0 asked | if my |0 wife | |1 and | I |1 would | |0 like | to |0 sit | |1 in | their "" |0 new | "" |0 dining | |0 room | ."
|0 Right | |0 away | they |0 told | us that it |1 was | |1 the | |0 same | |0 great | |0 food | |1 with | |1 the | |0 same | |0 prices | |0 so | |0 off | we |0 went | .
We |1 were | |0 greeted | |0 again | |1 and | |0 sat | |0 promptly | .
"After |0 looking | |1 at | |1 the | |0 menu | |1 and | |0 seeing | |1 the | |0 new | |0 menu | |0 items | they |0 had | , we |0 knew | we |1 were | |1 in | |1 for | |1 a | |0 treat | !"
I |0 had | |1 the | |0 Chicken | |0 Parmesan | |0 Dinner | |1 and | my |0 wife | |0 had | |1 the | |0 Shrimp | |0 Scampi | |0 Dinner | .
|0 AMAZING | !
|1 The | |0 portions | |1 were | |0 generous | |0 enough | that we |0 even | |0 took | |1 some | |0 home | !
I |0 have | to |0 say | |1 the | |0 value | |1 of | |1 this | |0 place | |0 always | |0 amazes | me .
"It |1 's | |0 nice | to |0 see | that |0 even | |1 in | |1 the | |0 economy | we |1 can | |0 eat | |1 a | |0 place | that |0 has | |0 upscale | |0 service | , |0 amazing | |0 atmosphere | , |1 and | |0 Incredible | |0 food | , |1 but | not |0 break | |1 the | |0 bank | while |0 enjoying | it !"
|0 Bottom | |0 line | |0 is | that |0 when | it |1 's | |1 a | |0 small | |0 privatly | |0 owned | |0 resturant | like this |0 is | you |1 can | |0 tell | that |1 the | |0 owners | |1 and | |0 employees | |0 take | |0 pride | |1 in | their |0 product | |1 and | |0 service | .
|0 Well | |0 Done | !
|0 Great | |0 work | |1 and | |0 honest | |0 establishment | !
"I |0 typically | |0 have | |0 work | |0 done | |1 on | my |0 Jeep | |1 at | |1 the | |0 dealership | , |1 but | it |1 is | |1 6 | |0 years | |0 old | |0 now | |1 and | |1 getting | |0 charged | |0 dealership | |0 prices | |0 just | |1 did | n't |0 seem | |0 cost | |0 effective | |0 anymore | ."
I |1 had | |0 tried | |1 out | |0 few | |0 place | |1 around | |1 the | |0 area | |1 and | |1 had | |1 been | |0 ripped | |1 off | |1 a | |0 few | |0 times | .
I |1 had | |0 hear | |0 great | |0 things | |1 about | |0 Phet | |1 and | |0 G&G | |0 Automotive | |0 so | I |0 decided | to |0 give | him |1 a | |0 try | .
|1 The | |0 service | |1 was | |0 excellent | |1 and | |0 personable | .
He |0 checked | |1 out | what I |0 needed | to |0 have | |0 done | |0 told | me what |0 needed | |1 be | |0 fixed | before he |0 did | |1 any | |0 work | |1 and | |0 did | |0 great | |0 repair | |0 work | .
"|1 The | |0 price | |1 was | |0 actually | |0 lower | than what I |1 had | |0 anticipated | |1 and | |0 used | |1 to | |0 compared | |1 to | |0 other | |0 places | , |1 plus | he |0 showed | me |1 the | |0 work | he |0 did | |0 when | I |0 came | |0 in | to |0 pick | |1 up | |1 the | |0 car | ."
"|0 Also | , |1 a | |0 week | |1 after | |1 the | |0 work | , |0 Phet | |0 called | me |1 up | to |0 see | |0 how | my |0 car | |1 was | |0 running | |1 and | to |0 let | me |0 know | that they |1 had | |0 accidentally | |0 overcharged | me |1 for | |0 part | |1 of | |1 the | |0 work | |1 and | |0 wanted | to |0 give | me |1 a | |0 refund | |1 for | |1 that | |0 amount | ."
That |1 is | |0 just | |0 unheard | |0 of | |1 these | |0 days | !
"I |0 grew | |1 up | |1 in | |1 a | |0 small | |0 town | |0 where | you |0 knew | |1 and | |0 trusted | your |0 mechanic | |1 and | |1 was | |0 really | |0 cynical | |1 about | |0 city | |0 auto | |0 repair | |0 shops | since I |0 moved | |0 here | , |1 but | |0 Phet | |1 has | |0 shown | that there |0 really | |0 are | |0 honest | |0 hard | |0 working | |0 mechanics | |0 around | ."
He |1 is | my |0 mechanic | |0 going | |0 forward | !
"Our |0 company | |1 is | |1 a | |0 high | |0 end | |0 designer | |0 handbag | |1 and | |0 fashion | |0 accessories | |0 company | , |0 thus | we |1 are | |0 certainly | |1 a | |0 niche | |0 market | ."
"We |1 had | |1 been | |0 evaluating | |0 SEO | |0 providers | |1 for | |1 quite | |1 some | |0 time | |1 and | |0 finally | |0 decided | to |0 take | |1 the | |0 plunge | |1 with | |0 Stuart | , |1 and | |0 Ulistic | ."
We |0 made | |1 the | |0 decision | |1 for | |1 a | |0 couple | |1 of | |0 reasons | .
1 . |0 Social | |0 Media | .
"We |1 were | |0 familiar | |1 with | |0 Search | |0 Engine | |0 Optimization | |0 strategies | , |1 but | |0 new | nothing |1 about | |0 Social | |0 Media | - we |0 just | |0 heard | that it |1 was | |1 the | |0 next | |0 big | |0 thing | ."
2 . We |0 really | |0 liked | |1 the | |0 fact | that |0 Stuart | |0 sets | |0 defined | |0 objectives | |1 and | we |0 meet | |0 once | |1 a | |0 month | to |0 go | |1 over | our |0 Key | |0 Performance | |0 Indicators | .
|0 How | |1 has | it |0 gone | |0 so | |0 far | ?
"|0 Well | we |1 have | |1 been | |0 working | |1 with | |0 Ulistic | |1 for | |1 1.5 | |0 months | , |1 and | |0 have | |1 100 | |0 people | |0 following | our |0 site | |1 on | |0 Facebook | , |1 and | our |0 web | |0 site | , www.designofashion.com |1 has | |0 seen | |1 a | |1 3 | |0 fold | |0 increase | |1 in | |0 traffic | , which |1 is | |0 significantly | |0 beating | our |0 expectations | - |0 SEO | |1 is | |1 a | |0 process | that |0 takes | |0 time | |1 and | to |0 get | |0 results | |0 this | |0 quickly | |1 is | |0 exceptional | ."
"We |1 are | |0 absolutely | |0 confident | that |0 Stuart | 's |0 ethical | |1 and | |0 focused | |0 strategies | |1 will | |0 see | |1 these | |0 trends | |0 continue | to |0 grow | , |1 and | our |0 business | |1 will | |0 reap | |1 the | |0 rewards | |1 of | |1 this | |0 program | ."
"|0 Finally | , it |1 must | |1 be | |0 said | that |0 Stuart | |1 is | |1 a | |0 fantastic | |0 person | to |0 work | |1 with | , |1 because | |1 of | his |0 solid | |0 strategies | |1 and | |0 equally | |1 as | |0 importantly | because he |1 is | |1 a | |0 genuinely | |0 good | |0 person | |1 and | |1 a | |0 great | |0 communicator | ."
|0 Excellent | |0 service | |1 and | |0 quality |
I |0 had | |0 Hom | - |0 Excel | |0 replace | |0 most | |1 of | |1 the | |0 windows | |1 in | my |0 Tampa | |0 residence | |1 three | |0 years | |0 ago | .
"|1 The | |0 excellent | |0 windows | |1 have | |0 performed | |1 without | |1 any | |0 problems | , |1 but | that |1 's | not |0 why | I |1 'm | |0 writing | my |0 review | ."
"|1 Three | |0 weeks | |0 ago | , |0 burglars | |0 tried | to |0 gain | |0 entry | |1 into | |1 the | |0 rear | |1 of | my |0 home | ."
|1 The | |0 intruders | |0 slit | |1 the | |0 screen | |1 of | |1 the | |0 window | .
"|0 Next | , they |0 tried | to |0 force | |1 the | |0 window | |1 with | |1 a | |0 pry | |0 bar | |1 and | |0 then | to |0 break | |1 the | |0 window | |1 with | |1 a | |0 hammer | ."
|1 The | |0 window | |1 did | n't |0 break | !
"My |0 next | - |0 door | |0 neighbor | |0 heard | |1 the | |0 noise | |1 and | |0 turned | |1 on | |1 a | |0 light | , |0 thankfully | |0 scaring | |1 the | |1 two | |0 miscreants | |0 away | ( they |0 even | |0 left | their |0 hammer | |0 behind | ! ) ."
"I |0 called | |0 Home | - |0 Excel | |1 the | |0 next | |0 day | to |0 order | |1 a | |0 replacement | |0 screen | |1 for | |1 the | |0 window | , |1 and | |1 was | |0 happily | |0 surprised | |0 when | they |0 said | that they |1 were | n't |0 even | |0 going | to |0 charge | me |1 for | |1 the | |0 replacement | |0 screen | ... that it |1 would | |1 be | |0 covered | |1 under | their |0 guarentee | ."
"|0 Lo | |1 and | |0 behold | , they |0 replaced | |1 the | |0 screen | ( which |0 had | to |1 be | |0 ordered | ) |0 yesterday | |1 and | |1 did | n't |0 charge | me |1 a | |0 dime | ."
Their |0 worker | |0 even | |0 cleaned | |1 3 | |1 of | my |0 windows | |1 and | |0 changed | |1 a | |0 lightbulb | |1 for | me .
"|1 In | |1 this | |0 day | |1 and | |0 age | , it |1 is | |0 so | |0 rare | to |0 find | |1 a | |0 company | |1 with | |0 such | |0 nice | |0 workers | |1 and | |0 such | |0 far | |0 ranging | |0 guarantee | |0 policies | ."
"I |0 rarely | |0 write | |0 reviews | |0 such | |1 as | |1 this | |0 one | , |1 but | they |0 certainly | |0 deserve | anyone 's |0 business | !"
"|0 Friendly | |0 staff | , |1 but | |0 definitely | |1 some | |0 problems |"
"|0 May | , |1 2009 | ."
We |1 were | |0 booked | |1 at | |1 the | |0 Sheraton | |1 with | |1 a | |0 number | |1 of | |0 other | |1 out | - |1 of | - |0 town | |0 wedding | |0 guests | .
"|1 Got | |0 put | |1 into | |1 the | |0 wrong | |0 room | |1 the | |0 first | |0 night | , |1 and | |1 were | |0 quite | |0 surprised | to |0 have | someone |1 with | |1 the | |0 same | |0 room | |0 key | |0 trying | to |0 get | |1 in | |1 the | |0 door | |1 at | |1 1:00 | |0 am | !"

|1 In | |1 the | |0 second | |0 room | it |0 took | |1 3 | |0 tries | to |0 get | |1 all | |1 the | |0 towels | |1 and | |0 linens | we |0 requested | .

"|0 Essentially | , I |0 told | him I |1 did | n't |0 trust | him cause he |1 was | |1 a | |0 car | |0 salesman | , |1 but | he |0 got | |0 so | |0 incredibly | |0 offended | |1 at | |1 that | |0 statement | that he |0 had | to |0 go | |0 cry | |1 to | |1 another | |0 salesman | |1 and | |0 compose | himself before |0 coming | |0 back | ."
"I |1 do | n't |0 know | if |1 the | |0 kid | |0 had | |1 a | |0 bad | |0 day | |1 or | what , |1 but | I |0 had | to |0 sit | |1 and | |0 apologize | |1 about | nothing |1 for | |1 10 | |0 minutes | until he |0 dropped | |1 the | |0 issue | ."
"|1 After | that , I |0 just | |0 tried | to |0 ignore | his |0 lack | |1 of | |0 professionalism | |1 and | |0 test | |0 drive | |1 the | |0 car | ."
I |0 played | |0 dumb | |1 and | |0 asked | him |0 questions | that I |0 already | |0 knew | |1 the | |0 answers | |1 to | |1 and | he |0 responded | |1 with | |0 half | |0 truths | |1 and | |1 a | |0 few | |0 falsehoods | .
"|1 For | |0 instance | I |0 asked | who |0 owned | |0 Mazda | |1 and | he |0 said | |1 with | |0 confidence | that |1 was | |0 GM | , which |1 is | n't |0 true | ."
"I |0 mean | , I |1 do | n't |0 care | if he |1 does | n't |0 know | , |1 but | if he |0 pretends | to |0 know | |1 and | |0 tells | me |0 BS | |1 to | my |0 face | , there |0 's | |1 no | |0 way | I |1 'm | |0 going | to |0 trust | him |0 when | |0 matters | |0 turn | |1 to | |1 the | |0 price | |1 of | |1 the | |0 car | |1 and | |0 financing | ."
|1 The | |0 Worst | |0 Chinese | I |1 've | |0 Ever | |0 Had |
This |1 is | |1 by | |0 far | |1 the | |0 worst | |0 chinese | |0 food | I |1 have | |0 ever | |0 had | .
|1 The | |0 service | |0 stunk | .
"I |0 called | |1 in | my |0 order | |1 and | upon |0 arriving | to |0 pick | it |1 up | , they |0 got | my |0 order | |0 confused | |1 with | someone |0 else | s ."
They |0 helped | |0 about | |1 three | |0 other | |0 people | before they |0 offered | to |0 help | me |0 again | .
They |0 also | |0 got | my |0 friend | s |0 order | |0 mixed | |1 up | |1 and | |0 wanted | to |0 charger | her $ |1 10 | |0 more | than what she |1 had | |0 wanted | .
She |0 asked | |1 for | |1 the | |0 dinner | |0 combo | |1 and | they |0 gave | her |1 two | |0 dinner | |0 plates | |0 instead | .
We |1 were | |0 standing | |1 in | |1 the | |0 store | |1 for | |1 20 | |0 minutes | to |0 simply | |0 pick | |1 up | |1 an | |0 order | .
|0 Not | to |0 mention | that |1 the | |0 wait | |0 staff | |1 was | |0 about | |0 as | |0 pleasant | as |0 dealing | |1 with | |1 an | |0 angry | |0 bull | .
They |1 were | |0 abrasive | |1 and | |0 rude | - |0 when | they |1 were | |1 the | |0 ones | who |0 messed | everything |1 up | .
We |0 had | to |0 throw | |1 out | |0 about | |1 80 | |0 percent | |1 of | our |0 meals | because |1 the | |0 food | |0 tasted | |0 so | |0 horrible | .
"I |1 do | nt |0 know | |0 how | it |1 is | |0 possible | to |0 make | |0 orange | |0 chicken | , |0 sesame | |0 chicken | |1 and | |0 kung | |0 pao | |0 chicken | |0 as | |0 well | |1 as | |0 cheese | |0 puffs | |0 taste | |0 THAT | |0 bad | |1 but | |0 China | |0 Delight | |0 accomplished | that ."
|1 The | |0 only | |0 thing | that |1 was | |0 edible | |1 was | |1 the | |0 steamed | |0 rice | |1 and | |1 the | |0 vegetable | |0 lo | |0 mein | |1 was | |0 barely | |0 tolerable | .
I |1 will | |0 NEVER | |0 go | |0 here | |0 again | .
|0 Lucky | |0 Panda | |1 in | |0 Willis | |1 is | |1 a | |1 billion | |0 times | |0 better | |1 in | |0 service | |1 and | |0 quality | |1 of | |1 the | |0 meal | .
I |0 have | |1 no | |0 idea | |0 how | |0 China | |0 Delight | |0 won | |0 number | |1 1 | |0 Chinese | |0 restaurant | |1 in | |0 Montgomery | - There |0 needs | to |1 be | |1 a | |0 recount | |1 on | |1 that | |0 vote | .
|0 Terrible | |0 Service |
|1 One | |1 of | |1 the | |0 worst | |0 experiences | I |1 've | |0 ever | |0 had | |1 with | |1 a | |0 auto | |0 repair | |0 shop | .
We |0 took | our |0 vehicle | |0 in | |1 for | |1 a | |0 repair | |1 to | |1 the | |0 air | |0 conditioning | .
"|0 Approx | |1 4 | |0 months | |0 later | , |1 the | |0 compressor | |0 went | |1 out | ."
"We |0 took | it |0 back | |0 in | to |0 have | it |0 repaired | |0 again | , |1 and | |0 less | |1 than | |1 a | |0 week | |0 later | |1 the | |0 second | |0 compressor | |0 went | |1 out | ."
"We |0 went | |0 in | |1 for | |1 a | |0 third | |0 visit | |1 and | they |0 fixed | it |0 again | , |1 but | |1 this | |0 time | |0 when | we |0 picked | |1 up | |1 the | |0 car | , |1 the | |0 radio | |1 and | |0 clock | |1 did | not |0 work | ."
"|0 So | |1 for | |1 the | |0 4th | |0 time | |1 in | |1 5 | |0 months | |1 and | |1 the | |0 third | |0 time | |1 in | |1 2 | |0 weeks | , we |0 brought | |1 the | |0 car | |0 back | |0 again | ."
"|0 When | we |0 expressed | our |0 discontent | |1 to | |1 the | |0 manager | ( that |1 's | |0 right | , |1 the | |0 manager | ) , |1 did | he |0 say | he |1 would | |0 return | |1 some | |0 money | , |1 did | he |0 say | he |1 would | |0 give | |1 a | |0 discount | |1 on | our |0 next | |0 visit | , |1 did | he |0 just | |0 say | "" I |1 'm | |0 sorry | "" ."
"|0 Nope | , |0 none | |1 of | |1 the | |0 above | ."
He |0 stood | |0 there | |1 and | |0 told | us |0 how | he |1 was | n't |1 at | |0 fault | .
"It |1 was | |1 the | |0 fault | |1 of | |1 the | |0 parts | |0 supplier | , |1 and | |1 can | we |0 imagine | |0 how | he |0 felt | |0 having | to |0 put | |1 another | |1 2 | |0 hours | |1 of | |0 work | |1 in | |1 the | |0 car | ."
|1 And | what |1 did | we |0 expect | ... that he |0 bench | |0 test | |1 every | |0 part | .
"|1 At | |1 no | |0 time | |1 during | |1 the | |0 conversation | |1 did | |1 the | |0 words | , "" I |1 'm | |0 sorry | "" |0 ever | |0 come | |1 out | |1 of | his |0 mouth | ."
"I , |1 nor | anyone |0 else | |1 in | my |0 family | , |1 will | |0 ever | |0 go | |1 to | |0 Sun | |0 Devil | |0 Auto | |0 again | ."
"|0 Well | , unless |0 of | |0 course | |1 the | |0 third | |0 compressor | he |0 put | |1 in | |1 the | |0 car | |0 goes | |1 out | ."
|1 Do | not |0 use | |1 this | |0 company | !
I |0 dropped | |1 off | |1 a | |0 sheet | |0 metal | |0 piece | that I |0 needed | |0 copied | |1 due | to th it |1 was | |0 needing | to |1 be | |0 replaced | .
I |0 asked | if they |1 could | |0 copy | |1 the | |0 piece | I |0 dropped | |1 off | .
They |0 said | it |1 would | |1 be | |0 made | |0 exactly | |1 like | |1 the | |1 one | I |0 needed | to |0 replace | .
I |0 picked | it |1 up | |0 when | it |1 was | |0 finished | |1 and | |1 was | |0 charge | |1 30.00 | .
|0 When | I |0 got | |1 to | |1 the | |0 job | |1 and | |0 tried | to |0 insert | |1 the | |0 new | |0 piece | |1 of | |0 metal | IT |1 WOULD | NOT |0 FIT | !!
I |0 took | |1 the | |0 original | |0 piece | |1 of | |0 metal | |1 and | |0 rigged | it to |0 make | |0 due | since I |0 had | to |0 complete | |1 the | |0 job | .
I |0 took | |1 the | |0 receipt | |1 and | |1 the | |0 metal | that |1 did | not |0 fit | |1 and | |0 asked | |0 Pomper | |1 for | my |0 money | |0 back | .
|1 The | |0 girl | |1 at | |1 the | |0 desk | |1 was | |0 sooo | |0 rude | I |1 could | not |0 believe | it !
She |0 told | me she |1 could | not |0 use | |1 the | |0 piece | I |1 was | |0 returning | |1 and | |1 the | |0 company | |1 would | |0 only | |0 put | it |1 in | |1 the | |0 trash | |0 so | I |1 could | not |0 return | it .
I |0 explained | I |1 did | not |0 get | what I |0 paid | |1 for | .
She |0 asked | me to |0 bring | |1 the | |0 original | |0 piece | |0 back | |1 and | I |0 told | her I |0 had | to |0 use | it |1 on | |1 the | |0 job | .
She |0 told | me that |1 was | |0 to | |0 bad | she |1 would | |0 do | nothing to |0 help | me since she |1 could | not |0 use | |1 or | |0 resell | |1 the | |0 piece | .
I |0 said | I |1 was | |0 going | to |0 trash | it |0 also | |1 and | |1 could | I |0 at | |0 least | |0 have | |1 a | |0 credit | .
|1 With | |1 a | |0 smirk | |1 on | her |0 face | she |0 told | me |1 NO | |0 MONEY | |1 IS | |1 BEING | |0 RETURNED | |1 and | THAT |1 IS | |1 THE | |0 WAY | IT |0 WAS | .
|1 DO | NOT |0 USE | |1 THIS | |0 COMPANY | .
There |0 are | |0 to | |0 many | |0 people | that |0 need | our |0 business | to |0 have | to |0 put | |1 up | |1 with | |1 this | |0 unfair | |0 treatment | !!!!!
I |1 would | |0 NEVER | |0 recommend | |1 this | |0 gym | |1 to | anyone |1 and | |0 unfortunately | this |1 is | |0 based | |0 solely | |1 on | |1 the | |0 owner | 's |0 own | |0 unprofessionalism | .
|0 When | I |0 originally | |0 joined | |1 in | |0 January | I |0 only | |1 did | |0 so | because I |1 was | |0 told | I |1 would | |1 be | |0 able | to |0 cancel | |1 the | |1 12 | |0 month | |0 membership | if I |1 was | to |0 move | |0 away | .
I |0 signed | |1 up | |1 with | |1 one | |1 of | |1 the | |0 staff | who |1 was | |0 very | |0 pleasant | |1 and | |0 professional | .
|0 Actually | |0 working | |1 out | |0 there | |1 was | |0 good | - |1 the | |0 machines | |1 are | |0 nice | |1 and | |1 the | |0 classes | |1 are | |0 fun | .
|1 The | |0 locker | |0 room | |1 is | |0 certainly | |0 lacking | - I |1 would | |0 never | |0 shower | |1 or | |0 change | |0 there | .
They |0 need | to |0 update | |1 the | |0 locker | |0 rooms | |0 ASAP | .
|0 Back | |1 to | my |0 poor | |0 rating | - I |1 was | |0 excepted | |1 to | |0 medical | |0 school | |1 and | |0 went | |0 in | to |0 cancel | my |0 membership | as I |1 was | |0 told | I |1 could | |0 do | since I |1 was | |0 moving | |0 away | .
"|1 The | |0 owner | |1 was | |0 VERY | |0 rude | , |0 accused | me of |0 not | |0 reading | my |0 contract | , |1 and | |0 basically | |0 told | me to |0 shut | |1 up | |0 when | I |1 was | |0 trying | to |0 ask | |0 questions | to |0 further | |0 understand | |1 the | |0 process | of |0 canceling | my |0 membership | ."
I |1 was | |0 able | to |0 cancel | it |1 but | |0 only | after |0 paying | |1 a | $ |1 50 | |0 fee | ( which |1 the | |0 staff | |0 person | who |0 signed | me |1 up | |0 stated | I |1 would | not |0 have | to |0 pay | if I |0 had | |0 proof | |1 of | |0 moving | ) |1 and | |1 being | |0 spoken | |1 to | |1 in | |1 a | |0 very | |0 belittling | |0 manner | .
I |1 would | |0 understand | if I |1 was | |1 being | |0 treated | |1 this | |0 way | |1 by | |1 a | |0 staff | |0 member | |1 but | |1 the | |0 club | 's |0 actual | |0 OWNER | ?!
|0 Bad | |1 for | |0 business | .
I |1 was | |0 appalled | .
I |1 will | |0 never | |0 recommend | |1 this | |0 gym | |1 to | |1 any | |0 woman | .
|1 The | |0 equipment | |1 and | |0 classes | |1 are | n't |0 good | |0 enough | to |0 deal | |1 with | |1 the | |0 rudeness | |1 from | |1 the | |0 staff | !!!
There |0 are | |0 better | |0 places | |1 on | |1 the | |0 Cape | - |0 FITNESS | |0 500 | !
|1 The | |0 Salon | |0 Experience | |1 from | |0 Hell |
I |0 feel | |0 obligated | to |0 share | |1 this | |0 story | .
|0 Right | |1 out | |1 of | |0 college | I |0 called | |1 the | |0 salon | |1 and | |0 explained | my |0 situation | .
"|0 Just | |0 graduated | , |0 just | |0 moved | , not |0 rich | , |1 and | |0 starting | |0 new | |0 job | |0 soon | ."
"I |0 never | |0 got | |1 a | |0 price | |0 quote | |1 over | |1 the | |0 phone | |1 and | they |0 take | your |0 cc | |0 info | |0 just | to |0 make | |1 the | |0 appointment | because if you |1 do | n't |0 show | |1 up | , they |1 'll | |0 charge | you ."
I |0 had | |1 this | |0 ridiculous | |0 celebrity | |0 stylist | |1 from | |0 LA | |0 named | |0 Derrick | .
"After he |0 already | |0 put | |0 product | |1 on | my |0 hair | he |0 said | "" I |1 should | |0 warn | you , I |1 'm | |0 expensive | . """
"What |1 was | I |0 supposed | to |0 do | , |0 say | I |1 ca | n't |0 afford | you |1 and | |0 walk | |0 out | |1 with | |0 crap | |0 all | |1 over | my |0 hair | ."
I |0 wanted | to |1 be | |0 very | |0 blonde | |1 and | |0 instead | he |0 pulled | my |0 root | |0 color | |1 throughout | my |0 whole | |0 hair | which |1 is | |1 a | |0 gross | |0 mousey | |0 brown | .
"|1 The | |0 other | |0 stylists | |1 around | me |0 kept | |0 pressuring | me |0 saying | he |1 's | |0 so | |0 wonderful | , you |1 're | |0 going | to |0 love | your |0 hair | ."
$ |1 400 | |0 later | my |0 jaw | |0 dropped | |0 when | |1 the | |0 receptionist | |0 told | me |1 the | |0 total | .
"|0 Derrick | |0 did | |1 a | |0 terrible | |0 job | , |1 was | |1 a | |0 complete | |0 jerk | |1 the | |0 entire | |0 time | , |1 and | I |0 had | |1 no | |0 warning | |1 as | |1 to | |1 the | |0 price | ."
I |0 cried | |1 the | |0 entire | |0 way | |0 home | .
"He |0 then | "" |0 fixed | "" it |1 for | |0 free | |1 but | it |0 still | |0 looked | |1 like | |0 crap | ."
I |1 will | |0 never | |0 go | |0 back | .
It |1 was | |1 the | |0 salon | |0 experience | |1 from | |0 absolutely | |0 Hell | .
He |0 also | |0 told | me that he |0 worked | |1 on | |1 the | |0 cast | |1 of | |0 will | |1 and | |0 grace | |1 and | that they |1 were | |0 all | |0 jerks | .
That |1 's | my |0 favorite | |0 show | |1 of | |1 all | |0 time | .
I |1 'm | |0 pretty | |0 sure | |1 for | |1 the | |0 cast | that it |1 was | |1 the | |0 other | |0 way | |0 around | .
|0 Maybe | he |1 did | n't |0 do | |1 a | |0 good | |0 job | |1 and | they |0 told | him |0 so | .
|0 Absolute | |0 Nightmare | !
|0 STAY | |0 AWAY | !
|0 Very | |0 unhappy | ...
"|0 Working | |1 with | |0 Rod | |0 Jacobsen | |1 was | my |0 first | |0 experience | |0 working | |1 with | |1 a | |0 CPA | , |0 so | I |1 did | not |0 know | what to |0 expect | ."
That |0 said | - he |0 seemed | to |1 be | |0 doing | |0 well | |0 enough | .
"|0 However | , |0 then | I |0 asked | to |0 amend | my |0 return | to |0 apply | |1 a | |0 credit | I |1 had | |0 just | |0 become | |0 eligible | |1 for | ."
"I |0 expected | to |0 pay | |1 for | |1 this | |0 service | , |1 but | |0 imagine | my |0 surprise | |0 when | I |0 received | |1 a | |0 bill | |1 for | |0 MORE | than what I |0 paid | to |0 have | |1 the | |0 original | |0 return | |0 prepared | ."
"|0 Asked | |0 why | , |0 Rod | |0 simply | |0 told | me that he |0 had | to |0 research | |0 how | to |0 do | |1 the | |0 amendment | ( it |1 was | |1 an | |0 amended | to |0 show | that I |1 had | |0 purchased | |1 a | |0 home | - nothing |1 out | |1 of | |1 the | |0 ordinary | , one |1 would | |0 think | ) |1 and | that |0 took | |0 time | to |0 figure | |1 out | ."
"|0 Well | , that |1 was | |0 strike | |1 one | ."
"I |1 was | n't |0 going | to |0 use | them |0 again | , |1 but | I |1 was | |0 going | to |0 leave | it |1 at | that ."
"|0 However | , |0 now | that I |1 have | |0 come | to |0 realize | that I |1 am | |0 going | to |0 owe | |1 the | |0 IRS | $ |1 6,000 | + despite |0 doing | |0 exactly | what |0 Rod | |0 told | me to |0 do | , I |0 feel | I |0 have | to |0 voice | my |0 opinion | ."
"|0 Last | |0 year | , after |1 all | |1 was | |0 said | |1 and | |0 done | , I |0 asked | |0 Rod | whether my |0 payment | |0 structure | |1 would | |0 leave | me |1 with | |1 no | / |0 little | |0 tax | |0 liability | |1 at | |1 the | |0 end | |1 of | |1 the | |0 year | ."
He |0 said | |0 yes | .
"|0 Well | , |0 again | , I |1 am | |0 now | |0 faced | |1 with | |1 a | |0 tax | |0 bill | |1 of | $ |1 6,000 | + , |1 all | |0 due | |1 on | |0 April | |1 15 | , |1 2010 | |1 and | |1 all | that |0 Rod | |0 has | to |0 say | |1 to | |1 the | |0 matter | |0 is | ' |0 well | , you |1 wo | n't |0 have | to |0 pay | |1 a | |0 penalty | . '"
"I |1 may | not |0 have | to |0 pay | |1 a | |0 penalty | , |0 yet | , |1 but | this |1 is | NOT what I |0 had | |1 in | |0 mind | |0 when | |0 hired | |1 these | |0 guys | ."
"|1 In | |1 the | |0 words | |1 of | my |0 new | |0 accountant | , THEY |0 LET | ME |1 DOWN | !"
"|0 Bit | |0 sketchy | , |0 sporadic | |0 delivery | |0 times |"
I |0 bought | |0 about | |0 half | |1 of | |1 the | |0 furniture | I |0 own | |1 from | |1 this | |0 place | .
|0 Why | ?
Because they |0 cut | me |0 good | |0 deals | if I |0 paid | |1 in | |0 cash | .
"|0 Sketchy | , |0 right | ?"
|0 Well | they |0 came | |0 through | |1 and | |0 delivered | |0 almost | |1 all | |1 of | my |0 items | |1 within | |1 a | |0 few | |0 days | .
( They |0 even | |0 got | me |1 a | |0 couch | |0 pretty | |0 quickly | . )
"|1 The | |0 guy | who |1 was | |0 cutting | me |1 the | |0 deals | |1 and | |0 getting | me |1 the | |0 furniture | |0 quickly | , |0 Ahmed | , |1 was | |0 nice | |1 and | |0 mostly | |0 professional | , |1 except | |1 the | |0 semi-sketchiness | ."
"|0 Then | |1 one | |0 day | , |0 Ahmed | |0 left | |1 the | |0 country | , |0 not | to |0 return | |1 for | |0 months | , WITHOUT |0 informing | me ."
He |0 also | |0 neglected | to |0 tell | |1 the | |0 other | |0 person | |0 working | |1 at | |1 the | |0 store | |1 about | |1 a | |0 dining | |0 room | |0 table | that I |1 had | |0 ordered | |1 and | that |1 was | |0 supposed | to |1 be | |0 coming | |0 in | .
|1 The | |0 other | |0 person | |0 working | |1 at | |1 the | |0 store | |1 did | n't |0 know | that I |0 still | |0 had | |1 this | |0 table | |0 coming | .
"I |1 had | |0 paid | |1 in | |0 cash | , |1 and | he |0 said | he |0 had | |1 no | |0 receipt | / |0 record | |1 of | my |0 purchase | ."
"I |0 came | |0 back | |1 with | |1 the | |0 receipt | |0 Ahmed | |1 had | |0 provided | |1 upon | my |0 purchase | , |1 and | |1 the | |0 guy | |0 took | |0 forever | to |0 copy | it |1 but | |0 said | that he |1 would | |0 take | |0 care | |1 of | |1 the | |0 situation | ."
I |0 waited | .
|1 And | |0 waited | .
He |0 never | |0 once | |0 contacted | us .
I |1 've | |0 had | to |0 pester | |1 this | |0 new | |0 guy | |0 several | |0 times | to |0 ask | |0 when | my |0 table | |1 will | |0 arrive | .
He |0 kept | |0 saying | |0 different | |0 arrival | / |0 delivery | |0 dates | |1 and | |1 did | n't |0 seem | |0 terribly | |0 apologetic | .
"It |1 has | |1 been | |1 3 | |0 weeks | |1 and | I |0 STILL | |1 do | n't |0 have | my |0 table | ( which |1 was | NOT |0 cheap | , I |1 might | |0 add | ) ."
"|0 Point | |0 is | : You |1 might | |1 be | |0 able | to |0 get | |1 a | |0 good | |0 deal | |1 on | |1 some | |0 nice | |0 furniture | -- which I |1 did | -- |1 but | they |1 're | not |0 very | |0 communicative | |1 and | |0 god | |0 forbid | something |0 goes | |0 wrong | , you |1 'll | |0 have | to |0 fight | to |0 get | it |0 resolved | ."
|0 Poor | |0 Service |
|0 Run | |1 do | n't |0 walk | .
My |0 experience | |1 with | |0 Home | |0 Delivery | |0 Service | |1 has | |1 been | |1 one | |1 of | |0 disappointment | |1 and | |0 anger | .
If I |1 could | |0 give | them |1 a | |0 lower | |0 rating | |1 than | |0 poor | I |1 would | .
"|1 On | |0 August | |0 21st | , |1 2009 | I |0 ordered | |0 furniture | |1 from | |0 Hickory | |0 Furniture | |0 Mart | |1 and | |0 contracted | for |0 HDS | to |0 deliver | it ."
|1 After | |1 seventeen | |0 days | |1 the | |0 delivery | |0 van | |0 showed | |1 up | |1 at | my |0 home | |1 minus | |1 two | |0 pieces | .
I |1 was | |0 later | |0 told | they |1 had | |1 been | |0 left | |1 at | |1 the | |0 warehouse | |1 and | |1 some | |0 future | |0 date | they |1 would | |1 be | |0 delivered | .
|1 No | |1 one | |1 will | |0 give | me |1 a | |0 date | .
"I |0 spent | $ |1 2300 | |1 on | |1 the | |0 bedroom | |0 suite | , which |1 was | |0 complete | |1 and | |0 excellent | |0 condition | |1 on | |1 the | |0 showroom | |0 floor | ."

|0 Excellent | |0 Driving | |0 School |
I |1 was | |0 involved | |1 in | |1 a | |0 car | |0 accident | |1 20 | |0 years | |0 ago | |1 and | |1 since | |0 then | I |1 've | |1 been | |1 a | |0 nervous | |0 wreck | |1 and | |1 have | n't |1 been | |1 behind | |1 the | |0 wheel | .

I |0 called | |1 the | |0 school | |0 most | |0 probably | |1 10 | |0 times | before I |0 finally | |0 enrolled | |1 in | |1 a | |1 20 | |0 hour | |0 package | .

"|1 Five | |0 minutes | |1 before | my |0 initial | |0 lesson | , I |0 got | |1 a | |0 call | |1 from | |0 Gerry | |0 advising | me |1 of | his |0 arrival | |1 and | to |0 come | |0 down | |0 as | |0 soon | as I |1 was | |0 ready | ."
My |0 heart | |0 pounded | as I |0 walked | |0 down | |1 and | |0 pounded | |0 even | |0 faster | upon |0 seeing | |0 Gerry | |1 in | |1 an | |0 SUV | - |0 Lexus | !

|0 Review | |1 on | |0 House | |1 of | |0 Joy | |0 Chinese | |0 Restaurant |
My |0 family | |1 and | I |0 moved | |1 to | |0 San | |0 Antonio | |1 a | |0 year | |0 ago | |1 and | |1 have | |0 tried | |0 almost | |1 all | |1 of | |1 the | |0 Chinese | |0 Restaurants | because we |0 love | |0 Chinese | |0 food | .
|0 Well | it |0 took | us |1 a | |0 while | to |0 find | |1 one | that we |0 liked | .
|1 But | we |1 do | n't |0 just | |0 like | |0 House | |1 of | |0 Joy | WE |0 LOVE | IT .
Everything we |1 have | |0 gotten | |0 there | |1 has | |1 been | |0 more | |0 authentic | |1 and | |0 better | |0 tasting | |1 than | |1 any | |0 other | |0 Chinese | |0 restaurant | |1 in | |1 the | |0 San | |0 Antonio | |0 area | we |1 have | |1 been | |1 to | -- |1 and | |0 trust | me we |1 have | |1 been | |1 to | |1 a | |0 lot | |1 of | them .
We |0 just | |0 happen | to |0 stumble | |1 across | |1 this | |0 little | |0 restaurant | |1 one | |0 day | |0 when | we |0 had | to |0 visit | |1 the | |0 Bexar | |0 County | |0 Tax | |0 Office | |1 off | |1 of | |0 Bandera | |0 Road | .
We |0 stopped | |0 in | |1 and | |0 got | |1 some | |0 take | |0 out | |1 and | |1 can | not |0 stop | |0 going | |0 back | .
They |0 have | |1 the | |0 best | |0 Egg | |0 Drop | |0 Soup | I |1 have | |0 ever | |0 tasted | .
We |0 also | |0 love | their |0 Egg | |0 Rolls | |1 and | |0 Spring | |0 Rolls | .
|1 And | |1 every | |0 entree | we |1 have | |0 ordered | |1 is | |0 perfect | .
Everything |1 is | |0 always | |0 cooked | |0 fresh | |1 and | |0 tastes | |0 fresh | .
Their |0 prices | |1 are | |0 extremely | |0 reasonable | |1 for | |1 the | |0 amount | |1 of | |0 food | you |0 receive | .
|1 The | |0 staff | |1 is | |0 also | |0 just | |0 so | |0 pleasant | to |0 deal | |1 with | .
They |1 are | |0 also | |0 quick | at |0 getting | your |0 order | |0 out | |1 to | you .
You |1 do | n't |0 have | to |0 sit | |1 and | |0 wait | |0 around | |0 forever | |1 like | |0 most | |0 places | !!
|0 So | anyone |0 looking | |1 for | |1 an | |0 Excellent | |0 night | |0 out | |1 for | |0 Chinese | |1 or | |0 maybe | |0 just | |0 lunch | |1 should | |0 stop | |0 in | |1 and | |0 try | it because I |0 promise | you |1 2 | |0 things | --- You |1 wo | n't |0 regret | it !!
|1 and | you |1 will | |0 go | |0 back | |1 for | |0 more | !!!

We |1 are | |1 from | |0 Virginia | |1 and | |0 just | |0 moved | |0 here | |1 a | |0 year | |0 ago | .
|0 So | |1 that | |0 comment | |1 is | |0 completely | |0 false | .
Because we |0 think | IT |1 'S | |1 THE | |0 BEST | !!!
|1 and | we |1 do | n't |0 know | them |1 except | for |0 eating | |0 there | .
|0 Dr. | |0 Strzalka | |1 at | |0 Flagship | |0 CVTS | |1 is | not |1 a | |0 good | |0 doctor |
"I |1 am | not |0 sure | |1 about | |1 the | |0 quality | |1 of | |1 the | |0 other | |0 doctors | |0 there | , |1 but | i |1 do | |0 know | |1 from | |0 personal | |0 experience | that |0 Dr. | |0 Christopher | |0 T. | |0 Strzalka | |1 is | not |1 a | |0 man | |1 of | his |0 word | , |1 and | |1 is | |0 also | |0 very | |0 CRUEL | |1 AND | |0 UNCARING | !!"
He |1 was | |0 going | to |0 operate | |1 and | |0 replace | my |0 bicuspid | |0 aortic | |0 valve | |1 due | |1 to | |0 critical | |0 aortic | |0 stenosis | .
"I |0 had | |1 a | |0 surgery | |0 date | |1 of | |0 July | |1 17 | , |1 2008 | ."
"|0 Then | he |0 renigged | |0 when | he |0 read | my |0 Health | |0 Care | |0 Proxy | , |0 even | though i |0 agreed | to |1 be | |1 on | |1 the | |0 ventilator | |1 for | |1 2 | |0 months | |0 following | |0 surgery | ( as he |1 had | |0 twice | |0 stated | i |1 must | |0 agree | |1 to | ) ."
"He |0 later | |0 said | that |1 by | |1 2 | |0 months | he "" |0 meant | |0 at | |0 least | |1 two | |0 months | "" ."
|1 Two | |0 months | |1 and | |0 at | |0 least | |1 two | |0 months | |1 are | |0 totally | |0 different | |0 things | .
"He |1 did | not |0 even | |0 give | me |1 the | |0 chance | to |0 say | i |1 would | |0 stay | |1 on | |1 the | |0 ventilator | |0 longer | , which i |1 would | |1 have | ."
|1 A | |0 Health | |0 Care | |0 Proxy | |1 is | not |0 written | |1 in | |0 stone | |1 and | |1 can | |1 be | |0 changed | .
He |0 also | |0 never | |0 even | |0 said | he |1 was | |0 sorry | .
|0 Just | |0 said | i |1 was | |0 inoperable | |1 and | |0 walked | |1 out | |1 of | |1 the | |0 hospital | |0 room | .
"|0 So | , |0 therefore | , |0 now | he |0 says | i |1 am | |0 inoperable | ( |0 even | though i |1 am | not |1 100 | % |0 inoperable | ) , |1 and | he |1 is | |0 letting | me |0 die | ."
"I |1 am | |0 just | |0 middle | |0 aged | |1 and | |1 do | not |0 want | to |0 die | , |1 but | |0 thanks | |1 to | |1 this | |0 doctor | i |0 have | |1 no | |0 other | |0 alternatives | ."
"I , |1 along | |1 with | my |0 friends | , |0 consider | |1 this | |0 doctor | to |1 be | |1 the | |0 cause | |1 of | my |0 death | as he |1 is | not |0 even | |0 trying | to |0 save | my |0 life | by |0 operating | ."
"|0 Even | my |0 PA | i |0 went | |1 to | |1 the | |0 other | |0 day | |0 said | "" it |1 must | |0 by | |0 comforting | to |1 have | |0 gone | |1 to | |1 a | |0 heart | |0 surgeon | |1 like | him who |1 will | |0 do | nothing |1 for | you "" ."
He |0 said | it |0 sarcastically | .
"If you |0 want | |1 a | |0 doctor | who |1 will | |0 lie | |1 to | you |1 and | |0 say | he |1 will | |0 operate | |1 and | |0 then | |0 change | his |0 mind | , |1 and | not |0 know | what he |1 is | |0 talking | |1 about | |0 when | he |0 recommends | |0 procedures | |1 at | |0 other | |0 hospitals | |1 and | |0 says | they |0 are | what you |0 need | , |0 when | they |1 will | not |0 work | |1 for | you , |0 go | |1 to | |1 this | |0 doctor | ... he |1 is | |1 the | |0 one | |1 for | you ."
What you |1 can | |0 learn | |1 from | |1 the | |0 below | ' |0 bad | |0 experience | ' .
I |1 would | |0 suggest | |0 not | |0 avoiding | |0 Second | |0 Home | |0 based | |1 on | |1 the | ' |0 bad | |0 experience | ' |0 review | .
"I |1 'd | |0 probably | |1 be | |0 more | |0 inclined | to |0 board | my |1 two | |0 dogs | |0 here | , |0 seeing | that they |1 do | n't |0 just | |0 take | |1 every | |0 dog | |0 coming | |0 in | ."
"I |1 've | |0 toured | |1 this | |0 place | |1 and | |1 was | |0 impressed | |1 by | |0 how | |0 clean | |1 the | |0 place | |1 was | , |1 and | |1 all | |1 the | |0 options | |1 for | |1 the | |0 dogs | ."
It |1 's | |0 unfortunate | that |0 bmil | |0 believed | that his ' |0 perfect | ' |0 dog | |1 was | not |0 given | |1 the | |0 right | |0 opportunity | to |0 prove | himself .
"|1 But | I |1 've | |0 done | |0 hundreds | |1 of | |0 dog | |0 introductions | myself ( |1 another | |0 place | , I |1 do | n't |0 work | |0 here | ) , |1 and | |0 owners | |1 can | |0 have | |0 unrealistic | |0 expectations | |1 and | |0 views | of what they |0 see | |0 when | their |0 dogs | |0 meet | |0 other | |0 dogs | ."
|0 Workers | who |0 do | |1 these | |0 introductions | |0 look | |1 at | |1 the | |0 interaction | |0 objectively | ; |1 and | it |1 's | |0 good | to |0 see | they |1 are | |0 able | |1 and | |0 willing | to |0 say | |0 no | if they |0 feel | there |1 would | |0 be | |1 a | |0 problem | .
"It |0 sounds | ( |0 according | |1 to | your |0 own | |0 statement | ) that they |0 had | |1 a | |0 roomful | |1 of | |0 dogs | , |0 so | they |1 must | |1 be | |0 doing | something |0 right | - |1 and | |1 are | |0 keeping | |1 those | |0 dogs | |0 safe | |1 from | |0 potential | |0 problems | ."
"You |0 say | you |0 work | |1 a | |0 lot | , |1 and | that you |0 have | |1 a | |0 young | |0 dog | ; |0 so | I |0 have | |0 little | |0 doubt | that your |0 dog | |1 is | |0 just | |0 filled | |1 with | |0 energy | to |0 burn | ; |1 and | it |1 is | |0 good | |1 of | you to |0 look | |1 for | |1 a | |0 place | to |0 take | him ."
|1 But | not |1 at | |1 a | |0 risk | |1 to | |0 other | |0 people | 's |0 pets | .
"You |1 were | |0 clearly | |0 given | |1 another | |0 alternative | |1 by | |0 Second | |0 Home | , to |0 board | him - which |1 might | |1 have | |0 given | your |0 dog | |1 a | |0 chance | to |0 come | |1 and | |0 go | |1 from | |0 Second | |0 Home | |1 a | |0 couple | |0 times | , |0 getting | |0 used | |1 to | |1 the | |0 place | |1 and | |0 maybe | |0 facilitating | |1 another | |0 attempt | to |0 get | |1 into | |0 daycare | |0 later | ."
|1 No | |0 business | |1 is | |0 going | to |0 push | |0 customers | |0 away | |1 without | |0 good | |0 reason | ; |0 so | |1 is | n't it |0 reasonable | to |0 think | they |1 might | |0 know | what they |1 're | |0 doing | ?
"My |0 dogs | |1 are | |0 far | |1 from | |0 perfect | , |1 and | |1 one | |1 of | them I |0 believe | |1 would | |1 be | |1 a | |0 little | |0 much | |1 for | |0 daycare | |0 here | herself ( |0 at | |0 least | |0 initially | ) ."
"|1 Be | |1 a | |0 little | |0 more | |0 reasonable | |1 with | your |0 expectations | |1 of | |1 a | |0 place | |1 like | this ; |1 and | |0 maybe | |1 do | n't |0 jump | |1 to | |0 personal | |0 attacks | |0 suggesting | that they |1 do | n't |0 want | to |0 work | |0 hard | , |0 just | because you |0 bruised | your |0 own | |0 ego | ."

|0 Quick | to |0 take | |0 money | |1 but | not |0 quick | to |0 fix | |1 a | |0 problem | !
|0 B&B | |0 came | |0 out | |0 very | |0 quickly | to |0 give | us our |0 quote | |0 back | |1 in | |0 June | .
"They |1 were | |0 very | |0 polite | , |0 eager | to |0 answer | |1 any | |0 questions | |1 and | |0 willing | to |0 wait | for us to |0 return | |1 from | |0 vacation | to |0 begin | |0 installing | our |0 fence | ."
"Our |0 fence | |1 was | |0 installed | |0 quickly | |1 in | |0 August | |1 and | they |0 had | their |0 money | |1 and | |0 left | |0 saying | "" |0 Workmanship | |1 is | |0 guaranteed | |1 for | |1 a | |0 year | ! "" ."
|1 Within | |1 a | |0 week | we |0 noticed | |1 one | |1 of | |1 the | |0 boards | |1 on | our |0 gate | |0 splitting | |0 where | |1 a | |0 nail | |1 had | |0 gone | |0 in | .
We |0 called | our |0 representative | who |0 assured | me he |1 would | |0 call | |1 the | |0 office | |1 and | |0 have | it |0 taken | |0 care | |1 of | .
We |0 heard | nothing .
We |0 then | |0 called | |1 the | |0 office | |1 and | |1 the | |0 man | we |0 spoke | |1 to | |0 said | he |1 'd | |0 send | someone |0 out | to |0 look | |1 at | it |1 but | |1 could | n't |0 promise | |0 when | - |1 two | |0 weeks | |0 came | |1 and | |0 went | |1 and | we |0 heard | nothing .
"I |0 just | |0 called | |0 again | |1 and | |1 was | |0 told | that |0 workmanship | , |1 not | |0 wood | , |1 is | |0 guaranteed | |1 for | |1 a | |0 year | - |0 well | |1 in | my |0 opinion | - |1 the | |0 wood | |0 split | |1 due | |1 to | |1 a | |0 nail | which |1 is | |0 part | |1 of | |0 workmanship | !"
"She |0 even | |0 went | |0 so | |0 far | as to |0 say | "" You |1 r | |0 calling | |1 about | |1 one | |0 board | ? """
|0 Well | - |0 when | you |0 pay | |1 over | $ |1 1000 | |1 for | something you |0 want | it to |0 hold | |1 up | |1 and | |0 look | |0 good | !!!
|0 YES | !
I |1 WAS | |0 calling | |1 about | |1 one | |0 board | !!
I |1 'm | |0 very | |0 frustrated | |1 at | |1 this | |0 point | - it |1 would | |0 take | |1 all | |1 of | |1 10 | |0 min | for them to |0 come | |0 by | |1 and | |0 replace | |1 the | |1 one | |0 board | that |1 is | |0 cracked | ( |1 the | |0 crack | |1 is | |0 deep | |0 enough | to |0 stick | |1 a | |0 penny | |1 in | it |1 and | it |0 goes | |0 clear | |0 through | ) |1 yet | they |1 do | not |0 want | to |0 take | |1 the | |0 time | to |0 bother | with what |0 once | |1 WAS | |1 a | |0 happy | |0 customer | |1 and | |1 has | |0 now | |0 become | |1 a | |0 dissatisfied | |0 customer | .
|0 So | I |0 figure | if they |1 do | n't |0 want | to |0 take | |1 the | |0 time | to |0 fix | |1 the | |0 fence | that they |0 installed | |0 then | I |1 'll | |0 take | |1 the | |0 time | to |0 let | everyone I |1 can | |0 know | about |0 how | they |0 treat | |0 customers | once they |0 have | your |0 money | !!!

"|0 When | |1 the | |0 fence | |1 was | |0 first | |0 installed | I |1 would | |1 have | |0 given | them |1 five | |0 stars | , |0 now | |1 for | their |0 poor | |0 customer | |0 follow | - |0 up | |1 and | |0 unwillingness | to |0 fix | |1 the | |0 fence | they |1 have | |0 dropped | |1 to | |1 a | |1 one | - |0 star | |1 in | my |0 opinion | !"

I |0 then | |0 called | |1 the | |1 800 | |0 number | ( which |1 was | |0 answered | ) |1 and | |0 inquired | |1 about | |0 last | |0 minute | |0 rates | .
"They |0 had | |1 a | |0 room | |1 with | |1 a | $ |1 99 | |0 rate | , which I |0 booked | ."
"|1 The | |0 room | |1 was | |0 supposed | to |1 be | |1 on | |1 the | |0 2nd | |0 floor | , |1 but | they |0 put | us |1 on | |1 the | |0 3rd | ."

|0 Quit | |1 with | |1 the | |0 overstatements | !
"|1 The | |0 worst | |0 thing | that |1 can | |0 happen | |1 for | |1 any | |0 restaurant | |1 like | |0 Zahav | |0 is | to |0 have | |0 too | |0 many | |0 people | |0 write | |0 hyperbolic | |0 reviews | |0 making | |0 claims | that "" everyone "" |1 is | |0 going | to "" |0 love | "" |1 the | |0 food | , |0 decor | |1 and | |0 service | ."
"|1 The | |0 truth | |0 is | , |1 in | my |1 and | my |0 dining | |0 partners | ' |0 experience | , this |1 is | |1 a | |0 fine | |0 little | |0 restaurant | |1 with | |1 some | |0 unique | |0 food | ."

"|0 Now | , |1 the | |0 best | |1 of | |1 that | |0 unique | |0 food | |0 comes | |1 at | |1 the | |0 very | |0 beginning | |1 of | |1 the | |0 meal | ."
|1 The | |0 salatim | |0 salads | |1 are | |1 the | |0 smallest | |0 plates | I |1 've | |0 ever | |0 seen | |0 placed | |1 in | |0 front | |1 of | me ( you |1 would | |0 most | |0 likely | |0 think | they |1 were | |0 condiments | if it |1 were | n't |0 explained | |1 to | you ) .
"Though they |1 are | |0 mostly | |0 excellent | , you |0 generally | |1 do | n't |0 get | |0 enough | |0 forkfuls | to |0 know | if you |0 really | |0 love | them ."
"That |1 being | |0 said | , |1 the | |0 laffa | |1 and | |0 hummus | |1 are | |1 out | |1 of | |1 this | |0 world | ."
"|0 Then | |0 again | , |1 for | |1 the | |1 three | |1 of | us who |0 dined | |0 together | , |1 two | |0 pieces | |1 of | |0 flatbread | |0 left | us |0 fighting | |1 for | |0 more | , |1 and | |0 licking | |1 the | |0 hummus | |1 from | our |0 fingers | ( |1 and | |0 yes | , |1 those | |1 two | |0 pieces | |1 of | |0 flatbread | |1 did | |0 represent | |1 a | |1 three | - |0 person | |0 order | ) ."
|0 Dinner | |1 was | |0 also | |1 an | |0 up | - |1 and | - |0 down | |0 experience | .
"|1 The | |0 vegetarian | |0 dishes | |1 and | |0 lighter | |0 fare | |1 were | |0 almost | |0 always | |0 spot | - |0 on | , while |1 the | |0 lamb | |1 was | |0 often | |0 dry | |1 and | / |1 or | |0 overcooked | ."

"|0 Oh | , |0 yes | , |1 the | |0 chocolate | |0 semifreddo | |1 was | |0 quite | |0 good | ."
"|1 The | |0 warm | |0 chocolate | |0 cake | |0 was | |0 very | |0 tasty | , |1 but | |0 served | |1 at | |0 room | |0 temperature | , |0 not | |0 warm | |1 by | |1 any | |0 stretch | |1 of | |1 the | |0 imagination | ."
"|1 And | my -- |0 no | , I |0 still | |1 do | n't |0 remember | what I |0 had | ."
"|0 Service | |1 was | |0 average | , |1 but | nothing |0 special | , |1 and | |0 restaurants | that |1 are | |0 supposed | to |1 be | |0 excellent | |1 should | |0 do | |1 a | |0 better | |0 job | of |0 training | their |0 waitstaff | to |1 be | |0 communicative | |1 and | |0 friendly | , |0 not | |0 merely | |0 capable | ."
"|0 Perhaps | |1 had | we not |0 gone | |1 into | |1 this | |0 restaurant | |0 believing | |0 Zahav | |1 was | |0 going | to |1 be | |0 golden | as its |0 name | |0 suggests | ( |1 and | as |1 the | |0 many | |0 golden | |0 reviews | |0 seem | to |0 attest | ) , we |1 would | |1 have | |0 enjoyed | |1 a | |0 decent | |0 little | |0 expensive | |0 experience | ."
"|1 But | one |1 should | not |0 go | |0 here | |0 expecting | something |0 fantastic | , unless |0 perhaps | you |1 've | |0 never | |0 had | |0 middle | - |0 eastern | |0 food | |0 before | , |1 or | |0 succulent | |0 duck | , |0 tasty | |0 lamb | , |0 decent | |0 portion | |0 sizes | |1 or | |0 actually | |0 warm | |0 chocolate | |0 desserts | ."

|1 MUST | |0 READ | - |1 Do | not |0 waste | your |0 time | |1 in | |1 this | |0 store | .
|1 At | my |0 appointment | |1 the | |0 girl | |0 helping | me |1 was | |0 unable | to |0 adequately | |0 lace | |1 up | |1 some | |1 of | |1 the | |0 dresses | .
They |0 felt | like they |1 were | |0 going | to |0 fall | |0 off | |1 of | me |1 and | it |1 was | |0 very | |0 difficult | to |0 see | what I |1 would | |0 actually | |0 look | |1 like | |0 were | I to |0 purchase | |1 some | |1 of | |1 these | |0 dresses | .
I |0 thought | it |1 would | |1 be | |1 a | |0 good | |0 idea | to |0 see | |0 how | |1 a | |0 few | that I |0 liked | |1 would | |0 look | |1 like | |1 on | |1 a | |0 model | ( by |0 looking | |1 the | |0 dress | |1 up | |0 online | ) .
"|0 So | , as I |1 was | |0 leaving | I |0 asked | |1 for | |1 the | |0 designer | / |0 dress | |0 name | |1 or | |0 style | |0 number | |0 associated | |1 with | my |0 top | |0 picks | ."
"They |0 said | they |1 were | "" |0 unable | to |0 tell | me until they |0 ordered | my |0 dress | "" ."
"|0 Hmmm | ... |1 A | |0 person | |1 can | not |0 call | |1 a | |0 company | , if you |0 have | |1 no | |0 idea | its |0 name | ( since |1 the | |0 designer | |1 is | |0 unknown | ... |0 SUPPOSEDLY | ) , |1 and | |0 order | |1 a | |0 gown | |1 without | |1 a | |0 dress | |0 name | |1 or | |0 style | |0 number | ."
|1 Do | |0 other | |0 brides | |0 fall | |1 for | this ???
"They |1 either | : a ) |1 do | n't |0 want | to |0 give | it |1 to | me because they |1 do | n't |0 want | me |0 purchasing | |1 the | |0 dress | |0 elsewhere | |1 or | b ) |1 are | |0 recreating | |1 the | |0 dresses | themselves ( ie |0 STEALING | |0 other | |0 designers | ' |0 dress | |0 designs | |1 and | "" |0 filling | |1 the | |0 orders | "" |1 by | their |0 own | |0 seamstresses | ) ."
I |1 'm | |1 no | |0 detective | |1 but | ... |0 uhh | ... |0 seriously | ?!?
"|1 Whatever | |0 type | |1 of | |0 operation | they |1 are | |0 running | , I |1 'm | not |0 interested | |1 and | if you |1 're | |0 smart | , you |1 wo | n't |0 be | |0 either | ."

"|0 Aside | |1 from | |1 that | |0 little | * |0 mystery | * , |1 one | |1 of | |1 the | |0 sales | |0 ladies | |1 was | |0 quite | |0 comfortable | |0 telling | me |0 how | |0 wrong | I |0 was | about |0 how | |1 another | |0 dress | that I |0 loved | |0 compared | |1 to | |1 one | |1 of | her |0 dresses | that I |1 was | |0 trying | |1 on | ."
"|0 Somehow | , since she |0 supposedly | |1 does | n't |0 know | |1 any | |0 names | |1 of | |0 designers | / |0 dresses | , after I |0 told | her |1 the | |0 designer | |1 and | |0 dress | |0 name | |1 of | |1 the | |0 one | I |1 was | |0 comparing | , she |0 knew | "" |0 exactly | |1 which | |0 dress | "" I |1 was | |0 referring | |1 to | |1 and | |0 disagreed | |1 with | my |0 observation | ; she |0 said | that |1 the | |0 bodice | |1 did | |0 come | |0 as | |0 low | |1 as | |1 the | |0 one | I |0 had | |0 on | ."

|0 Seriously | : |1 do | not |0 waste | your |0 time | .
|0 Other | |0 shops | |1 around | |1 this | |0 city | |0 have | |0 MUCH | |0 NICER | |1 and | |0 more | |0 TRANSPARENT | |0 owners | .
Not |0 owners | that |0 seem | like they |0 have | something to |0 hide | |1 and | |0 know | nothing |1 about | |0 common | |0 courtesy | |1 and | |0 customer | |0 service | .
I |0 felt | |0 very | |0 much | like |0 Wedding | |0 Gallery | |1 was | |1 being | |0 dishonest | |1 and | I |1 would | n't |0 trust | them to |0 lace | me |1 up | |1 in | |1 another | |0 gown | |0 let | |0 alone | |0 trust | them |1 with | |1 the | |0 gown | I |1 will | |0 wear | |1 on | |1 the | |0 most | |0 important | |0 day | |1 of | my |0 life | .
|0 AWFUL | |0 SERVICE | !
"After |0 happily | |0 visiting | |0 Sear's | |0 Automotives | |1 in | |1 the | |0 past | , I |1 was | |0 shocked | |1 at | |1 the | |0 horrible | |0 service | |0 received | |1 at | their |0 Greensboro | |0 location | ."
I |0 brought | my |0 car | |0 in | |1 on | |1 a | |0 Sunday | to |0 replace | |1 a | |0 shredded | |0 tire | .
"I |0 waited | |0 about | |1 20 | |0 minutes | |1 in | |1 the | |0 store | |0 part | before anyone |1 was | |0 able | to |0 assist | me |1 and | |1 was | |0 then | |0 told | to |0 pull | my |0 car | |1 into | |1 the | |0 shop | ( that |1 is | |0 apparently | what you |1 are | |0 supposed | to |0 do | , |1 but | |1 the | |0 big | |0 signs | |0 pointing | you |1 that | |0 way | |1 are | |1 for | |1 some | |0 reason | |0 kept | |1 inside | |1 the | |0 garage | , |0 so | you |1 do | n't |0 see | them |0 drving | |0 up | , |1 and | they |0 purposely | |0 block | |1 the | |0 front | |0 pull | - |0 up | that |1 all | |0 other | |0 Sear's | |0 use | ) ."
"Once |0 inside | , I |0 had | to |0 stand | |0 around | |1 for | |0 at | |0 least | |1 10 | |0 more | |0 minutes | before -- |0 FINALLY | -- |1 a | |0 technician | |0 got | |1 to | me ."
"Once I |0 returned | to |0 pick | |1 up | my |0 car | , you |1 can | |0 believe | I |0 spent | |1 quite | |1 a | |0 bit | |0 MORE | |0 time | |0 standing | |0 around | |0 waiting | ."
I |1 had | |0 wanted | to |0 split | |1 the | |0 total | |1 between | |1 a | |0 credit | |0 card | |1 and | |0 check | |0 card | since I |1 was | |1 being | |0 reimbursed | |1 for | |1 the | |0 tire | |1 but | |1 was | |0 told | this |1 was | n't |0 possible | .
"Once I |0 actually | |0 got | |0 back | |1 in | my |0 car | , it |1 was | |0 dirty | |1 and | |0 had | |0 grease | |0 all | |1 over | |1 the | |0 steering | |0 wheel | ."
"|0 OK | , |1 one | |0 bad | |0 experience | ... |0 fine | ."
"|1 The | |0 following | |0 Friday | , I |0 returned | |1 with | my |0 car | to |0 go | |0 ahead | |1 and | |0 replace | |1 the | |0 other | |1 3 | |0 tires | , which |1 were | |0 worn | ."
"I |1 would | not |1 have | |0 gone | |0 back | , |1 but | I |1 could | n't |0 find | |1 the | |0 particular | |0 tire | they |1 'd | |0 used | |1 in | |0 stock | |0 anywhere | |0 else | ."
"|0 Once | |0 again | , I |0 waited | |1 for | |1 quite | |1 a | |0 bit | before |1 being | |0 attended | |1 to | ."
"I |0 got | |1 the | |0 order | |0 completed | , |1 and | |0 then | |0 questioned | |1 the | |0 technician | since it |0 came | |0 out | |0 about | $ |1 40 | |0 less | than I |0 expected | ."
"He |0 said | it |1 was | |1 the | |0 same | |0 tire | , |1 and | |0 verified | this , after |0 checking | |1 both | |1 the | |0 actual | |0 tire | |1 on | my |0 car | |1 and | my |0 service | |0 papers | |1 from | |0 earlier | |1 in | |1 the | |0 week | ."
"|0 However | , |0 when | he |0 printed | |1 out | |1 the | |0 service | |0 quote | , I |1 could | |0 see | that it |1 was | NOT |1 the | |0 correct | |0 tire | , |1 and | |1 was | not |0 even | |1 an | |0 appropriate | |0 tire | |1 for | my |0 car | |0 model | ."
"|0 So | I |0 pointed | this |1 out | |1 to | him , |1 at | |1 which | |0 point | he |0 said | they |0 only | |0 had | |1 one | |1 of | |1 the | |0 correct | |0 tires | |1 in | |0 stock | ."
|0 Ok | -- |0 fine | .
|0 So | I |0 got | |0 just | my |0 other | |0 rear | |0 tire | |0 replaced | .
"They |0 promised | it |1 'd | |1 be | |0 done | |1 within | |1 an | |0 hour | , |0 so | I |0 waited | |1 in | |1 the | |0 lobby | ."
|1 Over | |1 two | |0 hours | |0 later | ( |1 and | |1 ten | |0 minutes | before they |0 closed | ) my |0 car | |1 was | |0 finally | |0 finished | .
"|1 A | |0 few | |0 minutes | after I |0 left | , I |1 was | |0 called | |1 and | |0 informed | that "" I "" |0 left | my |0 wheel | |0 lock | ( which they |1 should | |1 have | |0 left | |1 in | |1 the | |0 car | ) ."
"|0 Of | |0 course | , they |1 would | |1 be | |0 closing | |1 in | |1 5 | |0 minutes | , |0 so | I |1 would | |0 have | to |0 hurry | |1 up | |1 or | |0 get | it |1 the | |0 next | |0 day | ."
|0 Of | |0 course | I |1 could | n't |0 make | it |0 back | |1 in | |0 time | ( |1 and | they |0 apparently | |1 could | not |0 stay | |1 5 | |0 extra | |0 minutes | to |0 wait | |1 for | me ) .
"|1 The | |0 next | |0 day | , |1 no | |0 one | |1 could | |0 find | my |0 wheel | |0 lock | |1 and | |1 that | |0 particular | |0 technician | |1 was | not |0 in | ."
"|0 Of | |0 course | , they |1 could | n't |0 call | him |0 either | to |0 ask | |1 about | it because |0 apparently | they |1 do | n't |0 keep | their |0 employees | ' |0 phone | |0 numbers | ( |0 riiight | ) , |0 so | I |1 would | |0 have | to |0 return | |1 on | |0 Monday | ( |0 driving | |1 for | |1 3 | |0 days | |0 now | |1 with | |1 no | |0 wheel | |0 lock | |1 should | I |0 get | |1 a | |0 flat | ) ."
|1 On | |0 Monday | I |0 called | |1 and | |0 again | it |1 was | |1 a | |0 big | |0 to | - |0 do | to |0 find | anyone who |0 knew | anything |1 about | it .
"|0 Supposedly | they |1 will | |1 be | |0 holding | it |1 for | me |1 this | |0 evening | , |1 but | I |1 'm | |0 sure | that |1 will | |0 also | |1 be | |1 a | |0 huge | |0 ordeal | ."
|1 The | |0 employees | |1 at | |1 this | |0 Sear's | |1 are | |0 completely | |0 apathetic | |1 and | there |1 did | n't |0 seem | to |0 be | |1 any | |0 sort | |1 of | |0 management | that I |1 could | |0 see | .
